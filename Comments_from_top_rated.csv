0,Broo Doo,4,bottled 992022 the first thing that comes to mind is ipa flavored this is solid all around from start to finish there is nothing special to me that marks this brew but if i saw this available on tap id be thrilled medium to thick bodied on the palate sticky hop bitterness with a mix of pine and citrus if you know you dont like ipas then this will not change your mind but if you know you like the style then this is one to throw into the mix of options i generally prefer a lighter flavor and mouthfeel but i do like this beer
1,Broo Doo,4.24,12oz bottle etched on bottle neck is bottled 090922 seasonal 2022 release notes on label broodoo harvest ale is a seasonal ale that glorifies american hops broodoo is brewed using fresh green wet hops picked right from the vine and put into our beer vats from vine to brew house in one day enjoy slightly cloudy pale gold colored body one finger of creamy white head partial sheet of lacing on nondrinking side of the glass aroma is resin hops citrus and pine taste follows the nose and presents as a good malt base flavored with grapefruit and pineapple with a good undercurrent of pine long lasting hop dominated aftertaste medium plus mouth feel crisp and sticky very good carbonation presents as a top notch fresh hops brew
2,Broo Doo,4.15,6 oz minisnifter draft pour at lures bar  grille this is an excellent wet hop ipa with aromas and flavors of citrus and pine atop a caramel malt base the 7 abv is wellhidden next time i will definitely need to get a full pourbottle of this beer
3,Foster's Lager,3,i had this beer a couple of times before and always thought of it as a bitter and overly frothy mess but now retrying it now as world class beer expert i must say that it isnt a bad beer at all however fosters premium ale is a lot better in my opinion so if i were to see the lager in the blue can and the ale in the green can id go with the green can every time  style australian lager  tapcanbottle can  abv 5  rating 3
4,Foster's Lager,3.82,yum
5,Foster's Lager,1.76,sampled at outback steakhouse poured into a large plastic mug with handle stawgolden with quickly fading head of foam lots of streaming bubbles very faint aroma of grains and perhaps some corn luckily it wasnt skunked the taste was nothing out of the ordinary you could tell you were drinking beer mouthfeel was nothing special either crisp watery and refreshing on a hot summer day overall not as bad as you might think typical mass produced lager advertised as an australian beer but on tap in every british pub i have drunk in and thats a lot over the years fosters was actually introduced in melbourne by two brothers from new york despite what paul hogan says in the adverts fosters isnt necessarily australian for beer lol while i prefer carlton or castlemaine xxxx i would reach for a fosters over some of the snooty craft beer lol
6,Foster's Lager,3.51,presentation 254 ounce can poured into a pint glass  look rich golden color small foamy head looks better than other comparable beers  smell grainy cereal like smell minor hops odor  taste grainy cereal taste to begin with and a bitter hops aftertaste the taste is distinct and enjoyable  feel mouth feel is decent smooth with a bit of a seltzer feel at the end  overall it is a respectable lager nothing remarkable about it but it has a distinct taste which sets it apart from other similarly priced beers id recommend this beer if youre on a budget but still want a flavorful lager
7,Foster's Lager,3.18,this was not a terrible lager it was reasonably dry without the corruption of sweeter cereal grains the body was well carbonated with the carbonation being very visible the grains that came in the initial lead to a clean dry finish on a hot day this would be exceptionally drinkable
8,Foster's Lager,3,pours out of the enormous can a crystal clear gold with an inch of head that dissipates quickly smells malty with a bit of sweetness taste follows the nose well with a good solid mouthfeel i was expecting a bad beer from my peers opinions about it but i actually kinda liked it
9,Foster's Lager,3.64,this beer is very delicious yeah its relatively cheap but its a very good tasting lager an a matter of fact its my favorite beer now it comes in a 25 oz can and its just a great lager not too hoppy and goes down good i recomend this to anyone who likes just a neutral tasting lager beer it gives you the buzz you want but the hangover isnt any worse than some of the others ive drank try it youll probably like itl
10,Foster's Lager,2.85,from a 750ml can hard to pour i guess youre just supposed to drink it out of the can clear golden color with white foamy head smells of light grain and straw light body earthy grain flavor basic macro lager nothing really stands out
11,Foster's Lager,3.21,poured from a can into a pint glass pours straw yellow orange with a fluffy white head smells of cereal grain not too strong but not too weak tastes of cereal grain beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation overall an average beer
12,Foster's Lager,3.54,fosters lager 5 abv pours golden with a 5finger white head that left great lacing nose is malty and sweet taste follows plus slight grain and bitterness decent mouthfeel overall very good be sure to say fosters with an australian accent
13,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.52,24oz can lets see what i did to myself  one the pour 1 finger of bubbly white head formed with surprisingly decent retention leaving a thick but sudsy ring and a slow dissipation to a thin covering on top body is a golden yellow as expected no lacing  aroma is bad like the cheapest oldest bottle of sutter home white wine in your local shitty liquor store its almost tart acetaldehyde for days and hints of vinegar  taste is of course an amplification of the aroma but even dirtier sweet shitty ros√© without the refreshing vibe that then transitions into a lightly malty finish with a dirty bitterness that thankfully doesnt grow the aftertaste is like wine puke  feel is at least drinkable but the knowledge of just how terribly made this is makes my body want to reject it the only way to drink this beer is to take big gulps but thay could lead to intestinal distress at least you can chug it without completely hating yourself at least completely  overall this is bad just buy steel reserve or at least go for the 122 alcohol version if you really need to get wasted and why the hell does this taste like what my palate in high school tasted dry white wine as but sweet  if you gotta drink it for gods sake dont pour it in a glass
14,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.58,camp 900 high gravity lager special reserve xxxxx 1050 abv  to its credit it hides its abv well the cloying sweetness is rough  f  avoid
15,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.11,really with this awful is the review i came up with
16,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,2.6,the first time i went to las vegas nv i was abruptly introduced to five different versions of camo malt liquor i purchased and consumed every single variety this review is based on a singular consumption of 900 high gravity
17,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.31,wow i stole a 24oz can of this out of a community motel fridge one nite just cuz i wanted a beer it was hot out and everything was closed wow that was a mistake horrible from the word go the carbonation wow that is awfull lot of alcohol but wow not good at all would rather not drink at all
18,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.96,mr can here there is some really deadly beer in cans and i will tell you about them yoi  i got a finger of rocky bonewhite head with decent retention color was a deep goldenyellow with nequality clarity nose had a fruity flavor hmm mouthfeel was medium with a fruity flavor finish was a cheap vinous flavor this was liquid crack not recommended for novices
19,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1,the top of my can says special reserve ok who are they kidding this is hands down a bottom of the barrel malt liquor i cracked my can and poured an 8 ounce glass full because i needed to see straight into the eye of the evil hidden behind that aluminum can pours a dark yellow color with a thick head and constant heavy carbonation the aroma is revolting the mouthfeel makes me a little woozy and the flavor is simply horrific overall this strong lager aka malt likka kikka is a tough sell for me because even if i was looking to get a quick drunk on this beer term used loosely is tough to drink be afraid be very afraid
20,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,2.51,since no day is a good day to subject myself to malt likkapalooza ix this day is as bad as any other for todays bout this big silver can of camo 900 will be going up against lucky number high gravity lager is it possible that camo 900 high gravity tastes different than camo high gravity camo silver ice and camo black ice only an idiot would do a 4way malt liquor comparison tasting hmmm  camo is urination yellow if the hobo is dehydrated with an offwhite lid that is by far the better looking of the two this stuff is actually beginning to deposit some lace on the upper reaches of the glass who put a good looking beer in my can of boozy malt liquor this might be the best looking beer of this style that ive ever seen  neither one of the aromas is overly offensive this one is sweet and corny with a semipleasant floral fruitiness that none of its typical imbibers is likely to appreciate no great shakes but doable given what style were dealing with  will wonders ever cease i didnt think very highly of camo silver ice for good reason but this stuff is drinkable if your expectations are in the correct place to start with the flavor is as simple as a stone and isnt as ahem pleasant as the nose but it aint bad either as always being ice cold helps  the bodymouthfeel is a bit lighter than the style average and has a just right amount of carbonation a soft fizziness hits and is then gone allowing the beer to melt in the mouth with a smoothness relatively speaking that is unusual in a malt liquor  either special reserve camo 900 high gravity lager really is better than camo silver ice or im in a malt liqorreceptive mood today scary thought anyway malt likkapalooza ix wasnt even close this stuff almost makes me want to go out and buy some brown paper bags
21,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,2.36,jeez this is a special reserve beer what is the reserve a bed in a poison control center  the pour from the ghetto sized 24 oz can gives you a brew best describes as first piss after the beer fest clear and yellow with a questionable white froth on top  smell is sweet corn and fruity ester funk that i normally smell in dogfish head beers matter of fact this smells exactly like dfh liquor de malt and i do see that i gave liquor de malt a 35 in smell so  taste is weirdly unflavored just some apples and alcohol burn near tasteless alcohol delivery device  mouthfeel is water plus vodka  drinkability is subjective there are far nastier malt liquors out there and i have tasted them this is meant for just two types of people hardcore alcoholics and college studentsmore or less the same thing in some places  unless you intend to stop going to work and become a wineo avoid
22,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,2,appears light pale golden hue bright white head leaves sporadic lacing aromatics contain sweet sugary fruit notes touch of honey and alcohol wow no real hop character residual sweetness evident corn and rice in harmonyharmonyharmonythats a naught by nature reference taste is upfront alcohol ridden along with sugary layers of mild fruit notes with corn and rice evident on the palate mouthfeel is mediumlight bodied slightly syrupy leaves streaks of flavor on the palate with each sip drinkability leaves me wanting something hoppier but the alcohol content is there what can i say were having fun sampling malt liquors
23,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.4,mine says camo 900 24 ounce can light yellow mildly aromatic with a bit of solvent and dirty fish tank along with grass light grains and alcohol the flavor is actually pretty unique but still rough corny and grainy there are only mild off flavors and this isnt quite as good as olde english 800
24,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.13,good god almighty a friend of mine bought me this as a gag poured a very pale orangeyyellow smell was of sulphur and rubber  it tasted of rubber and grain absolutely bad really bad  i dont know how anyone could stand to drink enough of this to get drunk i drank about 14 of it and then dumped the rest  wow should have passed the novelty on to someone else so i didnt have had to try it
25,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.57,pours a gold to light orange hue one finger head fades along with most of the carbonation in under a minute typical malt liquor apple cider smell taste is very sweet almost tangy low carbonation and no detectable hops leave this beer flat and unbalanced i guess the thick body and overly sweet flavor are worth struggling through if you aim to get smashed
26,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,2.07,camo 900 high gravity lager pours a classic lager amber from a 24 oz pop top can the light tan head went over two fingers before turning rocky then settling down to a fine carpet of foam leaving a fair amount of lace along the way plentiful streams of carbonation are rising to replenish the cap of foam in a seemingly endless supply  nose is a sweet corn with a floral component followed by the vapors of alcohol palate is a very sweet corn with some hops bittering not quite in balance with the very sweet corn the hops bittering offsets some but not all of the sweet corn missing is the burn from the 9 by volume alcohol it is tucked away in the same place as the bite of carbonation in the viscus liquid of this hgl the mouth feel is that of a light syrup  in the end the sweet corn becomes cloy the bitter has lost the battle and is nowhere to be found the sides of my glass are still covered in a fine lace a good deal of ambivalence is going on with the eye candy and the cloy sweet corn  for me its one time around the block for some one else im not so sure
27,Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,4.45,500 ml bottle into a snifter bottled 72021 had 31222  pours an opaque dark brown with a quarter inch quickly dissipating head and some spotty cling aromas of bourbon oak char malt chocolate some vanilla a little leather has a spicy peppery aroma flavors of bourbon oak malt vanilla chocolate raisins char a little licorice on the finish and in the aftertaste has a spicy taste somewhat black pepper like smooth a very good full body appropriately carbonated  really enjoyable lots of barrel and oak many distinct and expressive aromas and flavors not quite as full bodied for a bcs effort but its not a negative
28,Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,4.75,this beer pours a perfect onyx black with zero leakage on the edges and sports a dark tan head that is a bit creamy and sticks around for a surprising amount of time given the 16 abv a gorgeous representation of an imperial stout  the nose is boozy up front again no surprise with the high abv but theres also huge milk chocolate caramel vanilla oak and stone fruit as ripe dark cherries  notes that literally have me drooling theres a lot packed into this big beer  the taste has a nice boozy note up front that is not distracting at all and flows into the milk chocolate caramel vanilla oak and dark cherry flavors with a nice warming alcohol note at the back of the palate this is perfectly balanced and world class at the highest level imho  the mouthfeel is full substantial and coats the palate this is everything a ba imperial stout should be again imho
29,Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,4.39,opened my bottle of this with a friend of mine who had the elijah craig toasted barrel bourbon so we could try them side by side the beer pours much like any bcbs rich dark black color with a thin brown head on top the smell has a pretty healthy barrel presence to it some roast and chocolate in there too taste is solid nice chocolate mixed with bourbon and wood notes the feel was personally my favorite part of the beer it was smooth hardly any boozy heat the fact that it was 16 and drank so easily is very impressive overall its a great beer as it should be enjoyed having it
30,Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,4.9,152 really enjoyed this
31,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.06,oh lordy this is great pours dark darker than expected with a lovely effervescent rise of bubbles at the end dark malty brown almost dubbel cola dark aromas promising dark fruits rum and caramel maltier and less sweet taste than nose would suggest with teast and bready finish its complex and full of character man andechs rarely put a foot wrong
32,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.52,i had this on draft 42723  the beer temple  opaque brown appearance  nice khaki head minimal lace  burnt caramel honeyed grain mild cream  faint smoke notes in the nose  medium mouthfeel  burnt caramel honeyed grain  faint cream flavors  a classic
33,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.29,appearance pours a clear dark amber to deep brown color with a moderate light tan head srm of 1820 400  aroma strong aromas of brown bread caramel some hints of dark fruit of raisin plum grape 425  flavor strong flavors of caramel brown bread some hints of dark fruit with some dark grains yeasty and bready off the end 425  feel mediumbodied strong carbonation toasted mildly sweet finish 425  compared to weihenstephaner korbinian 3152023 pours lighter similar head stronger aromas more brown bread toasted grains less dark fruit and syrup less cocoa slightly more carbonation and yeastier  overall an excellent doppelbock here as expected complex strong and bready flavors that lean a bit toasted nice german yeast give a clean and dry finish that is what makes this better than every other doppelbock ive tried sidebyside this is the best rating 429
34,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.24,cherry brown with a steady puffy tan cap of froth fresh baked bread red currants pretzels and raisinettes dark bread crust red plums brown sugar carob bark and a vague herbal ending fizzy medium dead smooth  4 425 425 425 425  all the right moves lest it be taken for granted it is burnfree attenuated silky  all of the things youd expect from german precision brewing if im forced to find fault its a bit undercarbed which makes it play a touch sweeter than it should also surprised and delighted by all the fruit  i cant help thinking that this brings many of the notes that make baltic porter great but in a much more drinkable package that makes this even less bready and more estery than korbinian id love to drink the two side by side very digestif it just slides right down but ill love to pair it with duck or pork chops  proper wintery treat deserves many revisits
35,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.67,i have been to the monastery in kloster twice and had this beer fresh from the tap it has a deep amber color and flavorful aroma its is powerful tasting but not so much as some other german doppelbachs definitely tastes of caramel and very smooth almost as good out of the bottle but i cant think of any beer that is as good out of a bottle than fresh from the tap this is probably my 1 doppelbach
36,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.25,pours a dark brown with a fizzy head the aroma and taste are all malt and caramel that deep burnt caramel that is the hallmark of this style and makes it not exactly my favorite it is well in line with the other examples ive had and is very flavorful and clean medium sweetness and bitterness medium mouthfeel as well
37,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.74,outstanding so smooth and delicious for 71 that 71 is packed with rich flavors to its all balanced out right perfect beer imo 1 of my favorite beers i recommend it
38,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.58,grabbed a 05l bottle at the local liquor store type place benz in sindelfingen these quality beers are so cheap been a long time since ive had this style and its been an even longer time that ive wanted to try one of this quality very strong aroma almost barrel like and drinks quite strong for the abv super strong malt character with plenty of sweetness and roasted finish very clean and delicious
39,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,5,2013 at toronado in 2014
40,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.56,received a bottle in a trade 12622 2021 bottling date consumed 61523 abv is 133  beer poured black with a pretty nice tan head that dissipated quickly  nose is very nice with roasted malts dominating and giving notes of bourbon vanilla and dark fruit  taste is awesome large heavy roasted malt base gives a touch of boozy heat with notes of vanilla and dark fruit lingering in the background finishes perfectly balanced with the heavy roast and barrels the large malt base  mouthfeel is full bodied chewy and smooth  overall an amazing brew with a very nice price point
41,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.5,2021 vintage love the boxed presentation as always popped the top poured down the center of a fw snifter deep dark xlnt beige foam that laced down with each sip tequila barrel right up front then chocolate a bit of pepper light molasses quite aromatic taste is chocolaty at first then piloncillo vanilla good alcohol burn on the tongue the tequilla barrel leaves a quick impression then brandy and bourbon bring it all together great long finish not overly sweet full mouthfeel medium carb overall another winner from firestone walkers incredible barrel program
42,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.5,2021 version tasted on tap at the propagator may 15 2022 subtle tequila on the nose creamy andjust excellent
43,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.59,appearance arrives fudge colored with a beige head that settles in as a film but leaves plenty of lacing  smell the tequila barrel aromatics dominate but there are lots of complementary aromatics of chocolate spice cake bourbon and brandy  taste dark chocolate foward with hints of spice cake brown sugar and vanilla through the middle the barrel tones emerge with tequila leading but the bourbon and brandy also in the mix the finish brings all the flavors together with a slightly boozy edge  mouthfeel full bodied with moderate carbonation some warmth in the gullet  overall firestone walkers barrel program is unsurpassed and this is a great example of their creativity
44,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,5,providentially just got a 4pack shipped in  pardon my lessrefined lack of nuance but it this batch was just as welcomelyreceived as any parabola or its variants  wow looks like quite the internationallysourced list of ingredients and influences doubly longinglounging to revisit orval about now  mighty hit of the flat opaque thick boozy malty salty sweet complex and woodburnished got 2 left for a real milestone should i live so long  one to grab
45,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.63,alright alright alright cue the matthew mcconaughey grin  best smoked beer ive ever had balanced but still gives you a nice kachow in the kisser with that smoke bomb drinkable af but notable and memorable  im not a huge smoke beer person and about 12 way through a pour im usually pawning it off on the nearest buddybut ive ordered this a few times now and drank every bit  definitely worth the try even if its prying you out of your safety zone not trying it if youre able should make you reevaluate your life and wonder if youre having a failure to launch bud dum bum pshhhmatt joke
46,Choklat,4.05,650 ml bottle courtesy of cardinal pub  bar stavanger abv is 110 pitch black colour moderate creamy tan head intense aroma of cocoa  chocolate the flavour has also loads of chocolate and cocoa but the sweetness is not too extreme also some roasted coffee notes a moderate hoppy bitterness in the finish chinook and willamette balances some of the chocolate sweetness very drinkable for an 11 beer i had no problem finishing the bottle  but if you hate chocolate this is clearly not a beer for you
47,Choklat,4.44,ive had many opportunities to drink choklat oranj and really liked it had this one for a few years and thought a snowy christmas would be a good time to drink it really hits the spot i guess it could be a dessert beer but when its freezing outside and the snow is blowing itll do looks like motor oil with very little head just like an imperial stout should with my diminished sense of smell i get chocolate imagine that and malt cant decide if its milk chocolate bittersweet or what but definitely chocolate taste is the star here chocolate of course but i dont think its too sweet nice clean finish i could drink it for dessert but its fine in front of the fire in the dead of winter mouthfeel is almost perfect slightly thick smooth as silk and just about right overall a really good imperial stout unfortunately it doesnt seem to be available any longer but should it pop up again im definitely getting another bottle or two
48,Choklat,4.25,22oz bottle no dating information found black colored body with ruby back lit highlights two fingers of tan head settles back to bubbly cap leaves very little lacing aroma is similar to a chocolate malt smells very sweet taste is sweet but also bittersweet and with a little smoky char displays many types of chocolate from sweet milk chocolate to bitter dark chocolate roasted malts are there for support mouth feel is about medium but the texture is more rich and with slight syrup good carbonation this is a beer made to display many forms and textures of chocolate fudge to syrup to milk chocolate balls to bittersweet ultimately sweet and best suited for a dessert experience
49,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,4.32,i liked it buy more
50,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.94,sam adams octoberfest m√§rzen 53 abv pours clearish brown with a halffinger offwhite head nose is malty and bready taste follows slightly sweet equally bitter a bit overcarbonated overall very good
51,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.16,i so wanted to enjoy this beer its a personal preference but i was turned off by the roasted malt flavor
52,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,4.11,a malty rendition of the marzen oktoberfest style slightly sweeter than the rest of this field which is fine by me samuel adams might be one of the larger breweries but they do a good job with crafting this one
53,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,5,beautiful dark amber color wunderbar aroma very sweet and delicious  style m√§rzen  tapcanbottle bottle  abv 53  rating 5
54,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.07,12oz bottle pours a clear light amberorange color with a dense and thick tancolored head that fades down at a moderate rate before disappearing smells of toasted malts and bread taste is the standard caramel toasted malts hearty bread notes slight sweetness and some grassy hop flavor but the flavor seems to disappear into a watery finish surprisingly fast small hop bitterness that closes the beer and forms most of the aftertaste medium body with a moderate carbonation mouthfeel and that outofplace watery feel  this would have been a fairly solid m√§rzen but that watery feeling really holds it back wont buy again
55,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.3,sam adams used to make a good oktoberfest beer which is not hard to do the marzen style is pretty easy to nail unfortunately it appears that theyve watered down their marzen just as they watered down their boston lager recently its still a very drinkable beer and would be rated much higher as a pils or a dark lager but there is virtually no hint of the marzen style in this beer
56,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.6,its kind of disappointing that sam adams cannot put together a better octoberfest than this  mine was from a bottle poured flat smelled pretty decent and certainly tastes like a fast beer  sam adams is sponsoring the cincinnati octoberfest the second largest in the world they can do better
57,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.77,when i start seeing sa octoberfest in the shelves i know fall is just around the corner good goto beer for the autumn easy to find reasonably priced great fall session crushable beer wont blow your mind but will satisfy you
58,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.28,been in the mood for some oktoberfest beer sam adams is okay not great but okay like alot of craft beer it seems to me they all pretty much taste like they were made with among other things charcoal as one of the ingredients tears up my stomach country boy oktoberfest is the best ive sampled thus far but my goodness a 6pack of 12ounce cans is 14 too damn expensive why the hell craft breweries think they can charge so damn much is beyond me the sam adams was 11 for a 6pack ridiculous
59,Pirate Bomb!,4.15,black in color with no penetration to light theres a fingernail of brown around the rim and and covering a third of the top the aroma is of chilies rum and coffee im tasting chilies vanilla cacao and rum the mouth is warm from the chilies and otherwise chewy
60,Pirate Bomb!,3.61,12 oz bottle marked 072719 sampled 050921 a little long to wait bought it off the shelf 3 weeks ago so the brewer takes any hits on aging they left it there for purchase  appearance black glass thin halo of tan bubbles no lacing  aroma heavy vegetative chili note burned barrel some underlying malt sweetness  taste medicinal alcohol green pepper some sweetness comes in deep into the taste a little coffee in the finish hard to get many beer flavors out of this even imperial stout flavors some pepper burn long after the swallow that builds a bit  mouthfeel medium heavy body low almost flat carbonation little oily in the finish but pretty clean  overall i love prairie bombs ive enjoyed a lot of the variations this one not so much i think all the additions overwhelm the yummy base beer and it just comes across as a little gimmicky the vegetable note really throws me maybe this one sat too long the date code is all but invisible on the bottle
61,Pirate Bomb!,4.99,fantastic the rum taste really comes thru
62,Pirate Bomb!,4.44,on tap at cardinal pub  bar stavanger pitch black colour low tan head aroma first of fusel alcohols then molasses rum oak cask vanilla coconut chocolate and roast malts rich and warming mouthfeel outstanding flavour medium sweet and roasty no sign of fusel otherwise all the delicious notes from the aroma are repeated and strengthened here nice chili heat in the finish perfect
63,Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,3.71,i like some head on my beers and this one only produced a thin ring of foam around the edge sticky looking syrup like lace on the glass chocolate is dominate both on the nose and the pallet bitter chocolate give it a touch of harshness not a bad stout just far from being one of my go to brews
64,Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,4.09,115oz bottle into a pint glass bottled 12212015 so 7 years old  mixed look here jet black body but barely any head  enticing aroma though dark fruit molasses think ris light  on tasting vanilla wafts in and out of a slightly sweet dark fruit flavor some mild bitter dark chocolate  mouth medium thinner than would be preferred finish a lasting mild roast  overall ages nicely would be interesting to compare with a fresh bottle
65,Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,4.21,12 ounce bottle aged in a stout glass  opaque black with a shallow dark tan cap a ring wave and dots of lacing  lots of aromas vanilla sweet and dark chocolate roasted malt dark fruits brown sugar  vanilla dark chocolate roasted malt and cocoa flavors  medium body low carbonation leans sweet  went well after dinner with some dark chocolate and mexican chocolate cookie
66,Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,3.8,341 ml bottle from a quebecois coworker abv is 65 black colour low tan head strong and pleasant aroma of cocoa and vanilla the flavour is not very sweet but has plenty of cocoa powder and vanilla with strong coffee and bittering hops in the finish no aphrodisiaque effect detected  maybe i am immune
67,Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,4.15,this is my new favourite stout among those that i can buy in my region at 14 for 4 bottles its so much better than i would have expected the look is pretty standard for a 7 ish abv stout dark black with brownish head that leaves a small amount of lacing the smell on this beer is great i didnt have a bottle opener when i tried it for the first time so i had to whack it on the counter and when some spilled there was this huge rush of vanilla chocolate and beautiful malt the taste does not quite follow the nose the complex profile on the nose is lessened significantly when tasting it is still very cool and the added flavours of vanilla and chocolate are done well enough the vanilla comes up front but is subtle and the sweetness is balanced well by the roasted malt the chocolate follows into the aftertaste and is again balanced well by the bitter coffee notes of the roasted malt the mouthfeel is pretty good mediumfull bodied with mediumlow carbonation maybe a little more carbonation would be nice but i like it overall i used
68,Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,3.92,appearance almost black brown smell malt port coffee taste coffee vanilla chocolate dark dry fruits malt mouthfeel low carbonation overall a tasty stout with pronounced flavours that complement each other well
69,Bourbon County Brand Stout,5,goose island bourbon county imperial stout  now i must say this is quite quite good like very good somewhere between a good stout and an aged whiskey which isnt a surprise based on the drink itself that being said it does not exemplify the thing i like most about beer so far being drinkability i do like the refreshing nature of a beer quite a bit and that is the only thing id say is absent here  at 143 percent its quite high for a beer and you feel a lingering alcohol taste towards the end it is accompanied by some sweet notes like date and chocolate though  mouthfeel is very unique in that somehow the bubbles feel thick like the consistency is buttery and but the bubbles feel heavy for some reason bringing out a very odd and unique but not off putting almost soupy texture mouthfeel end notes are sticky and also a little velvety or caramellike  smell is a little sour and very malt forward slightly fruity and even slightlyer herby  if you havent tried it i highly recommend ive been sipping as i write this and am appreciating it more and more one hell of a beer if you do grab one the only thing i can say is that its not smashable but should be enjoyed slowly
70,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.86,finally getting to try this 2022 vintage poured from bottle into a snifter  look blackbrownred thick oily very thin light brown head no retention except a tiny ring  smell oh wow damn this is pulling no punches chocolate coffee caramel malt bourbon dark bread and the tiniest hints of vanilla beans raisins and bananas incredibly complex  taste yuuuuup heavyweight but incredibly smooth at the same time lots of the chocolate with the vanilla bean and caramel notes playing second and third fiddle heavy maltiness and bourbon character but still incredibly smooth with very little burn for the abv raisin note is slightly present in the back as well as the faintest banana peeking through once the malt onslaught begins to fade  feel thick but only slightly oily on the palette light but lingering carbonation sticks around a bit but in a pleasant way and doesnt overstay its welcome very slightly syrupy really pleasant  overall masterclass of an imperial stout has more distinct flavour impressions than most stouts with adjuncts but is still perfectly balanced deserves the hype
71,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.45,opened the 2019 bottle that has been aging in my cellar poured into a tulip glass the chocolate colored head quickly dissipated midnight color smell was extraordinary complex consisting of a beautiful bouquet of chocolate alcohol fine whiskey and espresso taste was exceedingly complex the stout lingered on my palate forever it seemed take your time to sip this beauty as it has a high alcohol content overall a warm stout to enjoy in the midst of a winter storm near a fireplace well done
72,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.65,2022  a pours a beautiful black oily color perfectly opaque hardly any head  swow rich chocolate plums oakespresso a bit of whiskey probably the best smelling beer ive had the pleasure of smelling  tchocolate bourbon oaky goodness raisins coffee cant believe this is 145 percent abv  m rich and oily  o its incredible it lives up to the hype
73,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.91,pours a deep brown nearly black  the smell is very reminiscent of whiskey due to the barrel aging slight alcohol tinge but very fruity and sweet smelling the smell is like raisins or figs there is a slight fermentation flavor that reminds me of wine likely due to the high abv  the flavor is very sweet and low in bitterness the flavor is extremely malty and fruity the taste seems like a cross between a high malt beer a wine and a bourbon notes of figs raisins trailed by syruppy molasses and fermentation flavors  the mouthfeel is thick and syrupy  a very excellent beer
74,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.75,this is my favorite stout beer since i live in the chicago area its easily accessible i see some reviews that state kbs is as good or better im writing this review to say that is false
75,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.75,pours very dark dark tan foam heavy bourbon aroma big flavors chocolate caramel and oak very complex but well balanced strong alcohol finish beyond excellent best imperial stout ive ever had
76,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.83,look pours obsidian black with a very light coppercolored head  smell strong whiskey and vanilla aromas along with fudge and coffee  taste silky smooth bourbon and vanilla taste im also getting the hints of chocolate and coffee and there is also some caramel going on as well the oak is present as it goes down and just finished the taste perfectly  feel man this is too smooth for how heavy it is the feel is heavy but this is easily drinkable and just paints the palette with a velvety finish  overall absolute dynamite for the style this is one of the best out there and lives up to the hype
77,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.63,given to me as the bottle itself from a friend of mine poured into a snifter  l  pitch black with a onefinger tan head head goes away after a few minutes or so fantastic lacing s  frenchroast coffee with chicory heavy notes of bourbon oak and dark chocolate hint of black cavendish pipe tobacco t  follows nose rich burnt sugar halfway through the glass this brew evolves into a something else notes of vanilla cacao frenchroast coffee and chewy caramel hinting at fig cherry and raisin finish is longacquired leaning sweet with a velvety oaken tobacco f  fullbodied with little carbonation viscous but not syrupy velvety dense strong this one is a sipper for sure and itll warm you up o  another fantastic brew from goose island while i wouldnt say its worth the price in the slightest it is a musttry funny enough the abv isnt detectable i didnt realize how strong it was until i peeked at the label halfway through the glass a delightful  decadent end to a chilly evening highly recommend but i probably wont get it again
78,Skol,2.06,bought at a supermarket in algorta spain  pours translucid yellow colour slim foam head almost no smell very very light taste bitter after taste  dull beer
79,Skol,1.72,carbonataci√≥n media cuerpo extremadamente ligero una cerveza acuosa dulce casi sin rastros de amargor ser√≠a como la cerveza corona pero de brasil
80,Skol,2.35,from festival de las naciones in teku glass playing the last door season 2 the closest thing to water ive ever found in a beer can no aroma no taste no aftertastewatery at least hasnt anything unpleasant either
81,Skol,2.64,i had this beer at the airport in sao paulo from a can the beer is a light americanstyle lager smells of corn a bit of grass lightly sweet and grainy not as dry as many of the style but not very interesting simple straightforward and uninteresting
82,Hercules Double IPA,4.17,clear golden hued body dense slow rising carbonation thick white head long lasting semicreamy texture initial scent of floral and tropical fruit notes mild spicy zestiness very faint earthy maltiness very mild cereal grain flavor carrying a zesty spicy hop flavor white pepper sage and turmeric moderate bitterness very quiet alcohol presence mediumheavy mouthfeel smooth and lightly velvety bold alcohol warmth presence semidry at the finish  i know ive had this beer before likely before my beeradvocate days regardless this is my first rating and review of this beer it is a solid easy drinking imperial india pale ale simple yet alluring  pouring temperature 46 f canning info 51123 source local purchase
83,Hercules Double IPA,4.15,12 ounce bottle into a great divide snifter clear liquid gold and a nice fluffy foam from an aggressive pour smells like colorado the dank pine jumps right out theres a sweetness on the nose from the malt tastes big a punch in the mouth of well balanced maltiness and stanky piney hops resiny crisp finish featuring a bitter hop note high medium to low heavy mouthfeel medium carbonation overall id drink these every gah dam day if they were sold in florida
84,Hercules Double IPA,4.5,looks almost crystal clear def not hazy def my style  smells like pot i cant smoke it but i sure like the smell and beer taste of it  tastes super dank super weedy sweet and caramely with a sticky sticky resinous piney darkness old school as fuck and super big on malt and hops  feel is oily and gelatinous finishes very crisp though intriguing beer  overall  ive definitely had this before but i always seems to ignore great divide for whatever reason i think im primarily annoyed by their yeti series and how they absolutely try to milk the fuck out off it but thats another topic regardless its been a long time since ive bought a gd beer probably close to ten years but this beer is a super nice reminder of where beer was at 1015 years ago very dfh 90 minuteesque as well an ipa not ashamed to be malty and unpalatable to virginia beer enthusiasts
85,Hercules Double IPA,3.94,pine pine pine bitter bitter bitter bready bready  very old school not hoppy
86,Hercules Double IPA,4,citrus hints and malt dominates this dipa and the hops come in the form of deep woods pine forest other more nondescription tropical fruits appear as this warms youll hear others say this really comes to life as it warms i agree tasty stuff big pine notes with plenty of sweet nutty tealike malts without the sweetness being a turnoff like many also note the hops dont dominate here
87,Hercules Double IPA,3.32,the can i have isnt expired but not the freshest but this is so malty im wondering if they some how canned a brown ale if this how this normally is then its honestly awful to me zero hops just malt like this is so disappointing ill have to try again to see   seeing as how i have the lowest review on here i looked at others and theyre all as flabbergasted as i am i really hope we all got bad bottles or cans and it will be better next time   update after trying again i more or less confirmed what i thought while also liking this more still not for me but for those more into malty ipas
88,Hercules Double IPA,3.61,rerate 355 ml bottle courtesy of cardinal pub  bar stavanger abv is 91 85 ibu orange to amber colour slightly hazy moderate but lasting offwhite head with an orangey hue pleasant aroma of fruity american hops the flavour is an aggressive hoppy explosion from start to finish on a malty sweet too sweet background very bitter aftertaste not for the faint of heart  but i might get used to this  im upping it a point original rating bottle at the rover g√∂teborg amber colour hazy sweet and alcoholic aroma and flavour but also plenty of hops as expected from a double ipa a bit overdone on both sweetness and hops in my book but still a good beer
89,Nillerzzzzz,4.44,look  black and thick with a fantastic tan rimming and lacing smell and taste  so much barrel booze chocolate and vanilla in that order feel  thick and creamy with a light carb overall  pretty fantastic for being from 2018 and drinking in 2023
90,Beer 30 Light,1,bought this when in college for a party tasted of sour wine body odor and skunked beer  there was beer left in the fridge at the end of the party if already inebriated college kids wont drink it i dont know how it could ever be considered worth paying any amount of money for it
91,Beer 30 Light,3,dude this is a light beer and the cheapest one do since all light beer tastes the same this should be the most popular one it was about 1213 years ago because thats when the 08 recession hit and i closed shortly after i sold it for 1 a can we started calling it millionaire beer cause everyone pretended they were rich buying rounds for everyone
92,Beer 30 Light,1,have only thrown up once due to alcohol in my life and this beer was the culprit stinks of urine tastes like urine stirred with sweaty gym socks and leaves the heaviest nastiest hangover you will ever suffer from avoid this beer at all costs the worst excuse for an alcoholic beverage i have ever had the misfortune to imbibe
93,Beer 30 Light,1.44,not as good as beer 30 ice not got at all actually
94,Beer 30 Light,1,i usually would never give any beer this low a score but it is the beer i will always remember not for good reason i was in college and consistently drank terrible beer weekly the usually adjunct lagers and even worse this beer was unpalatable for me even when i drank bmc beers on the reg and thought they were good a couple friends and i pick it up for a game of beer pong in college and left it sitting in the corner of the garage it was awful try it just to say youve had the worst beer ever made
95,Beer 30 Light,1,i busted a party with some kids and they were drinking this stuff smelled like old garbage and farts one kid said they paid 8 for a 30 pack thats cheaper than natty light they were underage so i had them pour it out  came back to that same house a week later for another underage party and the grass was dead in the spot they poured out last weeks batch id avoid this swill
96,Baltic Porter,4.68,l reminds me of a imperial stout thick dark black dense  s chocolate coffee sweet vanilla  t follows the nose  f medium to full vey low carbonation quickly fading to a stillness  o an excellent example of a baltic porter
97,Baltic Porter,4.03,355 ml botlle from vinmonopolet nettbutikken black colour large tan head aroma of roast malts coffee prunes raisins and chocolate soft mouthfeel medium sweet flavour with the same elements as the aroma fairly low bitterness enjoyable
98,Baltic Porter,2.8,2013 vintage drank 2615  yuss haus  dark brown appearance  dark tan head minimal lace  tart cherry  mild booze heat nose  medium thick creamy mouthfeel  bakers chocolate  cream of wheat flavors up front pickle juice  mild booze heat on the finish  sadly as this warmed the pickle juice took over not very good
99,Baltic Porter,4.28,bottle conditioned  may 2015  pours pitch black and oily thin tan head dissipates steadily leaving just a thin ring of mocha colored foam along the outside of the beer beer appears thick and viscous when poured  aroma has notes of cocoa dark fruits roasted malts and molasses very nice aroma albeit somewhat subdued  however that is to be expected given the age of this bottle  taste is quite smoky with notes of roasted and smoked malts molasses chocolate and dark fruits incredibly complex array of flavors not a ton of hops here but again not unexpected given the age of this bottle the smokiness here really is quite lovely no bitterness is left on the finish  feel is thick with a nice heft to it semidry finish light vibrant carbonation  overall this is a lovely beer and the age on this has done nothing but wonders
100,Baltic Porter,3.52,a bit overrated by other reviewers a solid stout all around but not exceptional like a sam smiths
101,Baltic Porter,4.35,12oz bottle marked bottle conditioned mar 2015 abv 9 poured into a smuttynose pint glass at fridge temp the beer pours very dense dark brown with a little bit of light brown head the head recedes to a paper thin coating with a sheet of lacing working down the glass as consumed the aroma is dark charred malt and a little bakers dark chocolate the taste is roasty malts up front then a little tangy flavor  maybe a little dark fruit finishing with a big semisweet chocolate finale mouthfeel is medium to full bodied well carbonated with a wet yet uncloying finish overall very good i had cellered this bottle since 2015 and it makes me sad this is not available locally anymore recommended
102,Baltic Porter,4.01,l  for a porter pours a very dark brown with a twofinger light brown head produced with aerated pour minimal retention and some lacing s  molasses barley malts bakers chocolate stonefruits and a touch of smoke and bacon t  leads with a good amount of dark chocolate wellroasted barley malts and smoke followed by hints of dark roast coffee molasses and candied prune f  moderately thick silky mouthfeel medium carb restrained bitterness on the finish o  reminds me a lot of smuttys robust porter although a little more intense somewhat surprised that this is currently beeradvocates highest rated beer in new hampshire since its pretty nondescript overall although still well put together  81100
103,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.66,from the bottle it pours a clear light yellow color with a modest white head that eventually diminishes to a nice ring some spotty lacing the nose gets grassy notes not overly pleasant the mouth gets a light grainy malt flavor
104,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,1.56,dec 2010 250 ml bottle as buckler 00 brewed by heineken spain deep golden to pale brown colour moderate white head typical na beer aroma of unhopped wort and cooked vegetables grainy flavour notes of wort maize and overcooked vegetables
105,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.53,i had this beer at a friends house this evening he drinks low alcohol beer because he claims regular beer puts him to sleep this beer may also put you to sleep because it is boring  pours a clear yellow color with brief white head and light lacing smell and taste was grassy corny tasted kind of like flat old lager light watery feel not something i would drink again except out of politeness
106,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.72,pours a light foamy 1 finger head with moderate retention fair soapy lacing crystal clear light pale slight watery color  nose some malt syrup sorghum thing a bit of cereal light floral hop  taste more malt water with light malt syrup sorghum thing hint cereal touch of herbal hop a bit of corn drier gritty finish a mild bitterness  mouth is lighter bod med carb  overall eh not terrible but not good not much going on and quite plane even for na beer likely before the craft na beer movement started
107,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,4.19,12 oz bottle best by dec2021 purchased single off shelf poured into a 14 oz mug  l polishedclear brassygold liquid some flecks of sediment tall tight silken foam stand the foam holds at first then breaks up after the first sip leaves a solid ring of lace at the top while keeping a collar till the end  s mineral herbalgrassy hop hint of peppery phenol rather freshbaked bready underlying foundation great expression and intensity overall  t pretzels and lemon peel dry finish with a moderate pepperyherbal bitterness which lingers long aftertaste is quite dry with a toasty pretzel bready essence quietly humming  f cut dry tight flow seems like theres a dextrin plumpness to its body up front but it just drops in the finish  o i would not be disappointed if i had to drink this often it lacks the bubblegum and clove flourishes ive tasted in other dutch and german nas not bad 1746
108,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,1.98,well for a low alcohol beer it drinks and tastes like a bud light good on a hot day or to go with tacos otherwise not much to write home about
109,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.7,12oz bottle poured into a pint  a pours a clear golden color with a onefinger foamy white head that reduces to a ring around the edge  s smells of skunk toasted cereal grains a hint of spicy hops smells like sugar smacks cereal  t slightly sweet malt up front gives notes of toasted grains and puffed wheat cereal midpalate gives notes of cardboard and light skunk the finish gives just a trace of spicy hops  m light body with moderate carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel and a crisp dry finish  o pretty well balanced some offputting notes but drinkable
110,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,3.08,a  light gold color with good head retention on top  s  aroma is very light pale malt aroma with just a little bit of hop spiciness  t  grain flavor with a little bit of spiciness on the back end bitterness is low and the finish is balanced  m  light medium body with gentle prickly carbonation that gives way to a soft texture  o  for a nonalcoholic beer its better than i expected for what it is it hits the mark would i buy more to be determined better than the current score of 257 definitely
111,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.98,clear golden bottle pour with minimal foam and light aroma of grassy hops the flavor is thin but pleasant enough for the style the finish lacks dryness which would improve the appeal
112,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,3,from the 12 fl oz bottle with as mar2020 best by date sampled on june 17 2019  the appearance is a clear golden color with a fizzy white head the dissipates quickly great clarity  barley grains and all spice greet the nose with a hint of floral notes and an overall cleanliness  the mouthfeel is thin watery and that is to be expected for a na beer in my opinion  there is a sort of nutmeggy barley grain taste and slightly sweet clean crisp finish its a na beer i could have more than once if i am trying to avoid alcohol
113,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.57,good news is this isnt as bitter as other nas out there but this also means not as much flavour during the summertime i can see how this would be a light refreshing treat for the other seasons though i may opt for a heartier cooked brew
114,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.65,had next to the new heineken zero alcohol and the coors non alcoholic and this was better than the coors and much worse than the heineken more malty and sweet at the end but unlike the coors its a reasonable facsimile to real beer if i let it be i never drink this kind of thing but i think this one is better than many it has actual flavor at resembles beer and that alone makes it decent in its field clear and yellowish and thin but it holds its head really well and looks enough like a light lager some corny sweetness to it even an appreciable yeast aspect its a shame they missed out on any hops because that seems like the easiest of the core ingredients to assimilate into a non alcoholic brew it should at least have a balancing element because without it the beer finishes sugary and one dimensional seems like a missed opportunity to me very light body even with the sweetness a sort of stale and metallic layer too though high carbonation saves it for me i would choose this over many of its peers but now that they have the new heineken alcohol free beer this one may take a hit
115,Memoria,4.47,poured from a growler  pours a perfectly clear very pale gold color there is a good three to four finger head on the beer as its poured but that dissipates pretty quickly no real residual head remains just some blotchy foam aroma is lovely  its got that rich doughy bready malt that only the best helles lagers have there is a touch of honey and sweet bread along with some fleeting whiffs of grass  taste is a bit unexpected so there is that rich bready doughy character along with some sweet bread the first unexpected character comes from this strong oaky character this clearly comes from the oak puncheon it spends time in i just am kind of surprised at how much of that oaky character remains in the beer now the next surprise is the finish on this the flavor is kind of mild  dried grass and a slight hint of herbal notes from the hops but there is a stronger bitterness that lingers beyond the finish the overall profile is not necessarily a traditional helles lager but it does taste delicious feel is medium bodied doughy and smooth carbonation is gentle smooth and lightly prickly trends a bit dry on the finish  overall its a lovely helles lager even if it is not strictly traditional delicious and a joy to drink
116,Memoria,4.36,lightly foggy burnt straw yellow and like autumna before it with a thick level white head leaving beautiful layers of lace after sipping through the persistent blanket  light corns present as a little toasty and while less bitter than autumna its still in the same vein and just absolutely bone dry over time floral qualities develop both that and the dryness keep it from expressing any sweetness as well as what seems may be mild oak tannins
117,Memoria,4.43,poured on draft at the brewery  pours a cloudy pale gold color with a large creamy white head great retention and lacing as always  aromas of honey and fresh biscuits as well as grassy floral hops theres a faint oak character throughout very nice  the flavor follows the nose lots of sweet biscuits and honey balanced by grass and hops and a bit of earthy oak  the feel is mediumlight bodied with good carbonation crisp and drinkable yet creamy and smooth with a dryish finish  overall this is definitely one of the best lagers ive ever had maybe its because its on draft at the source and hf beer just hits different on draft but this is such an amazing beer that i hope to try again
118,Memoria,4.25,good helles lager  solid beer
119,Memoria,5,absolutely amazing helles lager poured on tap at hf
120,Memoria,4.61,on tap at hf  thick creamy white head with lace clear straw yellow  one of the best helles ive had so smooth and soft earthy but creamy biscuit and toasted crackers grassy hops faint bitterness light bodied so incredibly drinkable
121,Oude Geuze Cuv√©e Armand & Gaston,4.59,the beer pours a very bubbly white head that dissipates very quickly the beer itself is a clear brownish orange color that looks nice  the smell is very good it has an orange note upfront with a bit of funk and oak underneath it  the taste is delicious it has a strong orange note with a light funk and light toffee finish there is a light oak note to it  the feel is very good the beer has a light body to it but a good texture so that it doesnt feel thin it has a tingling sensation the acidity is really nice its very similar to that of orange juice not taxing for the average person  overall a fantastic gueuze thats perfect for the hot weather to drink or to have something during the day it isnt overly taxing on the palate
122,Oude Geuze Cuv√©e Armand & Gaston,4.39,blend no 77 season 1718 bottled 21 sep 18 based on the best before date this is 20180921 corked and caged 750ml bottle  clear golden orange fizzy low head smells funky and bright dirt floor plus flower tastes wow so much going on crisp acidity plus funk some overripe fruit flavors coming in waves feel is outstanding  light and tingly but lasting on the tongue really good stuff
123,Oude Geuze Cuv√©e Armand & Gaston,4.23,375 ml bottle  season 1718 blend no 80  poured a slightly cloudy orange golden in color with offwhite colored head pretty good head retention aroma and flavor a nice blend of sharp fruity tartness and dry oak tannins and a little funk nice complexity medium bodied average carbonation
124,Oude Geuze Cuv√©e Armand & Gaston,4.49,bottled in 2018 drank from a teku glass a most excellent geuze complex flavors with a hint of clove and some good sourness but not too much very drinkable and refreshing despite its great body and complexity i will try to find another bottle and let it age longer
125,Oude Geuze Cuv√©e Armand & Gaston,4.5,blend no 57  season 1617  wort from 9 different brews aged in 8 different barrels  bottled november 14th 2017  enjoyed on december 31 2022 poured from a cagedandcorked 750ml bottle into my drie de fonteinen tumbler  not quite clear amber body with an active champagne fist receding to a small fine cap vague sloppy lacing no legs very good retention  subtle yet complex aroma  herbaceous and floral with a delicate funk bringing to mind superior washed rind cheese  palate entry brings to mind alfalfa fields sorrel and salty sea breezes tart but not bracingly so low earthy bitterness comes and goes goat milk lanolin crisp malt and raw nuts finishes dry with earth minerality umami and a hint of funk  mediumlight bodied well carbonated nearly refreshing but still soft  hard to find a more authentic example of the style  rich complex rustic yet refined reasonable value given the time and labor involved a good candidate for aging indefinitely
126,Oude Geuze Cuv√©e Armand & Gaston,4.75,pours a rich light orange with ample visible carbonation and a light collar of foam nose is extremely funky and expressive with elements of dried and wet hay fresh cut crash menthol wood chips pine and sap the aroma continually evolves and builds on itself throughout the course of the drink taste follows with an equal complexity and expresses many of those notes from the nose theres a deep earthiness that underlies it as well evocative at one moment of the smells of a forest floor or the flavor of a cave aged cheese the next overall this beer does not stop working until its gone remarkable and easily one of the best
127,Miller Lite,3.01,theres a time and place for this not the best beer in the miller stable you already know how to feel about this pretty slim taste good cookout beer and a great one more beer not special but not toilet water either just lite beer nothing more the best of its kind in a way
128,Miller Lite,3,i cant believe im actually reviewing a light beer lol i expected to review a yuengling light or a modelo oro before this one anyways its miller lite it tastes better than coors light and bud light which ive known for years it tastes like a nerfed version of miller high life which isnt a bad thing if youre trying to lose your spare tire it pretends to identify as a pilsner on the label while being an american adjunct lager i guess some guy on the marketing team heard the word pilsner back in 1942 and slapped it on can if i ever fully transition to 4 beers miller lite would be a good choice  style american lager  tapcanbottle can  abv 42  rating 3
129,Miller Lite,3.03,not a bad beer
130,Miller Lite,1.3,tasteless and watery for a socalled pilsner smell was like corn chips tasteless sandpaper mouthfeel like a mix master full of gravel looks like bunny pee overall waste of money
131,Miller Lite,3.51,its ok not the best and not the worst in my opinion id put this behind coors light and way above the no good bud light its just a typical light beer its better than something like natural light and bud light but below coors light in my opinion id be ok if it was the only beer available at least it doesnt taste like water
132,Miller Lite,1.28,its definitely drinkable but theres many better light macro lagers miller lite is among the worst along with bud lite busch lite natural lite and michelob
133,Miller Lite,2.9,cant go wrong with miller lite good beer
134,Miller Lite,3.25,a good cheap session pilsner first one i have had in over 20 years and didnt realize they still made it
135,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.24,purchased as a 24oz can poured into a pint glass  a  pours a golden color initially thick foamy white head recedes quickly poor head retention and no lacing lots of small bubbles rising through the brew  s  adjuncts alcohol and malty notes abound abv is not very well hidden here  t  malt and sweet corn to start with fusels and a faint sour apple flavor showing up on the finish not as egregiously tart as stack 101 but its noticeable  m  thinbodied with medium carbonation it goes down relatively easily but the mouthfeel of this hgl leaves much to be desired outside of that  o  it has a cool can design and the product is inoffensive enough not to be a drain pour but nothing about it really invites me to try it again tick complete reviewed to style ymmv
136,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.68,a random pickup from a local wine stores cooler i couldnt ask for a lower price on a themed drink to go alongside my dd game later that day which featured a similar dog creature  the upsides of this beer stop about there  while not bad nothing about this beer stood out from under the label drinking straight from the can i cant speak of colour or clarity though a lager that doesnt try to coat me with the head foam as i open it isnt trying hard enough  the most appealing feature of this brew seems to be the 24oz can of 8 abv for around 2 since id compare it to the big brand light beers but trying too hard to be bursting with the wrong sort of flavours
137,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,1.94,drank from a 24 ounce can scores are based on the style  look  very attractive almost looks like a fancy craft beer stands out nicely on the shelf doesnt look at all like a malt liquor  smell  tiny wisp of corn mostly metallic water  taste  like a brownie covered in black pepper incredibly sweet slightly chocolatey and a strong alcohol bite  feel  thin body very mild fizz and some throat burn it needs to either be thicker or bubblier  overall  i had low expectations based on its 150 price tag and it hit them its not good but it isnt offensive id have it again but it definitely wouldnt be a first pick
138,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.05,why am i rating this the hell if i know lets say desperate times call for desperate measures poured into what uhmmmmjust a regular pint glass the appearance was a glossy clear yellow to mild orange color with speedy carbonation rising to fill a rapidly dieing head no lace the aroma had stiff sweet corn rice fusel alcohol and burnt grass the flavor had a huge alcoholic sweet buffing throwing itself into burnt grass burnt toast and sweet corn the aftertaste was distracting through fusel alcohol sweet corn and burnt grass and toast the mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with no sessionability whatsoever its a sipper by all means thats if one wants to sip it carbonation did feel appropriate for what this is supposed to be abv seemed as projected finish was fusel alcohol sweet corn and burnt toast overall didnt really like this at all for me but without being too harsh i realize this style doesnt really clean up too well keep trying maybe a brewer out there eventually will be able to brew a kickass version of this i seriously doubt this brewery will
139,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,1.89,this beer tastes like watered down natty daddy it has a slightly greater fruity taste but its subtle the can is interesting with an orange color and cerberus design if you want to get buzzed for cheap you cant beat it
140,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.94,very smooth for 8 beer tastes kinda like coors original but nearly twice as strong
141,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.6,pours a perfectly crystal clear light yellow a white fizzy head dies quickly  aroma of corn spent grain spent hops and fusel alcohol  flavor has a neutral note almost then the corn and rice sweetness sets in small stale hop does a little to balance then a soft alcohol note for 8 it could be more ghastly than it is
142,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,5,nasty yellow color but it does product a full inch of head even if it quickly vanishes with no lace no trace aroma was metallic alcohol  fuck the body is thin on this lots of corn syrup aluminum and rubbing alcohol eventually it starts to numb your senses with the alcohol burn and thin body man i can appreciate some malt liquor but this is asking too much of me
143,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.44,a the beer is clear amber yellow in color and has a light to moderate amount of visible carbonation it poured with a quarter finger high white head that died down leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface and a thin collar around the edge of the glass s light aromas of sweet malts are preset in the nosecorn seems to stand out in particular along with faint hints of alcohol t the taste follows the smell but flavors of alcohol start to creep in there is a lingering aftertaste of alcohol in the finish m it feels mediumbodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation o this beer isnt nearly as offensive compared to some of the other malt liquors that ive had  serving type can
144,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,1.5,nasty yellow color but it does product a full inch of head even if it quickly vanishes with no lace no trace aroma was metallic alcohol  fuck the body is thin on this lots of corn syrup aluminum and rubbing alcohol eventually it starts to numb your senses with the alcohol burn and thin body man i can appreciate some malt liquor but this is asking too much of me
145,Black Label Beer,4.5,good cold like to drink it in the morning
146,Black Label Beer,3.5,this was definitely one of the beers that we consumed mass quantities of while we were in high school back in cleveland ohio i just hope that i gave this beer a decent rating from what i can remember about it besides the name
147,Black Label Beer,1.15,499 sixer at some random gas station in toledo ohio never seen it but it waa priced alright and i am a member of the infamous  gotta try em all club  well here goes  look  golden without a head woah never seen that in an aal dead carbonation welp  smell  rotten sweaty sock ahh must be a canadian lager  taste  solvent and sweat pesticide riddled corn mineral water on the back end was at least acceptable  feel  sticky and the sweetness ascends to ridiculousness fusel alcohol makes no sense at the abv swallow induces a gag  overall  i drink more aal than any other style and this shit is downright bad i dont care what fond memory you had on your fishing trip where your grandpa was throwing this shit back before telling you stories about nam if you see somebody drinking this slop have an intervention yuck
148,Black Label Beer,3.35,12oz cans stamped may 1319 poured into a hockey skate mug at fridge temp no abv indicated on can the beer pours bright very light yellow with nearly white head the head recedes to a single layer of bubbles and leaves a little lacing the aroma is more corny and vegetable than anything the taste is corny and wet with a bit of tart the mouthfeel is thin bodied adequately carbonated and undry in the finish theres a pronounced butterysoapy aftertaste and feel that is not altogether inviting overall not so good this 812 pack takes me back to high school but it will be a short visit
149,Black Label Beer,2.35,do not believe it was brewed by pabst when i had it even pabst couldnt have dragged this one down the lone highlight if you will is that the beer has some taste kind of sweet and malty not poor but only a notch above it
150,Black Label Beer,3,pours a pale goldenstraw in color and as clear as can be  not much to go on in the nose or aroma segment its inoffensive neutral and clean with malt character dominating the very low in character anyway corn syrup no hop presence whatsoever  light and somewhat crisp on the first sip sweetish as with the nose an inoffensive character with little in the way of malt depth by which anyone might find interest or something to engage in or even to recommend to another lover of characterful lager real ale or craft beer finish using the dry side for what its worth  boring and inoffensive is not the sort of phrase id use to recommend a beer to anyone else but in the right circumstances thats exactly the sort of beer thats called for and black label fits the bill most of the time  and its cheap too well a quarter or more higher in price than the lowliest of the low in the malt liquor category 211 but when youre on a budget and want a brand to relax with but not get crunk on this is a goto  if you can even find it  not recommended for people who have little sense of humor in an increasingly absurd world for the fact is with taprooms opening on every block in every major city it wont be long before retailers will refuse to stock rubbish such as this owing to the fact that theres so much local craft beer in cans nowadays rejoice motherxxxxxxx   for some reason its got a presence in cold boxes in minneapolis and saint paul which was not one of its original markets back when carling and later carlingnational moved down from canada to become a big player in the brewing industry in the usa the glory days of mabel but i digress  at any rate the market presence is probably due more to the consolidation of brands and brand swapping that went on when heileman closed and pabst and miller split up some of the available brands
151,Black Label Beer,2.55,well this isnt horrible it has a definite taste which is saying a lot for an adjunct lager which being a canadian beer might explain that still it reminds me of a lot of a low level euro lager but not quite as appealing
152,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),4.58,wonderful
153,Titan IPA,3.77,had on tap at boondocks fun center thornton  on arrival there is a very light haze in a deep gold body dome lacing forms  aroma is more of an old school wcipa with a touch of dank edd and an almost toasty malt in the very back not as intense as expected slight bitter herbal hops that are almost but not quite piney  taste follows the aroma with a decent bitterness right up front that carries an herbal dank flavor that fades slightly to a mellow pine resin and toasted malt super clean and crisp  the feel is super smooth due to a dryness taming the full malty body finish is longer and is very balanced with a slight warming sensation very good 7 ipa in this category  overall this is pretty good nothing crazy out of the ordinary but a solid wc style ipa with a reasonably unique hop profile
154,Titan IPA,4.11,112022 12oz can from washington beer store chilly sunday afternoon before the steelersbrowns game  look is a cloudy gold in leahs glass but clear in mine same can  aroma is tropical pineapple and mango slight maltiness  decent carbonation sweet breadiness bordering on banana bread slight sour undertones nice mouthfeel hop is present through the whole experience  not overly powerful brewers notes describe this well
155,Titan IPA,4.04,poured a slightly hazy light orange amber color with a two finger white head that dissipated slowly leaving heavy lacing i suspect that the haziness is from being a few months past the can date  fruity nose with pineapple and citrus  malty flavor balanced with citrus and a piney finish  medium body and carbonation  overall an enjoyable aipa
156,Titan IPA,4.4,light amber colour pinapple smell and a bouquet of exotic fresh fruits with a bucket of ipa thrown in
157,Titan IPA,4.5,good stuff period theres a lot of ipas out there to have but as a colorado boy this is good stuff great intro to the brewery nice balance of hops and citrus definitely one of the better ones ive had
158,Bud Ice,3.88,honestly not a bad beer a bit bready up front but it has no offensive flavors and goes down smooth for what it is this is a good go to cheap beer this is budweiser 20 and has a much crisper finish im a big fan of this beer and think its one of the best budget options out there i used to be a huge ipa guy but im now coming around to the fact that beers like this absolutely have their place
159,Bud Ice,3.55,poured from a 25oz can into a 3 floyds pint glass pours a clear straw gold with a finger a white foam that eventually fades away no lacing of course but its not a bad looking beer smell isnt much neither is the taste it has that corn product domestic lager thing going on but it isnt terrible almost refreshing and appreciate the abv very carbonated on the mouthfeel what is there to say really this is what it is and i enjoy it here and there its at least got some alcohol content to it to make it worth drinking which it is
160,Bud Ice,2.01,this beer is sour but not like a sour beer not that good high alcohol for low price feeling the economy pinch so i bought this no smell to it light carbonation clean taste that ghosts pretty quick
161,Bud Ice,3.53,i like my ipas bitternowadaysbrewers sell ipas to the masses that taste and smell like mangosi dont drink mangos i have gone back to macros for my everyday beerthis is a 55 beerits tasteif cold as it meant to be drankis cleanbut carbonatedit looks dark goldenwho caresit smells like a cheapadjunct beerbut not offensivedont take a large whiffit aint that kind of beeri laugh at the morons that claim that this is a get drunk beerits 55less than any micro i drink lookits brewed by budsay what you wantbut they know what they are doinglooking for microtaste at this price pointagainyoure a moronthis is a cheap beer that has a clean taste for an adjunctit aint bad for what it is at all
162,Bud Ice,3.96,the taste is good for how high alcohol content it is it is a good cheap beer its my everyday drink after work after keystone stop selling keystone eyes
163,Bud Ice,4,darker gold than regular budweiser soapy loose head that doesnt linger smells very neutral tastes like bread crackers malted grain very little in the way of hops crisp with a surprisingly nice aftertaste theres a little alcohol heat on the backend as well probably from being brewed with rice or corn syrup i think this beer gets a bad rap because its cheap it also makes good micheladas if your into that
164,Bud Ice,2.18,only picked this one up because a fresh batch of 18 oz bottles came in and i figured hell i hate budweisers line of products even after a fair shake of trying them so may as well try this one too since im a fair guy first one had no carb had to go get a replacement short walk this one carbonation is fine heyoooooooo tastes the same as the previous bottle with no carbonation but with bubbles ya these things are just beer for bums to get buzzed in a blaze of time which i think makes it good for what it is im just not lookin for it on the ice beer scale lower in terms of choice if one had the options of course not everyone is as fair as i
165,Bud Ice,2.25,poured from an undated 12oz can  on the pour a fizzy soda like head forms then quickly disappears entirely carbonation is very lively and the color is a yellow gold  aroma is rough a bit of green apple off sweetness followed by a skunky note and finished by a rough bad smell that i couldnt say where it came from smells like expired cider even ice cold  flavor isuch better than the aroma fortunately with some malts actually present zero hops however a fuel and alcohol flavor is present in the very back despite only being 55 abv has the same ricey light note as standard bud not the worst bit not good to be honest everything leading up to this had me expecting worse  feel is light watery and has a lot of co2 bite despite all its flaws when ice cold this beer is relatively refreshing and some head does form when sipped despite being headless in the glass it gets the job done but its still not great  overall this is just a cheaper stronger version of budweiser if you like bud and are on a budget this might be fore you but mhl is the same price and scores better in every category
166,Bud Ice,2.65,not bad for the price not a fan of the mouthfeel but this is one of the best bangs you can get for your buck legendary among alcoholics
167,Bud Ice,2.96,if im picking one 25 ounce beer to drink its between this or budweiser similar to bud in taste beechwood aged with stronger alcohol at 55 percent biting on your tongue overpowering decent smell when breathing through your nose not as enjoyable but better buzz in a pinch
168,Bud Ice,1,drainpour
169,Sphere,4.28,my second beer using the new yeast after satin and theres a strong similarity between the two not just hazy this one pours milky yelloworange nose is more muted than is usual for treehouse but it got stronger as the beer warmed with the galaxy being very noticeable  taste is of generic fruit with lots of astringent rind that rind is what makes it a little different from a hundred other neipas but theres nothing about it that screams treehouse  in summary a competent nedipa but nothing id go out of way for which puts it below most treehouse beers
170,Sphere,4.25,serving can canned jul212023 consumed aug112023  pours milky whiteyellow with a middling head the aroma is fairly punchy upon popping the can generic tropical fruit once in the glass howeverwhile still nicesmellingthis punchiness is a bit diminished and still just generically fruity the flavor has a bit more of a thin bitterness than expected or suggested by the nose this lingers into the finish not quite juicy either in taste smell or body the mouthfeel is along similar lines a little fluffiness but not quite as luxurious as i am used to with their beers a little astringency but not quite astringent it feels weird to not just pound in my normal 475s for look and feel on a th beers were in strange times when i saw what they were doing for the data set series i was bummed id missed it but i am really glad to be able to taste what came out the other end thanks papillon senses  still not a fan first off maybe its the power of suggestion however as a fanboy i really wanted to like it so where does that leave us secondly this was a little on the older side yet not only did none of what i picked up jibe with age but at the brewery i had a very fresh one with the same yeast and got the same overall impression on a different day in a different setting finally the other beer i had velvet was all newfangled hops that i dont have much experience with however this one was good old standbys that not only do i know well but i know well specifically in th beers  what it all comes down to for me is that whether its a good biotransforming yeast strains or not the ester profile is sorely sorely missed and in its place there is an eversoslight astringency not the most adequate word maybe hollowness to the hop character that takes away from the beer i am far from an expert but have had a lot of their beers at multiple stages of my life as a beer nerd and their life as a brewery that first smell and drink of a th beer is always obviously a th beer and it has always been exquisite this one was not obviously theirs in that sense and was very good at best no audible gasps here thats a first for me or in this case a second after velvet  anyway i am extremely happy to have tried this it was a really educational experience it reinforces my belief that even though you can load something down with hops and get something delicious in the best of neipas the yeasts ester profile is doing at least as much for the overall character if you count biotransformation maybe even more so as they say if it aint broke dont fix it  425425425425425
171,Sphere,4.31,had on tap at sandwich pours milky peach in color with one third inch head taste is peach cherry dank hops and pineapple medium light body moderate carbonation slightly bitter impressive one of their better recent releases have not been a fan of some of he recent new yeast stuff but this is good
172,Sphere,4.29,from a 16oz can dated 072123 served in a spiegelau ipa glass  pours a murky utterly opaque milkyorange with a fingerplus of supersoft creamy head retention is excellent leaving a sudsy cap and a solid sheet of foamy lacing this is what nedipa looks like  nose is creamy sweet and allover squishy jungle fruit  aromas of ripe pineapple and mango ice cream  taste is dank as the dickens less sweet and creamy and with more rindy bitterness than anticipated tasting grapefruit rinds and woody underripe pineapple cores grapefruit juice mango skins orange peel sandalwood and bhang water a little pardonable onion  feel is juicy mediumplus bodied with bright tingly carbonation hop oils and carbonation combine in a peppery tonguecoating firecracker assault spoton relative to the style  overall dank and juicy as is thoroughly right and proper legitimately bitter albeit in an unripe fruit peel sort of way the can promises me a lush wave of overripe pineapple but i found the pineapple to be underripe and woody and could easily have believed that i was tasting a touch of simcoe rather than of citra im going to rate most aspects of this rather highly based on the one pour however i dont think i could possibly drink a 2nd can without a full 12 hour rest break in between
173,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.29,the pour is amber colored with a moderate amount of carbonation i get a lot of smoke on the aroma moreover the smoke is there on the taste as well plus some cherrywood  baked biscuits are in there too this was a good rauchbier that you should try out if you like this style there is no date on the bottle cheers a
174,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.37,16 oz can no datecode pulled from 4pack at state line yesterday poured into my 05l unibroue becher glass  l deep tawnycolored liquid good clarity tight agedwhite fingerplus high foam pad a medthick collar maintains laces only a little  s boldly smoky and woody in the vein of their other brands but a whole new sugarconcentrated driedfruity mildly sourredale undertone that nearly matches the smoke in intensity its really sparking my interest cant wait to drink  t the nonsmoke flavors dont quite match the aromas with the suggestion of fruity and sour tones pulling way back allowing a rather densely breadcrusty malt foundation to be front and center almost like an irish red the smoke is bold but not too intense while theres a relatively acidic midtone lingering and even a whisper of earthy hops in the aftertaste  f medlight bodied and delicately silky in its initial swell the intensity of the smoke stokes a tingly flame throughout the palate up into the nostrils my nose feels rosy  o quite possibly the most intriguing aromas ive encountered from a rauchbeer its flavors compliment its color its taste over time though failed to hold my interest it begs for a more roastednutty delicatelycaramelly undertone 2227
175,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.13,1pint 09oz bottle into a pint glass no freshness dating but a recent release  splendid looking beer deep reddish amber persistent off white head thick rings of lacing smoky meaty aroma on tasting there is a light sweetness to offset the smoked pork flavor clean finish with a featherlight bitter note another fine smoked beer from aecht schlenkerla
176,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.32,poured into a fremont small snifter pours a medium to dark coppery orange with a one finber light khaki head with great retention and solid lacing looks great aroma of pale malt smokehouse smokiness hints of cherry and raisins flavor is lightly biscuit malt smokehouse smokiness with umami raisins brown bread and mild cherry wood light bitterness in the finish with residual wood smoke medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess i wasnt sure how this one would turn out since i liked the bock versions much better than the lighter malt ones in fact the bock aecht beers are among my favorites however like their lighter lentenbier the smokiness is tempered a little to fit the malt which has more depth than i expected from the modest abv the faint cherry notes really added to my enjoyment when i get a hankering for a rauchbier the urbock and dopplebock are going to be my first choices but i will definitely return to this too these guys are the smoked beer masters
177,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.42,deep brown leather ruby color off white head that leaves thick lacing bands and erratic bubbles on the top light gets through and can make out my finger for about a foot or two on the other side of the glass nose is smoke meat cherry jam wood roasted nuts which with the cherry almost make a pbj note in the nose taste is malty bread graham cracker cherry smoke meat with a cherry smoke finish somehow way cleaner on the finish than any of those tastes would suggest medium body and medium carbonation
178,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,3.85,pours a clear mahogany brief fizzy 05 light tan head that quickly settles out no retention and very little lacing nose is beef jerky liquid smoke and leather though not as richlybeefyas others in the lineup taste gets most of its smoke from the aroma while on the palate there is a much greater malt sweetness and light caramel perhaps this sweetness comes from the cherry wood used to smoke but i feel like if the smokiness was peeled away this would taste much like helles mouthfeel follows in the that vein and it is very drinkable and refreshing despite the umami notes not my favorite schlenkerla but still very good
179,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.33,poured into pint glass murky amber offwhite head faint smokey nose  cherrywood really comes out on the flavor with noasted malt notes this one isnt as heavy as other offerings from this brewery  lighter crisper mouthful on this one too  schlenkerlas lighter smoked beer nice prelude to autumn this
180,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.31,single 05l bottle from jungle jims i swear i smell some bacon smoke has a good presence but certainly not as intense as their original i like this one a lot
181,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.53,fantastic lighter more crisp rauchbier than their other offerings i had read reports of a buttery diacetyl mouthfeel and i dont get it this beer is anything but slimy the mf is really what shines on this for me  the smoke is slightly attenuated compared to the marzen but im not finding it that much different in flavor ill add some more notes and nuances as i revisit this again
182,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.28,cherry wood comes through nicely on this ruby brown beer both in nose and taste smoke plays in but isnt too strong and definitely not overpowering reminds me of an old slightly smoky malt whiskey in flavor profile without any of the alcohol burnbite of course a cherry malty beer with a dose of smoke to make things interesting balanced in a way that works pretty well for me
183,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.27,pours a light yellowish brown color looks like a dark reddishamber in the glass decent carbonation thick head dense and sticky with nice sheeting inside the glass fantastic smoked aroma gently sweet as the beer opens up cherry wood smoke the taste follows along the lines of the smell mild cherry sweetness like diluted cherry cough drops wood ash and cherry wood smoke very mild smokey phenols mediumheavy body lightly sticky on the palate  this phenomenal new beer from brauerei hellertrum should appeal to most fans of their beechwood smoked beers there is enough similarity to the urbock and m√§rzen yet distinct enough with its light cherry tones  pouring temperature 41 f bottling info na source cstamp3084
184,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.23,here it is the new schlenkerla beer that has the whole beer community paying attention well more like a small subset of the ba beer nerds but i digress im quite excited to try this one as ive only had one other rotbier before and it was most certainly not smoked lets crack it open and see what it has to offer  pours a clear copper with 2 fingers of rocky light beige head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  i was expecting a more subtle smokiness in this one but its up front in the nose im picking up on aromas of cherrywood smoke biscuity malt floral hops smoked ham cedar brown sugar black pepper and raisin  the smoke is a bit more subdued in taste but it makes for a balanced beer on the front end of the sip im tasting biscuity malt floral hops beechwood smoke honey black pepper dark bread red berries and light brown sugar the swallow brings notes of cherrywood smoke biscuity malt earthy hops dark toast brown sugar molasses light raisin and brown sugar  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick beer finishes neutral with a slight bite that dries it out over time  another winner from schlenkerla im glad i picked uo a 4 pack of this one when i stopped at oec over the weekend as well as the newtome kr√§usen
185,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.3,fantastic rauchbier as one should expect from aecht schlenkerla this style at a fairly low abv doesnt lend itself to the strong smoke as well as their more malty offerings theres just not enough depth and complexity on the palate although oddly there is a decent amount of sweetness  the smoke itself is wonderful and you can really pick up the difference from cherry wood than from other smoke choices the aroma is nothing short of delightful a campfire blending notes of wood smoke meat smoke and dark fruit  drinks clean and easy with a body a touch thicker than you might expect for the abv but which fits this beer very well
186,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,3.23,released summer 2023 drank 71223  the yarchives  seethrough dark red appearance  a rough pour yielded a big khaki head a thick curtain of frothy treerung lace  bacon smoke  faint berry notes in the nose  slick mouthfeel  campfire smoke melted butter  some bacon flavors  this tasted a bit offdiacetyl notes perhaps cant say i loved it
187,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.35,smoky woody deliciousness reminds of me of smoked sausage has a little bit of everything breadiness floral notes really enjoyed this
188,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.19,tested from a 16oz can sticker code is 1723 unsure if those numbers mean anything i will adjust this review after a few more cans at this point i like it but its not my favorite from this brewery its kinda light duty the cherry wood is nice goes good with grilled cheese bread
189,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,4.51,poured from a can into a snifter pours hazy orange yellow with a small white head smells of citrus and grassy hops with floral notes tastes of bright citrus with some creamy notes beer is medium bodied with a nice smooth finish good carbonation overall a superb beer
190,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,4.52,look  bright hazy orange with a nice white head sticky rimming and lacing smell  tropical fruit and slightly floral taste  floral peach and citrus tangerine with a slight floral and sweetness feel  medium full body fluffy creamy medium carbonation overall  really fantastic ipa wish the smell was a little more but still fantastic
191,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,4.9,148 yummy
192,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.73,had bottles 1 into a 7oz taster l pours fairly gold and clear w a thin white head some big carbo bubbles head recedes a little lacing s spicy hops caramel malts grains lightly earthy  sweet t follows aroma with corn sweet malts and hops well balanced it is lightly metallic f a gentle crisp hop snap then smooth  malty w some caramel sweetness in the medium bodied center it has a medfast finish that is lightly drying o a very easy drinking pale lager that is nice straight from the bottle they go quick a nice yearround beer ive seen only a few times it is lightly sweet and okay in its style
193,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),3.48,i used to enjoy this beeri drank it real cold and real fast being a small bottle it works well for this apparently its not very good based on other reviews but i enjoyed it
194,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),3.17,i recently got this beer it pours golden a little bit hazy with a very mild white foam head aroma is very sweet malty and some adjuncts no hops taste is very sweet lots of residual sugars there overwhelming and not very refreshing its a very good looking bottle with a poor content
195,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),3.12,poured from a 16oz can  bit of sweetness makes this actually not too bad
196,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.49,had the pleasure of sharing a 2018 bomber with my son poured nice and dark aromatic to the core with all the notes mentioned herein was a tad worried it was aged 5 years but it was the perfect age for us
197,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.63,bottled on 92519 consumed on 62723 served and consumed starting at 45 f and warming to close to room temperature  look deep dark brown almost but not quite black thin chocolate colored head but more than i expected for a four year old bottle  smell maple and chocolate and immediately obvious with noticeable bourbon as well little to no coffee  taste the strong maple sweetness and the bourbon are noticeable first some chocolate is there but very little coffee except for some bitterness in the aftertaste the lack of an overwhelming coffee taste works well here as it lets the maple and bourbon shine but provides just enough bitterness to offset the maple sweetness  feel silky and smooth with a moderate bite on the back end the 113 abv is more noticeable in the feel that the taste warmth and a mild sting from the alcohol are both present but not in overwhelming amounts  overall this is a worldclass beer for good reasons this is my very last bottle so unless founders rereleases it in the future ill just say cbs will forever be one of the absolute best barrel aged stouts i have ever had the pleasure of sampling
198,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.62,bottled 92519  poured at about 40 into a tulip glass  pours a deep coffee brown with a surprising one finger mocha colored head thin almost sheet like lacing and visible rising carbo impressive for this older brew 475  met with maple as soon as i opened the cap and its still the dominant note though there is some very slight bourbon 45  big maple and chocolate just a minor hint of coffee touch of char and barrel maybe slight leather 45  body is wicked smooth with zero sign of how big and burly this beer is slight warming blossom as it went down 113 is nonexistent even halfway through the bottle dangerous 5  overall a world class stout as it says it is that doesnt need my words but happily leave them anyway as it was a delight of an experience havent enjoyed this fresh but 4year mark is truly excellent 475
199,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.27,12 oz bottle bottled on date 10012019 consumed on 14 mar 2023 glass snifter abv 113 serving temp room temp   look opaque black with a 2 finger creamy light brown head the head slowly dissipates to a thick ring and thin cover lacing is excellent  smell a fairly sweet nose semisweet chocolate some brown sugar and maple syrup light notes of vanilla faint ones of coffee a touch of bourbon  taste follows the nose but with the maple and the sweetness much more pronounced and the bourbon notes the coffee cannot be noticed until fairly late in the sip the alcohol is noticeable and provides a bit of a sting at the end along with warmth  feel smooth silky and mouthcoating very noticeable warmth and a sting from the alcohol the body is mediumfull  overall a very nice imperial stout complex this brew is definitely sweet which makes it a dessert beer for me  just to note  this beer is 25 years old that must have had an effect
200,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.33,2019 bomber poured at 53 into a founders brewing sniffer age said no head so this pours flat black with just a whisper of beige foam that ghosted out fast awesome roomfilling aroma of fresh pulled espresso a chocolatiers best offering in his shop quite light bourbon too bold flavor  but god awful sweet  tastes of dark chocolate covered coffee beans vanilla maple syrup a bit of mild tobacco finishes short with barrel and maple leaf candy left on the palate burp of coffee sticky lip thick really thick almost no carbonation at all overall this fine elixir wouldve been better served two years ago rather than letting it sit this long a beattiful effort nonetheless
201,CitraQuench'l,4.91,hazy gold like pineapple juice extremely strong grapefruit smell and taste also confirmed by my wife tasty hoppy but not too harsh pleasant all the way through the sip very good easy to drink
202,CitraQuench'l,4.5,pours a light hazy golden color with a nice head and lacing aroma has generous tropical and citrus hints the taste follows the nose with a well balanced tropical and citrus flavor a medium bodied well carbonated beer a great neipa
203,CitraQuench'l,4.24,i believe itd rate higher fresher still a tasty beer tho
204,CitraQuench'l,4.03,juicy looking pour the color seems a bit lighter golden it really looks like a glass of pineapple juice but with a very frothy and fluffy 2 finger white head the beer has great head retention and theres a good amount of lacing on the glass to be honest im not getting much on the nose its a fairly faint citrus hop aroma taste  theres a citrus flavor to this beer due to the hops and i think its tangerine that im getting from the hops the flavor from the hops really keeps building in my throat and on my taste buds the flavor lingers in my throat and i just keep tasting it the body is juicy and also has a crisp feeling the hops linger in my throat but they dont feel sticky or like resin this is a delicious example of the style the aroma was a bit of a let down it is a bit over a month old so maybe that plays a factor into it that being said the flavor is there
205,CitraQuench'l,4.3,had on tap at the bass lake draft house in holly springs nc  this was a tasty hazy ipa not a great amount of head but the hazy appearance and color were good for the style dank citrus fruit aromas were the outstanding aspect of this beer with the taste almost as good worth trying if you get the chance
206,Amstel Lager,1.19,hate it sick if it everywhere in the coast i go away to relax and enjoy a holiday not to walk around from one bar to the next looking for something else other than this puke dreadful taste worse aftertaste and whats with bars not only offering in draft they have to subject us to it in a bottle as well no imagination when i managed bars the trick was to offer choice to get as many customers as possiblenot limit them bad management
207,Amstel Lager,1.61,forgettable beer
208,Amstel Lager,2.58,its everywhere in cura√ßao and its pretty bad i woyld prefer tha other offerings the dutchers have pretty bad pallets and choice in beer very low energy
209,Amstel Lager,4.56,crispy fresh with a certain je ne sais quoi a very solid beer in my honest opinion which you can drink either with food or if you are having a few bevvys with the girls
210,Amstel Lager,2.52,from bottle and on tap on numerous occasions an average lager very average once a halfdecent lager for the amsterdam region later chosen as heinekens downmarket brand
211,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.79,kind of a cidery small high abv but would not assume it was an ipa nor a double ipa based on taste and smell alone
212,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.59,12 ounce can for a dollar from trader joes pours ok little head stays stinks its pretty rank on the nose tastes unfocused and strange a malt backbone saves it but as the brew warmed i considered a sink pour but obliged myself to finish glad i only got one i dont want another feels kinda thick mid carbonation overall yuck not a belgian not a double ipa malt liquor would be a compliment
213,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),4.08,it reminds me of a less bitter less complex version of arrogant bastard which i truly love i would also compare this to a winter warmer another style i enjoy i think arrogant bastard used special b malt which i dont detect in this beer it is very malt with some pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste i would buy this again trader joes sells this for a fantastic price for a 6 pack this is not a hazy or juicy dipa
214,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.5,poured 12 oz can into neculated muffin top glass pleasing dark amber color seemed to have an abundant amount of lacing in the glass about 3 fingers of head immediately developed a couple of tastes of head alone gave me a bit of lightheadedness faint malt aroma heavy fruitiness taste for me was not all that appealing mouth was smooth with a hint of bitterness at the end i guess i am not an ipa guy probably this is my one and only 6 pack to go
215,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.89,ahhhh the vaulted approximately 085 iipa offering at the world famous watering hole trader joes expectations set to overly critical thumbs set to overdrive here we go  theres a number of bad reviews of this beer here on beer advocate and yes i completely see where most of them are coming from i mean really  is this really a iipa wheres the citrus wheres the pine wheres that gorgeous gorgeous it says 75 ibus on the can but im guessing thats a typo bitterness other than the abv an iipa this is not  and a belgian its not even that great a belgian sure its got the sweetness and maybe it could barely pass the mouthful test but wheres the dark fruit complexity wheres the depth wheres the hooded monks slaving over a barrel of dark sumptuous gloriously syrupy ale a belgian it clearly is not  so then what is this monstrosity of a about 085 per can beverage what is it and why did i just score it 4  boatswain double ipa 84 poured from can into a clear doublesided microwave and dishwasher safe coffee mug from costco  l it says appearance deep amber in all caps on the can its not the deepest of amber ive ever seen on a beer but its not in this is false advertising territory either this is a pretty heavy pour  justfinishedassemblingsomefurnitureandiwantabeerquick type pour its got quite a bit of a head that dissipates in a fair amount of time there is lacing on the glass so thats a plus under the light its like i said not the deepest of amber its cloudy with the lightest of fizz its not bad for what it is  and its a  s oooooooh sweeeet like peach and biscuits and a little vanilla its malty  you can smell the sweet molassesey maltiness of this its almost like a  t malt malt malt malt sweetness hits first im guessing they use a fair amount of crystal malt theres a very slight hint of that peach a little banana and a little bit of that sweet vanilla that hits too theres a little hint of that hop bitterness its there more pine than citrus not overly complex and then theres the aftertaste im writing like thats a bad thing  its not its pleasant honey sweet maybe and it lingers for a bit i like it personally all things considered its a pretty straightforward ale  malt biscuit sweet with enough bitterness to balance it out a complete letdown as an iipa but its pretty good as a  f im nearly at the end of this glass relishing every last drop to fill this review in maybe one mouthful left instantly regretting letting my wife try some but hey a shared beer is a good beer its syrupy like a honey lemon drink made by someone with one too many pots of honey in their kitchen and it lingers too  in your mouth and on your lips it clings to your throat and sinuses or thats just the weather talking its thick and glossy and what youd expect from a  malt liquor actually more like a double amber ale i mean its got everything an amber would have but like doubled i actually like my british style ambers with their sweet malt biscuitiness and their simplicity and i like this beer as an amber it does exactly what youd expect and a little more and as a malt liquor you get a complexity that very few 085 about a can a beer can get you its easy to drink its accessible its allround pretty good and id probably get a few more once i get over the expected hangover  tldr its less than a dollar bought at trader joes its not chimay or pliny or whatever iipa is in fashion but its not kingfisher strong or red horse or some bottom shelf nonsense its a good marginally complex ale that id recommend to new drinkers whod like to try something different
216,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.41,this is a great starting point if your not familiar with double ipas not to strong but enough of a kick yes there is a slight aftertaste that is kinda weird but this is a totally drinkable beer and so affordable give this one a taste i will definitely buy this again thank you trader joes
217,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.19,i love the reviews i read for this beer i was given a 6pack by my daughters boyfriend i think its pretty good and now that i know its so cheap i like it even better
218,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.4,this is an odd one it tastes like a belgian ale trying really really hard to be an imperial ipa and not a great belgian either too thin to be a belgian almost no bitterness not a lot of complexity in the flavors here could be improved by picking once and for all what this beer wants to do with its life and then either adding citrus peel to make it more belgiany or more hops to make it more imperial it does not taste double hopped but it definitely hits like a double ipa at 84 while also being five bucks a 6pack at trader joes so that does sway my review here if it were any more expensive or tasted any worse id say its not worth it but as its less than a dollar a can for a drinking experience that is not overtly unpleasant ill say its a good value for its price will likely buy again next time my job cuts my hours
219,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.04,this is my 1st attempt at submitting a rating on this site the plethora of beer snobs and their command of beer speak on this siteis impressive heres my review    i agree with the notion that this brews taste is more belgian than ipa    nevertheless its inyourface flavor is pretty good with an abv of 84 and a price point that cant be beat    this is the perfect get buzzed quick brew btw it pairs well with most sativas 
220,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),1.82,let me start out by saying this beer sucks all of the boatswain beers taste awful but given todays current inflation the price point cannot be beat at 499 plus deposit and tax its still a great value this is how i get around that nasty taste just add a tsp of fresh lime juice more or less depending on taste now you have a corona on steroids just dont pore in a clear glass lol
221,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.82,nice amber color but the head is massive loose bubbles like root beer or cola that lasts maybe 1 minute no lacing overtly malty smell and taste unremarkable mouthfeel much more like a badly executed belgian than any kind of ipa my wife called it disgusting
222,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.67,overall this beer reminds me a lot of pyramid brewings outburst ipa a dominating sweet malt bill nothing citrusy about the european type hops along with a high abv if you like outburst you will like this beer very much a 90s type beer  12 oz can no package date poured into a pint glass  pours a light orangehoney colored body with a white head not much retention a few rings of speck lacing  nose is very understated im getting sweet malt with a tiny whiff of german style hops  taste is very reminiscent of pyramid brewings outburst ipa hops under the radar along with a dominating sweet malt bill  feel is appropriate for the style  overallsee first paragraph
223,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),1.44,lol this would be an acceptable belgian strong ale slap in the face if you expect a double ipa
224,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),4.65,an excellent dipa easy to drink i enjoyed straight out of the can as well as in a glass has a strong hoppy aftertaste that feels good in the back of the throat
225,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.58,if you love beer you will like this one alot not the best but not the worst im not a dangle my pinky and talk about the flavor notes type i just like beer this one is tasty but strong and goes down easy give it shot you will not regret it if you do put it back on the shelf because then there will be more for me
226,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),1.61,it literally tastes like how a bandaid smells you know what im talking about here rubber and cotton and adhesive  i jumped on this at tjs today  a double ipa for 499 sure sign me up the amber color of my first pour was surprising as was the nose  rubber and alcohol but the taste is what put this over the edge  sweet and malty  not anything like any double ipas ive ever tried downright nasty actually it has an 84 abv which is great and all  if you can stomach this abominationi cant  even at this price point im never doing this again
227,Prior 8,3.98,good initial offwhite head when poured from the bottle and nice lacing throughout body is an opaque redbrown  aroma is a sweet malt with a dried fruit fig raisin presence pleasant  taste follows nose and the malt more fully expresses itself dark fruit returns and is complimented by yeast notes and a bit of light spice the finish reveals a modest hop taste then dries up  good strong carbonation and the mouthfeel is moderate drinks lighter than its abv no hint of the alcohol
228,Prior 8,4.17,for a double it was good not outstanding
229,Prior 8,4.22,750ml bottle into a brugges glass freshness dating minuscule  looks fantastic dark reddish brown body thick foamy off white head retains well and leaves tons of lacing  clean malty aroma  so easy drinking clean smooth sweet with some dark fruit notes  mouth between medium and full finish somewhat sweet  overall a delightful drink dubbels arent usually my thing but this is an excellent drink
230,Prior 8,4.5,cloudy reddish brown big khaki head excellent retention and bands of lace warm spices dried fruit rum cake aroma quatre epices rumsoaked fruit cake a bit earthier than the pater or abt in flavor medium bodied and well carbonated this is excellent but i like the pater better
231,Prior 8,4.22,l huge 3 finger frothy head on top of a dark brown body s sweet plum cherry raisin mild spices caramelized fruit dough chocolate t caramelized fruit upfront molasses plum raisin pie cherries slightly bitter hops behind all of this yeastiness that i cant really describe a hint of apple and chocolate on the finish f high carbonation slight froth in the mouth fairly well masked alcohol o expected the body to be sweeter but not at all disappointed none of the cloying fruit syrupiness that some dubbels have all the flavors flow together quite nicely worth the price
232,Prior 8,4.39,bottle from johns poured into rochefort tulip quintessential dubbel
233,Prior 8,4.71,my favorite belgian dubbel so far beautiful in every way i love the way the finish stays with you long after the last sip pretty near perfect for me
234,Traquair House Ale,4.02,500ml bottle into a pint glass best by may 2029  excellent looking beer deep deep amber body with reddish hints well carbonated and the off white head retains well leaving streaks of lacing aroma is strong malty and sweet with faint hints of scotch  strong tasting as well massive malt bill notes of scotch peat and the barrel a little sweet finish is slightly drying  overall full bodied wee heavy nice beer to muse over watching cricket and soccer this evening
235,Traquair House Ale,3.82,smell gives off molasses plum very malty the body is very crisp coming out like a really crunchy crust of bread followed shortly by a sumptious flow of molasses plum some cacao and caramel too the bodys great very malty and thick yet crisply carbonated carries flavor amazingly the flavor is mellow for the price though to be honest
236,Traquair House Ale,4.42,112 fl oz bottle looks like a best by date of jan 2032 a new oddity to me from the local beer spot handmade ale brewed in the ancient brew house of the oldest inhabited house in scotland  poured to a clear stemless wine snifter a pours a dark mahogany  chestnut  ruby body small conjuring of tan bubbles that remains as a surface skimming it does appear adequately carbonated with some good sticky lacing legs s aroma is deep  intricate definitely a beer to ponder after a quaff it hits softly but is super layered  complex aromas of smoke cherry wood some minor alcohol  booze fumes vanilla caramel cream again this aroma is soft almost supple but the authenticity on display here is the stunning part t taste brings in what the nose promises notes of smoke raisin oak wood vanilla caramel cream only slightly sweet but never overly sugary or sticky subtle dark fruits  cherry raisin with just a hint of copper bottle says this beer is brewed in a 1738 copper kettle before being fermented on oak mouthfeel is absolutely perfect for this type of beer carbonation is lowww super easy drinking for the modest 72 abv  overall authentic  absolutely delicious traquair house ale 455
237,Traquair House Ale,4.3,poured from 112ounce bottle into a thistle glass or maybe a vase deep reddish brown colored body with ruby highlights and a light tan head that left minimal lacing as it settled a fruity note is prominent with sweet roasted malt light caramel and a hint of smoke oaky tannins on the finish with some lingering bitterness overall a fine beer that begs for a food accompaniment bangers anyone
238,Traquair House Ale,4.46,i really like the color on this one held in front of a mag light its kind of a shiny metallic redbrown smells good too malty woody and vinous flavor is rich malt oak and surprisingly a pleasant fruitiness tannins from the cask apparent which mingle with hops and add some black tea notes resinous mouth feel briny carbonation a wee bit light in body for a heavy alcohol undetectable i love this beer
239,Traquair House Ale,4.32,purchased at purvis beer in richmond a suburb of melbourne in australia in november 2021  colour is hard to describe is it muddy brown or amber or dark burnt copper maybe all of them  aroma has cola some dark fruits a tangy caramellyness and some tobacco  taste has sweetness brown sugar burnt molasses raisins and red fruit alcohol is unnoticeable  mouthfeel is well balanced with mild carbonation  overall this is an excellent and given how well it hides its alcohol possibly quite dangerous beer it screams of warm fires misty walks and fogbound valleys beer as a device for long contemplation is on display in this glass if this is what the scottish lairds were drinking back in the day they were fortunate men  cheers
240,Traquair House Ale,4.5,bottle from altopalato served at home in a thistle glass brown color medium head with average retention good lacing aroma of licorice oak caramel prunes vanilla medium to full body viscous texture average carbonation sweet finish taste of licorice caramel prunes oak wonderful
241,Traquair House Ale,4.2,pours transparent dark amber small off white quickly dissipating head aromas of dark roasted malt warm leather work boots left out banana peels freshly packed marlboro reds flip top box decomposing leaves flavors of italian roast coffee carmel clove burnt sugar pumpernickel raisin oak feels crispy up front tiny effervescent bubbles medium body finishes semi dry overall not as sweet as many scotch ales and certainly hides the alcohol
242,Boatswain American IPA,1.51,as evidenced by the abundance of negative reviews this beer certainly is not worth experiencing for a refined palate it definitely has both in terms of taste and smell a metallic cheap odor however the value with which one can purchase this beer  less than 5 bucks for a 6 pack at trader joes  should be taken into consideration if you dont mind sipping on some horsesht beer that gets you buzzed after a few swigs this is the perfect way to enjoy a saturday afternoon with friends at a beach or at a cookout
243,Boatswain American IPA,1.06,not good its too bad trader joes lost the mission street brand it was much better than this will not be buying again
244,Boatswain American IPA,1,nasty
245,Boatswain American IPA,1.07,this is not only the worst ipa ive ever had but one of the worst beers ive ever had it tastes and smells like a cleaning product it tastes like its made with the lowest possible quality adjuncts like the same kind that they make really cheap malt liquor out of and the worst possible quality hops known to man  stay far away from this beer and the other trader joes boatswain brand beers its a crime that they discontinued their mission street brand ales which were actually good and replaced it with the beyond awful boatswain beer
246,Boatswain American IPA,5,well its 2022 with beer prices up 35 i refuse to be gouged by breweries just to have a cold one and ive gotten over brewpubs that dont properly carbonate their beers starting at 6 a pint this stuff has an alcohol content of 67  an ibu of 79 and costs 499 for a 6 pack bingo  ps  i drink beer to cool off in the summertimeand get a nice buzz at the same time not have a mouthgasm when i drink a beer i dont use phrases like banana and clove in abundance to describe it a good loud burb will suffice
247,Boatswain American IPA,3.11,definitely not an aipa but as an english esb not bad i am not getting the metallic or medicinal taste that others have but the bitterness of both the amber malt and the hops makes it taste like an amber ale absolutely worth the price for students looking for something other than pbr or coors they should look into brewing a mild just get rid of these hops they dont add to the flavor one bit
248,Boatswain American IPA,2.34,12oz can from trader joes light amber pour with a shortlived fizzy head aroma is malty and sweet taste is also malty with metallic notes taste like youre licking the can
249,Boatswain American IPA,1.06,honestly one of the more disgusting beers i have ever tastedmedicinal like a cleaning product so bad i am taking the time to look up and contribute my own review returning the rest of the 6 pack to trader joes tomorrow i hope the smell and taste fade sooner than later not to mention my upset stomach from just a few sips
250,Boatswain American IPA,1.38,just not a good ipa
251,Boatswain American IPA,3.02,from can 4 and change six pack at trader joes rhinelander brewing company smell is good appearance is a little cloudy for an ameican ipa feel i didnt enjoy holding in mouth for long  on the slightly hoppy side with balanced malt decent enough for the price
252,Boatswain American IPA,2.89,trader joes pickup they really do a good job with variety and weird proprietary stuff always have super under the radar i reckon but its neat to know i can roll in here anytime and find something ive never had before that might only be available in their stores and the price is always right this was under a buck for the single i think thankfully because its not worth any more than that thats for sure its real malty almost tastes like an extract brew rather than an all malt one which is shocking really for something marketed as craft at first i was kind of bummed about it but my wife pointed out that if you consider it like a malty english pale rather than an american ipa it has some redeemable qualities the grain is nutty and sweet amaretto and light brown sugar character caramelized some and the hops are more aromatic than flavorful there is just a moderate late bitterness that comes in decidedly old school in terms of recipe and pretty uninspired to me it has a very weird aftertaste chemicals and malt extract syrupy feel but with some bubbles too fine to try i guess as something new but i wont be back for more of this hoping the others in the lineup are better ill get around to trying them all eventually as a budget beer this might work for some in a certain context but smack in the middle of fresh hop season in northwest this is an embarrassment
253,Boatswain American IPA,1.94,wouldnt buy again for 56 pack give it to your guests you dont like
254,Boatswain American IPA,2.88,12oz can no date just a stupid code  hard pour big foam dark amber and cloudy some very pretty lacing left on the glass smells like rust water and alcohol tastes like heavy malts and aromatic bittering hops pine is the defining hop characteristic but theres not a ton of it this is mostly a malt bomb apart from the bitterness has that classic minhas brewery diacetyl butterscotch burnt bandaid aromataste as it warms it begins to taste worse and worse drink cold  this isnt for the westcoast hop heads  more of an oldhead classic representative of the style and at 5 a sixer how can you even begin to be critical
255,Boatswain American IPA,1,prominent hand sanitizer flavor with notes of old varnish  rancid malt not sure i even want to cook with this positive marks the can makes for good recycling
256,Boatswain American IPA,1.06,this is not an ipa  this tastes like someones first batch of homebrew and it was really warm where it fermented banana and clove in abundance
257,Kalamazoo Stout,4.25,only had it a few times but really pleasantly surprised
258,Kalamazoo Stout,3.83,bottled on 61520  poured at fridge temp and will let warm up into a tulip glass  pours a deep inky brown with a one finger sandy head  settles into about a 12 finger ultra tightly bubbled ring and a loose cap 4  at fridgeish temp i get some chocolate and associated sweetness and some malty body though i do get that rich black licorice taking a whiff off the bottle coffee roast aromas begin to rise as it warms up 4  roasted coffee dull but spicy hop presence and a hint of that black licorice offer a nice and pleasing if not unexpected flavor 375  light prickling carbo but otherwise a lighter body for a stout with nice lingering aftertaste and smooth finish 375  overall a fairly sessionable stout that is less filling than a nitrogood thing here and was impressive standalone though id imagine pairs great with the right meal 375
259,Kalamazoo Stout,3.64,very dark brown with kakhi foam smell is dark roasted malts flat and thin but mostly pleasant to sip on otherwise it packs a lot of flavor into 6 neither too bitter or too sweet but the hop and licorice combined leaves a sorta funky aftertaste
260,Kalamazoo Stout,4.46,first time with this stout i love dark beer in the winter in wyoming that means 6 months out of the year it seems this is a very pleasant stout very smooth and sessionable will buy more
261,Kalamazoo Stout,3.98,somehow kalamazoo stout is not among the 15 ive had previously from bells ive always like bells and probably have not written a microreview since the announced purchase by kirin interests a year ago i suppose i was waiting for something to happen but the purchase seems not to have changed bells and this is a very good thing because bells epitomized how crafters centered in and served their communities it actually seems to provide purpose to growth over time bells did and as it grew it took on new responsibilities most recently sustainability and dei i hope that continues and it is why i still give bells very good overall hugs  as for kalamazoo this follows the principle that if you dont try to do too much at first it improves your chances of eventually becoming a classic many american stouts fell off the extreme edge but kalamazoo continues and transcending the its strong licorice my taste memory said ive had this stout before havent i i suppose i have but it was not brewed by bells it was brewed by a micro imitating and inspired by kalamazoo and that is what makes kalamazoo a classic cheers 
262,Kalamazoo Stout,4,super roasty stout hits the sweet spot for a standard smokey malt and dry stout
263,Kalamazoo Stout,4.46,heavy chocolate and lactose notes almost like chocolate milk with some malty character black body with a brief flash of a dark beige head carbonated thick feel plentiful coffee notes in the after taste very proper stout that is pleasurable to sip some savoring of the beer lets out some of the licorice notes and it comes out a little bit more as it warms
264,Christmas Ale,4.5,a bit sweet a bit spicy quite carbonated
265,Christmas Ale,4.65,2022 release poured into chilled whisky chalice at 55degf  l pours dark with a finebubbled tan head that dissipates within a minute or so  s dark fruits malt caramel banana clove pear warmed s caramel and booze notes come out in full force with fruit receding  t surprising blood orange note mixed in with clove allspice caramel with boozy notes on the end reminiscent of cognac continued partaking sees a buildup of barrel aged flavors warmed t sweet dates mix with the blood orange spices recede somewhat  f mediumheavy mouthfeel that coats the tongue definitely a sipper that can stand without a food pairing satisfying to the palate on its own the texture clings in a way that layers on flavors as you continue to sip enhancing what comes through as almost a barrelaged taste although without the normal acridity you get from the tannins in barrelaged beers there is a light hopping that would cleanse the palate if drunk with food warmed f coats the palate less the longer you drink perhaps a buildup of the hops or a thinning as the beverage warms  o an excellent quad not too sweet thank god i wouldnt say it screams christmas but it is a spectacular trappist offering so glad i managed to get my hands on this beer feels stronger than 10 when youre near the end of it  it does make your breath smell christmasy
266,Christmas Ale,3.77,poured from an 112 oz can has a very dark brown color with a 12 inch head smell is of dark fruits light spices taste is dark fruits alcohol malts light spices feels mediumfull bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer

268,Christmas Ale,4.38,classic christmas ale lots of flavoured aromas that change with warmthi liked the cherry that popped out of the glass right off the bathigh abv so a real sippera perfect after dinner treat tho i got first taste beforepaired with a piece of stolen bacon from the kitchen and a sunset on the back deckperfect the salt and the sweetness of the ale contrasted beautifullyhighly recommended this is why the old world old school breweries are still top of the line in this category
269,Christmas Ale,3.53,clear copperapproachingrubycolored body with a creamy offtan head malty bready moderately sweet with some minor spices and earthyherbal notes some dark fruit characteristics typical of belgian quads smooth and sweet but really unremarkable to me

271,Berserker Imperial Stout,4.45,midnight black body with a tan shallow head roasted malts fill the nose but have molasses earth smoke and dark bitter chocolate supporting frankly i am in love with how rugged the flavor complexion is of this throw back stout roasted and earthy malt with accents of smoky coffee tobacco and earth meet dark chocolate and black strap molasses on the second half that just glob onto the palate taste is just that tick more intense while still being drinkable which brings me to the feel mirroring the taste strong roast but refined by the finish with the bright sweetness of the molasses robust yet smooth and quaffable
272,Berserker Imperial Stout,4.5,pours deep black color aroma is intense dark chocolate caramel coffee and booziness taste is a balance of the nose  bittervdark chocolate coffee and booze mouthfeel is perfectly full  overall an incredible stout

275,Berserker Imperial Stout,4.75,2012 vintage enjoyed 22021 first sip tasted of dark umami plum and rich dark chocolate deep dark fruit roasted malt char and has a mild bitterness
276,Aurelian Lure,4.45,169oz bottle for dating label includes the details of blend seven august 2022 cloudy apricot orange colored body no real lasting head no lacing aroma of apricot oak and rich funk of expresses horse blanket leather and hay taste is initially quite woody and herb bud like and then the sweetsour apricot comes in notes of lemon wash through along with the dry oak late is white wine the funk is very much of grass and hay after taste does not last very long but the essence of apricot lingers tart and drying mouth feel the teeth are scraped clean with each sip quiet carbonation the apricot expresses so naturally here and is the longest lasting flavor note the herb oak funk and lemon are worthy subordinates
277,Aurelian Lure,4.22,appearance pours a slightly hazy light amber color with a bubbly collar that fades away no lacing  smell bracingly sour funky with an apricot tone  taste a hint of apricot passes across the tongue and is followed by a strong funky character the apricot tone lingers underneath though after the swallow a bracing sourness emerges oaky dry and a lot of pucker in the finish  mouthfeel light to medium body no carbonation  overall not for the uninitiated aurelian lure harkens back to some of the tongue buckling sours that largely seem to have gone out of fashion these days
278,Aurelian Lure,4.26,brewed with apricots spontaneously fermented and allowed to ripen to full sour ale maturity youd think that this time honored way of beer making is rooted in the belly of brussels but nope its austin texas  aurelian lure is the lambiclike brainchild of jester king pouring with a pale and deep lemon yellow with a light golden center as the yeasty ale rises with a dainty champagne froth the jawtightening scent of citrus vinous and stone fruit carry the piquant tang of cider dusty funk and extended oak aged white wine as a scantly sweet taste briefly visit the tongue early impressions of wafers honey and sourdough offer a slim malt impact  a quick wash of acidity across the middle palate shows a quick erase of anything malty and an ushering in of sour apricot that stand proud above the other fruity complements of weathered lemon grapefruit lime and yuzu dried pineapple peach and white grape all continue to grow from the natural fermentae of the sour ale and play into a strikingly sour late palate of offvinegar mature and peppery acids that pang away on the sides of the tongue  light crisp succinct and highly refreshing the session is sweat inducing and tooth achingly sour to satisfy the taste for unblended lambic in the deep south as an afterglow of weathered woods wine rot and an overall mossy type of earthiness come in brief waves the aftertaste is otherwise short and concisely winey
279,Aurelian Lure,3.94,murky darker yellow body with a white cap smell blasts you with sour apricot backed by complex oak orange and farmhouse yeast taste is a cover up of the scandal the scandal you ask the apricot is wickedly acidic and pretty sour too this is then covered up by farmhouse yeast light barrel funk lemon and oak but for that moment when the scandal was alone on the palate it was rough very bright and sour funk is not impactful here oak is brightly so acidity builds as the secret wants to get out i love jk but this is the 15 wild ale in the world nah i wouldnt have this again
280,Aurelian Lure,4.46,pours a hazy golden color with a thin head that dissipates immediately the aroma is immediately noticeable with a strong scent of apricots and a subtle hint of oak upon tasting the apricot flavor dominates with a tartness that is balanced by a slight sweetness the oak barrel aging adds a layer of complexity imparting a mild vanilla flavor that complements the fruitiness of the apricots the beer finishes with a refreshing tartness that lingers on the tongue leaving a dry finish one of the standout features of aurelian lure is its balance despite being a sour ale the tartness is not overwhelming and is instead complemented by the sweetness of the apricots and the subtle oak notes this makes for a beer that is both complex and approachable with a flavor profile that is likely to appeal to both seasoned sour beer enthusiasts and those new to the style another noteworthy aspect of aurelian lure is its mouthfeel the beer is mediumbodied with a light carbonation which adds to the refreshing quality of the beer the combination of tartness and effervescence make this a perfect summer beer though its enjoyable yearround overall jester king brewerys aurelian lure is a fantastic sour ale that showcases the brewerys expertise in wild yeast and spontaneous fermentation its a beer that is both complex and approachable with a balanced flavor profile and a refreshing mouthfeel while it may be difficult to find due to its limited availability its certainly worth seeking out for any beer enthusiast looking to try something truly special
281,Aurelian Lure,4.13,bold sour with apricots wood mixed fermentation very good sipper
282,Fant√¥me Saison,4.25,pours gold with an average amount of head smells musty and funky and strong and you know this is gonna be bold for the style the taste is sour dry and a little bitter at first and then it opens up and you can taste lemon must a little grassy but a prominent distinctive flavor profile as saisons go this skews a little towards a sour but it has a few things going on that make it interesting and worth a try cheers
283,Fant√¥me Saison,4.16,rereviewing this one after 12 years since i last had it  750ml bottle best before end of 2025 into a tulip pours a clear golden color with a clean bright head lively carbonation  wow the funky aroma on this is pungent all the usual descriptorsbarnyard wet hay maybe even dank weedcome immediately to mind super strong but not offputting at all just a precursor to the unique flavor in store  taste is not surprisingly funky and strong super dry kind of like orval on steroids grassy acidic with a subtle crushedaspirin finish the pale malt and unique yeast strain compete for dominance unified by bitter old world hops noble hallertauer saaz no idea  mouthfeel is dominated by the lively carbonation that bites at the palate but gives each sip or gulp a crisp clean finish maybe mouthfeel is where this beer excels mostits just so refreshing like champagne  overall this is just a unique special beer maybe not one id go for every day and at about 23 iirc i couldnt afford to but this one is different from any other saison out thereits simply the most saisony saison on the market _____________________  previous review preserved for posterity 7222011  4445 rdev 42 look 35  smell 45  taste 45  feel 45  overall 45 750ml bottle lot no bc best before jan 2013  thanks tai4ji2x  poured into a hennepin glass watching a replay of le tour de france from earlier today col du galibier and alpe dhuez  happy belated belgian independence day  slightly hazy straw color with a 1finger head very minimal carbonation  like almost zero huh  aroma is typical saison funk apples pears grass and pepper nice and bright  taste is very dry and clean  almost like a white wine lots of fresh fruit especially white grapes not picking up any belgian yeasty mustiness just a dry champagne sweetness with a lot fewer bubbles  mouthfeel is slick oily just great  now as i get toward the bottom of the second full glass im picking up a bretty tartness  maybe if id cellared this for a year or so there would be more of this  this saison is extremely drinkable the only disappointment is the near total lack of carbonation but even that does not significantly detract from the experience  its hard to believe this beer was made with barley and not grapes it really blurs the line between beer and wine like nothing else ive tried
284,Fant√¥me Saison,3.89,more of a dry sour saison not bad but a little sweeter would have pleased this palate more
285,Fant√¥me Saison,4.35,poured into a gulden draak tulip pours a lightly hazy medium orangegold with a four finger white head with great retention and thick lacing looks nice aroma of grainy malt saison yeast coriander lemon and mild summer herbs flavor follows with grainy malt saison yeast with a little funk coriander lemon a touch of honey apple hints of light stone fruit some moderate farmhouse funk in the finish medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess a great full flavored saison hits all the basics of the style in yeast light fruit grain and yeast funk in addition there are wisps of interesting dried fruit and citrus great flavor progression with coriander and grain up front and fruit developing over time finishing with a drier farmhouse funky bite dupont saisons are my benchmark for this style and this is as fine or better this is a really great brewery so glad they are available again sporadically in our area

290,Expedition Stout,4.59,i cant believe i havent reviewed this one yet had at least 10 bottles of this over the past few years bottled 91421 just about two years old a perfect aging  the pour yields a thin line of dark brown foam it quickly fades leaving a ring around the glass  nose is right down the middle russian imperial material roasted malt brings notes of dark chocolate dark fruits brown sugar and the slightest bit of soy sauce you can tell that this brew will be incredibly animated just from a first glance  taste follows through but bringing even more roasted malt smokiness dark chocolate dark fruit slight caramel brown sugar or perhaps even black strap molasses wonderful stuff the bitterness on this one is just perfect reaching high points but never overwhelming or obtrusive the flavors still fly true almost urged onward by the bitterness them working in tandem everything working together to create the final product  mouthfeel is fullbodied almost pillowy has heft and density to it with just the slightest bit of cloying very mild carbonation the mouthfeel delivers the flavor perfectly  overall this is easily one of the best russian imperials you can buy in eternal cellared stout beer fridge staple material along the likes of sierra nevadas barrel aged narwhal old rasputin and founders imperial stout a brew that demands respect

293,Expedition Stout,4.36,bottled 9722 debated waiting til the one year mark but you can all see how that went  poured into a nh to tulip at fridge temp and warming up  pours dark brown nearly black with a dark mocha head 425  lots of dark and fermented stone fruit on the initial nose whiff smidge of coffee and cocoa 45  taste follows boozy bitter more hoppy than coffee dark fruit and heavy 425  body is thick boozy warm heat syrupy and heavy everything id expect from a ris 425  overall a true ris if ive ever had one with the perfect amount of butter hops and deep complexity 45

296,Expedition Stout,4.32,deep black pour with a small brown ring that is hanging around roasted malt nose with a decent amount of ethanol super smooth perfectly equal creamy and a bit of carbonation delicious classic stout

300,Expedition Stout,4.54,due to abv split this 12 ozer with my son in law dark dark dark in color exceptional taste up front and nothing weird on the finish abv disguised so well its crushable but at your own peril will cellar one or two from this sixer well priced at 1600 for six
301,Starry Noche,4.45,a  pours a syrupy thick deep dark brown with a ton of coconut floaties no real head to speak of heavy amount of sludgy lacing  s  aroma is dark chocolate oak and huge barrel notes  t  the taste is dark chocolate coconut hazelnut and tons of barrel  m  full body with medium carbonation syrupy thick mouthfeel with a slick drying finish  o  top notch
302,Starry Noche,4.75,2022 version poured from a 169oz bottle into a snifter this beer is wonderfully thick probably the best toasted coconuthazelnut flavor i recall having in quite some time
303,Starry Noche,4.9,166 impressed
304,Starry Noche,4.54,big bold flavors chocolate forward coconut is there as well plenty of barrel presence slight thickness nothing oily or syrupy or slick at all booze is subtle really good
305,Starry Noche,4.28,thanks to texasfan549 for this 500ml bottle which looks like a medianoche work of art split with no one mine  standard medianoche pour dense black no head but hey this one has tiny flecks of coconut floating in it always like that nose meets expectations dark deep malts coconut barrel good  starry noche is thick but you knew that its full of raw coconut flavor but it says that right on the bottle big sweet malts but hey imperial stout am i right and barrels which is in smaller type amid a 121 word description of the beer the bourbon is swinging low the rye is bringing a small dose of spiciness nary a trace of booziness which is impressive  means that oneme could drink a full 500ml without blinking i am still blinking like a leaf tailed gecko  one of the better of the pantheon nothing subtle about this big bad stout excellent brew
306,Storm King,4.47,poured from 12ounce bottle into a tulip glass pours black as a moonless night with a thick foamy tan head that showed great retention and beautiful sheets of lacing as it receded lightly herbaceous aroma and lots of hoppy bitterness up front aromas and flavors of roasted malt espresso bean dark chocolate and char satisfying mouthfeel with a mostly dry finish and lots of char lingering on the palate the alcohol is well hidden among the bold characteristics of this beer delicious and highly recommended
307,Storm King,4.05,12 oz botle into a snifter pours midnight black tan foam good lacing smell is deep dark cacao dark toast malt cuban coffee almost burnt malt taste goes dark chocolate rich espresso a fine bold hop zing on the side of the tongue thats unexpected feel is medium carb medium body medium slick not syrupy at all overall this is a good little stout with no barrel required
308,Storm King,3.96,im really late to the game on grading this  l pitch black color  s roasted dark malt slight smoky smell  t dark chocolate almost cocoa flavor  f decent mouthfeel  o great unadulterated imperial stout
309,Storm King,4.44,poured this into a glass poured out a ritch and dark black with a hop malt and slight chocolatey smell the taste was different to me since this is my introduction to this type of beer and it wasnt quite what i was expecting the abv 91 is apparent and the added hop flavor is just right i like it and will be having it again for sure
310,Storm King,4.16,poured from a botle dated bb 102222 into the test glass a  solid black color excellent tan tight knit froth lacing with each draw s  bakers chocoalte char a bit of espresso pine t  again with the bakers chocolate add a hint of orange rime and piney coffee with flourless chocoalate cake m  medium in body start is semi sweet then rolls toward and stays on the bitter side finish is ashen dry o  a new favorite for me assertive edgy and with all the pieces of an american ris thankful to have this in our area
311,Storm King,4,pours dark tan foam malty aroma big hop body fades to a malty goodness bitter finish im surprised how hoppy it is good balance of malt and hops this ones a classic
312,Storm King,3.86,look pours like black coffee with a nice tan head with great retention sticky foam lace on the glass taste and smell strong espresso notes with a hint of chocolate somewhat bitter feel a full mouth oiliness going on overall pretty good coffee imperial shout
313,Storm King,4.02,from the 12 oz bottle in a snifter this classic pours a dark blackish brown with a fantastic head of khaki foam that settles to a thick fat layer with excellent lacing nose of dark cocoa pine touched hops dark coffee and moderate char flavors follow the nose nicely with dark bakers cocoa char coffee and floral as well as pine touched hops on the rear nice mouth feel medium full body smooth lightly creamy and finishing with a char and bitter malt note balanced by strong hops  overall a solid brew a touch more hops than i remember but solid all the same  cheers
314,Storm King,3.94,victory storm king is a well balanced stout with elements of malt roasted malt and hoppy bitterness the 91 alcohol content is well hidden the flavor is more assertive than a guinness stout nitro i recently tasted a carlow ohara stout that was more aggressively flavored than storm king even having half the alcohol content all things being equal id prefer to drink two of the oharas than just one storm king
315,Storm King,3.89,pours an opaque deep dark black with a creamyfoamy mocha colored head deep roasted nuttinessalmost peanut butter scent taste is smoky coffeeespresso even more dark chocolatefeels full bodied with enough carbonationfinishes dank and chewy overall this is a stout that lets you know its a stout an above average hop presence
316,Storm King,4.37,label says best by oct 22 2022 interesting since an imperial stout can get better with age reviews ive read lead me to expect something different in the nose but the sweet dark candy smell betrays nothing about this being any different from any other impy stout the opaque blackness topped with a thin offwhite foam also seem normal the only deviation is the additional bitterness of the hops which only appear to me in the taste rather than in the smell its noticably drier than id expect and the alcohol is well hidden hops dominate later in the taste its a nice change but to me a minor flourish rather than a major deviation from the style the mouthfeel is light but chewy overall very nice and at a comfortable price point for an imperial stout
317,Storm King,4.29,l jet black tan head with moderate lacing  s herbal hops up front with a sweet roasted malt and vanilla back drop  t strong citrus and herbal hoppy flavors with some chocolate and char moderate to strong bitter  t medium body medium carbonation  o well balanced very good beer i would almost consider this a black ipa though
318,Storm King,4.13,pours black with a nice light brown head not much retention but a nice thin layer of creamy light brown persists  citrus hops dark chocolate dark fruit and dark roast black coffee  very much similar to the nose the hops really show a grapefruit citrus without any of the sweet the coffee also really shows on the finish  full body moderate to low carbonation a hint of alcohol nice big bitterness
319,Storm King,4.1,pours a near black color with a small shortlived tan head and light lacing  smells and tastes of toasted malt and coffee sips are lightly bitter from start to finish  medium body with light carbonation clean dry mouthfeel  this is a good imperial stout that probably would mellow well with some age
320,Storm King,4.42,12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass looks dark brown to black with a khaki head that falls off to a thin cap smell is a nice mix of dark malt roasted coffee cocoa and a bit of bright floral hops taste starts with roast malt a bit of fruit raspberry hops in the middle i get some bitterness from the hops more fruit and a cocoa powder flavor finish is hoppy cocoa powder and coffee very balanced between sweet and bitter mouth feel is mediumfull rather soft and creamy even with a tight carbonation present the alcohol is hidden pretty well overall im glad they brought this back for some reason i always passed this one up years ago this is a great stout and a nice change of pace from the barrel aged and super sweet stouts that dominate
321,Pale Ale,3.75,a classic
322,Pale Ale,3.57,12 oz can acclimated to 49f and poured into a nonic pint  pours a nice clear copper with a 253 finger seafoamy barely off white head leaving little leaving  initial aroma is caramel malt a little pine and really nothing else after agitating i kind of just get a general grainy smell smells good just simple  initial taste before swallowing is very sweet with a cereal grain undertone and a dry hop presence after swallowing i get more of all of the previous with the hops being bitter and dry and seemingly growing in bitterness as i enter the aftertaste its not terribly bitter but the intensity is high  mouthfeel is smooth and goes down easily the carbonation fades somewhat quickly but can be conjured for a short duration through agitation it lends a pleasant creaminess through its small bubbles  overall its solid just simple limited flavor notes in addition to a smooth mouthfeel but a relatively strong bitterness make for an ale thats easy but not too fast to drink would make for a good beer for when you want to not think or when you want to think want to turn your brain off drink something simple want to think about something drink something that doesnt require much thought  may buy again not something i would go out of my way for though if its cheap ill consider it
323,Pale Ale,4.04,a perfect 90 no higher no lower a solid for its category with a very long and pleasant finish
324,Pale Ale,4.05,really really good not aggressively hoppy nice malt character fine pale ale
325,Pale Ale,3.43,a decent beer although much too bitter for my liking i prefer a smoother bite overall 255 on my palette once you get a couple in you it is much less bitter though i will adjust my overall rating to 40 overall as a standard beer its a nice stronger beer if your not drunk its a 25 in taste if you have a couple in you its at least a 40 these are the facts of life its just the way it works god bless
326,Pale Ale,4.02,poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass  appearance orangeish golden in color large creamy barelyoffwhite head that lingered long leaving abundant lacing  nose pine with a slight hint of floral  mouthfeel lightmedium  attack lightlytoasted malt grassy citrus the tiniest bit of caramel provides depth  finish the hop bitterness comes through strong but not too aggressively  overall i must admit to approaching this beer with more than a bit of reverence honoring its status as a longstanding statesman among craft beers im not a hophead so neither pale ales nor ipas are my gotos this beer however is worthy of its status and is an ale id be proud to serve and drink with food pairings that scream out pale ale
327,Pale Ale,3.9,pours beautifully dark amber with a generous frothy head slight notes of pine florals and citrus but fairly subtle on the nose full taste though bursts of fresh florals grapefruit citrus and hops really enjoyable classic pale ale
328,Pale Ale,4.07,poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass  look pale amber mildly hazy visible small particulate off white creamy head average head retention and lacing  smell bready grassy pine grapefruit medium strength of scent  taste bready earthy pine grapefruit moderately bitter medium strength of flavor  feel medium body average carbonation moderately bitter highly creamy  overall pale amber and mildly hazy with average head retention and lacing bouquet was malt forward with notes of pine and grapefruit the flavor followed the nose well and was medium in strength feel was medium body with moderate bitterness and highly creamy overall this was a solid pale ale that provided a nice drinking experience but other than mouthfeel it was only slightly above average
329,Pale Ale,4.4,finally leaving this one a review after all these years  pours pale with some hints of orange slightly off white head ok retention but always great lacing when poured semi aggressively  nose is an aromatic combination of light floral with some pine mixed in the malt is nicely present very very lightly toasted in nature  taste is nicely hoppy and balanced a very nice malt ever so lightly toasty backbone that carries all the pine and grass from the hops  light to medium body very pleasing carbonation it has a softness too it finishes with a dry and piney bitter and grassy bite  the balance of this beer is always impressive to me it has a unique malt presence and pairs so nicely with the hops
330,Kellerweis,3.87,i think their label got it right on the nose our bavarianstyle wheat beer is complex with flavors reminiscent of banana bread and spicy clove this hazygolden beer glows with suspended yeast creating a velvety texture and refreshing finish this is one of the few beers where the label is spot on very much so enjoy the banana bread flavor going on as well as the very smooth finish
331,Kellerweis,3,rerate 355 ml bottle cardinal pub  bar stavanger i turned the bottle upside down before opening hazy yellow colour small white head of poor retention the aroma has notes of citrus and less pronounced notes of cloves and banana there are also some less pleasant hints of solvent the flavour is also citrussy with moderate notes of banana and cloves fizzy mouthfeel  original rating 355 ml bottle at peter gift aarhus denmark deep golden colour no head at all in the shiny glass probably due to the pubs ignorant use of rinse aid  rinse agent the aroma and flavour have some of the typical notes of a hefeweizen banana and cloves but this beer was far from the best hw ive had and i love hefeweizens fizzy mouthfeel
332,Kellerweis,4.58,very good american hefeweisse
333,Kellerweis,4.08,as white beers go this is a good one a summertime treat with diverse flavor notes a great showing by sierra nevada who is more known for their ipas
334,Kellerweis,4.47,on tap at beer mule l hazy golden creamy head s bananas in a wheat field t banana clove wheat breadbubblegumfruit maybe some very mild german hops f fairly full and crisp overall so good for style this could pretty much substitute for any sunny day easy drinking beer in the world

336,Anabasis,4.65,appearance  the beer was almost black in appearance with some variation in color and little carbonation  smell  the nose was composed of the barrel and dark fruits it lean toward the sweet side  taste  the bourbon barrel was strong with this one but not hot notes of port fruit leather tobacco cherries and oak were present needless to say it was a diverse pallet the port and oak notes really stood out this was a sipper  mouthfeel  the body was not overly thick especially when judged to todays outrageous standards carbonation was muted  overall  this is an elite barleywine
337,Anabasis,4.65,blend 5 thanks to luscious_malfoy for hooking me up with this bottle so the appearance is not a looker sludgy brown body no head but the rest of this beer is breathtaking big rich and complex rustic bourbon barrel barley toasted caramel tons of dark fruit rye molasses char black licorice vanillins and leather nose taste is similar adds slight anise no licorice and char though oxidized sugars with attached earthiness vanillins emerge over time more feel is thick and warm with great barrel character barley splashes on the palate in such a smooth way luxurious and complex though heavy met the hype
338,Anabasis,4.63,blend 5 poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip perfectly sweet nicely thick this ranks up their with some of the best revolution bw in my opinion

353,The Great Pumpkin,4.57,liquid pumpkin pie with smell and flavor exactly in line with the label description pumpkin cinnamon nutmeg cloves and allspice heavier body than i expected but very nice glean finish score is only diminished by the suspended solids but at least the label warns that they might be present

355,The Great Pumpkin,3.33,aroma is practically nonexistent faint pumpkin spice the body is pretty much solely pumpkin with some spice baking it up satisfying body very spiced and nice carbonation yup its pumpkin
356,The Great Pumpkin,4.4,one of the best beers i have had well balanced and not too strong on the flavors will buy again and again tastes like a pumpkin with the right combination of spices
357,The Great Pumpkin,3.85,light amber thin white head ok retention splotchy lace smells like pumpkin spice light toasty and caramel malt underneath pumpkin spice can actually taste pumpkin a bit of caramel malt medium bodied and appropriately carbonated still heavy on the spice but the best so far out of this mixed pack

360,Modelo Especial,3.27,lookcopper but closer to gold with a quickly dissolving white head completely clear smellthe lightest of hints of the hop citrus and wheat a wave of fresh grass tastereminiscent to me of a german pils but a little bit maltier and not as dry on the finish a pillow like resolve at the end with some sweetness feelsmooth and thin with a proper amount of carbonation giving an easy drinking overalli would not buy this too many times a year but i dont buy many non craft pilsners at all sooit is great on a hot day and some good eats  great vacation beer or staycation  i gotta be honest these are cooler dwellers from vacaso gifted cheers
361,Modelo Especial,3.61,this is the best beer you can buy at 7eleven it has a decent amber color and it tastes good like beer its fairly smooth without an unpleasant aftertaste its a step above your average adjunct lager when im tired of the heaviness of stouts and the bitterness of ipas i enjoy a glass of this beer it reminds me of when i was young having a beer with my dad or drinking with my friends
362,Modelo Especial,3,appearance  taste is according to style with a slight metallic flavor overall it tastes pretty good for the style
363,Modelo Especial,3.46,look crystal clear dark yellow and my pour kicks off a tornado in the glass that doesnt stop and helps build a great head that settles to a lid leaving decent lacing behind aroma cereal grains floral hops soda crackers some pilsner malt and a little lightstruck skunk note taste grains pilsner malt and crackers join forces on the initial hit and are quickly followed by strongerthanexpected floral hop notes malt and hops trade off throughout the middle and on the close floral hops finish on top mouthfeel light but not too watery clean mediumhigh carbonation and crisp and clean on the finish overall i dig it outside of victoria and negra modelo this is my favorite mexican chela and top dog if im going for the pilsneresque style of mexican lager more flavorful than others to me and a good floral hops presence for a macro keep me coming back whenever the calling comes  evening bbq work party fishing camping hot weather chilling etc fun to slow down and finally review it
364,Modelo Especial,3.75,12oz bottle duvel tulip best by september 2023  well well well the most popular beer in america it does look nice middle gold with a decent white head  corn sweetness faint grain husk and surprisingly i do get the orange blossom honey a little alcohol too  very neutral grain honeycorn sweetness light herbal bitterness  moderate body and carbonation  its definitely a macro lager though its got more flavor and body than say bud light ive rated it to style not my preferences
365,Modelo Especial,2.95,i am rating this for the style the style being an americanmexican regular type lager beer this beer is more dry than id like it isnt special at all its smells like beer but sorta in a bad way like what i remember beer to smell like when i was in college id definitely drink this if it was offered to me however i dont think i will be buying it again because i prefer other beers from similar companies nothing wrong with this beer its just a bit dry and the flavor is of corn and raw dough
366,Modelo Especial,3.4,pours very light straw color crystal clear quick bubbly white head forms and then just as quick as it came it is gone there is minimal retention just some white splotches here and there and a translucent ring eventually these too fade to nothing  nose interesting to me combination of an astringent like sweetness some mineral or metallic character stale white bread touch of hops  taste is lightly creamy and sweet watered down with some slight metallic character on the fnish there is a noticeable generic hop presence that shows itself more in feel that taste  light body nicely effervescent and actually quite smooth and easy to drink mild sweetness low bitterness dry but as stated above a little lingering sweet remains
367,Carta Blanca,3.3,from a quart bottle best by jan 2024 clear golden color with a thin layer of white head straw and grainy smell with some caramel medium body heavier than many mexican lagers caramel and a funky corn note followed by floral and grassy bitterness actually not bad yes its a macro and the corn adjunct is a loveitorhateit thing
368,Carta Blanca,3.69,on tap at la peralita in a frosted pint glass pours a clear yellow color with a white head  smell is grain malt and citrus  taste has pale malts lemon bread malts  mouth feel is this quenchable went well with the heat from the food
369,Carta Blanca,2.55,poured from 16oz can into a tumbler  appearance light golden hue with no haze and a ton of effervescence head is a finger of white foam that dissipated quickly  smell malty and grainy with a rather a bit of adjunct character not awful but not great either  taste adjuncts malt almost a little sourness honestly its not wonderful  mouthfeel mediumlight body with a reasonable carbonation not really creamy but its fine  overall there are worse macro lagers out there but this isnt a wonderful beer
370,Carta Blanca,3.03,poured from a 32oz bottle best by apr 2023  on the pour a 3 finger white head forms with some light fizziness after a while the head dissipates to a more fizzy rocky 1 finger head fine plentiful carbonation in a golden yellow body for the style head retention is pretty nice  aroma is old and almost skunky in the hops corn is present and lager character is quite present a very mexican import aroma despite that it is full bodied while maintaining a lighter and refreshing presence high carbonation while still being quite smooth and a nice dinner beer  overall this is pretty good but there are a few off notes traditional cervesa corny flavors and a bit of that corona like skunk but a bit more rich and sweet than a lot of light mexican beers  taste is light and cervesa like with the skunky off note gone on the palate almost entirely until there is a faint note of it on the very end the main flavor of this is corny crackery malts with a slight sweetness this beer is not very bitter but would be quite good on a beach with canitas tacos and lime  feel is bigger than a lot of other pale mexican lagers decently long finish from the malt and somewhat full bodied while maintaining
371,Carta Blanca,2.14,i had this beer with some pasole at gabriels near santa fe poured from a bottle into a tall half pint glass clear yellow color with a good white head with decent lacing faint hint of corn in the smell and taste a bit of citrus not much taste overall just thought i would give it a try
372,Carta Blanca,2,i have to admit it went down nicely on a hot baja afternoon but really nothing but a refresher
373,Carta Blanca,4.1,dont know if its just me but this tastes worse every time i have it far from the worst beer from the gas stationbodega though lol
374,Carta Blanca,2,this is like the miller of mexico miller light its definitely corny slightly sweet much lighter than you would expect i mean thats all there is to say without the import markup it would be right next to the cans of light and ice beer we know and love its fun to explore new stuff that rolls in to the gas station but if its rollin in there i really shoulda known better
375,Carta Blanca,5,8 oit of 10 stars does anybody like don chelada cups√± they are the best combo ever in the world i was ptainet patient lord and behold it was the best thing i drink and the only vice i wish i had lol jk im chicano  love this c√®rveza with the deepest depths of my heart to be honest

377,Reaction State,4.9,150 yummy
378,Reaction State,4.5,2022 version poured from a 169oz bottle into a plastic cup my day 12 beer for bottle logic 12 days of christmas nice thickness excellent blend of vanilla maple and coffee
379,Reaction State,3.5,cinnamon is becoming my kryptonite so im hoping its been used with an appropriately light touch in this 500ml bottle cause i like everything else added to this brute  hard black with a few stray brown bubbles that quiet swiftly oh oh cinnamon bite is strong on the nose please no brew deities  reaction state tiptoes along the abyss of cinnamon gorge cinnamon is straddling the beer but doesnt quite crush it into submission underneath the spice are touches of maple vanilla  the ghost of cocoas past light bourbon winds its way betwixt  between  the finish is mulled apple cider should have split this one with my wife  hey brewers quit putting so much fucking cinnamon in your beers if you cant get the balance right throw the crap away pretty good beer which is sad as i can sense something really good underneath the cinnamon avalanche
380,Reaction State,4.57,pours a dark brown like motor oil just a half of a finger of dark brown head shows up and disappears just as quickly  nose is a walloping of bourbon barrel aged stout its got that rich dense still wet barrel level of intensity huge oak profile i love it next is the roasted malt and a strong presence of chocolate this reminds me a little of one of my favorites of all time weyerbachers chocolate pretzel sunday morning stout then in the background there lies the cinnamon  taste is much of the same on the nose oak bourbon roasted malt chocolate cinnamon but now i get the slight bit of maple syrup maple syrup presents almost with i hesitate to say this but a sour note when its put in stouts sometimes like an extremely subtle tartness or tanginess it doesnt detract but it is a unique quality the tannins from the barrel kind of leave that soapy flavor that also sometimes tends to happen in these barrel aged stouts its incredibly mild and doesnt linger but thats why i decided to put it at a 45 rather than 475 similar to the nose  mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth brief flash of carbonation right at the beginning abv makes its presence known but not as severely as that maumasi i had the other night there is a little bit of drying but not harsh on the palate or on the way down  overall my favorite bottle logic brew so far i was surprised because i though this was just going to be another breakfast stout but this one actually blew me away well balanced and all the flavors work well with each other and dont feel like novelty additions masterclass level stuff
381,Reaction State,4.54,opaque midnight black pour with a finger of brown foam smells of big coffee and maple forward nose with vanilla chocolate and molasses accents taste is incredible hype meeting even coffee rich dark chocolate molasses and the difference lush bourbon before vanilla cinnamon and bigger maple elevate to a finish with espresso biscotti and a lingering caramel nougat lush rich smooth full and decently thick with good barrel warmth and coffee percolation
382,Tsingtao Pure Draft,2.92,look  golden in color lots of fizziness that fully dissipates quickly leaving virtually no lacing smell  distinct asian adjunct lager slightly sweet spicy and some grassy hops not super interesting but not bad taste  sweetness indicating considerable rice and comes with a light hoppy bite towards the end with a slightly malty finish its watery but the flavors are there feel  as light bodied as it can get high carbonation and not very boozy so the 48 is probably an overestimate overall  one of the most commonly found beers across china and the pure draft is even more popular than the flagship given its refreshingness people do drink it like water as such i have some very fond memories with this beerscore reflects just a little bit of sentimentality

398,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4.12,im probably ranking this too low for the style but a bit too much for me choosing to sit down with this is akin to skipping another cocktail rather than a beer boozy thickness throughout warms the chest just a bit to syrupy for me

407,Cerveza Cristal,1.47,seems to be a cheap knockoff labatt or it seems to be nothing special or worth noting very bland and relatively flat
408,Cerveza Cristal,2.25,you can say what you want about this beer it is not the greatest of beers by a long shot however it is certainly a great beach beer and i am drinking the hell out of it while i sit on a cuban beach
409,Cerveza Cristal,3.34,drank my moneys worth of this stuff while in cuba for 8 days  serving type can bottle and draught  l pours a bright hay yellow topped by a 12 finger fluffy white head half decent retention great for an aal  s faint aroma of pale grain corny sweetness and a slight grassy hopiness nothing bad here just nothing particularly noteworthy  t same as the smell very mild flavours of grain and a grassy hoppiness  f light body and fairly high carbonation refreshing would be a solid descriptor  o compared to most aals this brew is fantastic it doesnt have anything offputting and doesnt really have much to offer refreshing and cheap if i make it to cuba again you can bet ill be putting back some cristal on the beach
410,Cerveza Cristal,2.89,had countless cans of this as well as on tap samples while away in cuba for a week served cold into a pilsner glass  appearance pale golden color clear with plenty of carbonation a small cap of white head is poured and sometimes lingers  smell  not a lot here some faint graininess in general and no off aromas so thats a plus  taste  again not a lot of flavor light grassy flavors and a hint of grain with nothing offputting  mouthfeel  smooth and watery light bodied with just enough crisp carbonation to make things interesting  overall  while not a great beer it really does hit the spot and when laying on a beach or poolside for hours under the hot cuban sun a beer that very much can get some positive ratings due to the memories it invokes for what it is it is quite good dos cervezas por favor
411,Cerveza Cristal,2.16,355ml can in santa clara cuba 30 pesos quite a basic  fairly poor lager but not unlike what i was expecting going in really  at least it wasnt offensive or offputting there was a few skunky touches early on but for the most part the beer featured the usual corn hay  basic adjunct flavours but not much else it was easy to drink throughout though probably due to the heat in cuba  as such i cant imagine its one id have again if i were in the uk  it was more readily available here

413,Cable Car Kriek,3.16,2021 vintage ruby red body with surprisingly little carbonation and no head whatsoever aromas are pretty standard kriek cherry pie lemon hay bit of vinegar very little funk which is a bit unusual flavors are acetic but also semisweet with predominant notes of cherry and apple cider vinegar feel is slippery and a bit flat due to the low carbonation overall i think this is one of those beers that made waves upon release when the idea of belgian lambics was still relatively unknown in the us but now that we have broader access to some of the best belgium offerings here in the states it doesnt quite hold up especially given the price point 90750ml i would not buy this again but happy to have the opportunity  64100

415,Cable Car Kriek,4.28,2021 vintage  gorgeous ruby red pour very few agitated bubbles of carbonation as its poured into the glass it settles flat  the nose is still distinctly cable car with noticeable yet restrained funk and lemony citrus the cherry adds more brightness and is a fresh fruity addition with time a lot of oak and brett comes to the forefront  the palate is sour and noticeably acidic with a surprisingly low carbonation was definitely hoping for more of it to cut that tart cherry and acid but overall its never overwhelming the tannin from the cherry works really well with the overall profile  as stated above not sure if that much carb was lost since 2021 or it was just never very high but i felt it needed more that said it drinks bright and refreshing with restrained tannin

419,Fourth Dementia (4D),4.14,2013 vintage consumed on 292022  pours a clear deep ruddy chestnut brown body capped with a slight finger of fluffy offbeige foam solid head retention leaves a thin layer of intermittent cap a thin creamy collar and virtually no lacing holding to the walls of the glass  aroma is entirely dominated by and centered around twangy raisin coursing throughout an underlying dusting of bakers chocolate details figgy esters and faded caramels over time while an increasingly luscious and jammy raisin holds focus  taste opens to raisin juice accented with toasted fig burnt black bread and molasses with distant chocolate and wisps of nutty undertones progressing to the midpalate as dark fruit jam peaks brown sugar born from a residual sweetness phases into intermittent booziness amplifying subtler dark fruit esters as they linger through the finish  mouthfeel features a rounded medium body with a composed moderatehigh carbonation lively yet rounded while dispersing to slick semisyrupy even textures over the midpalate and eventually drying as a distant char balances a moderate warmth through the finish  approaching a decade in the bottle this old ale has refined and embraced an undeniably onenote character sparking depth through sheer focus on a singular profile development to showcase a concentrated display of age across a quality base an increasingly decadent sipper by way of a stalwart longevity
420,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1.33,mountain crest you were once a good reliable cheap beer i used to always have a case of you ready for the weekend was it the contracts with liquor depot was it because they dropped the price ubsurdly low were you dealing with high demand issues and somewhere somehow quality control went out the window come back i miss you  seriously used to be the best bang for buck beer on the market now its swill utter swill this is my third attempt at revisiting a lost loved one never again goodbye mc thanks for the memories
421,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1.4,crap beer can u even call it beer  bad mouth feel bad pours  sickly smell these taste like apples in a bad way and taste like rubbing alcohol most minhas products are to be stayed away from ive had one good drink by them haha   infected ass beer
422,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,4.03,i am an avid drinker of this in 355ml cans it is not the best beer out there but such an underrated local beer at a fair price  look light goldenyellow body head doesnt last long  smell citrus malt apple  taste  citrus sweet apple crisp sour tangy after taste that activates the back end of the tongue  feel  light coats the pallet for a shot time crisp  overall a great summer beer that is easily drinkable not watery not skunky very well priced if youre local
423,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1,this is disgusting  the worst beer ive ever opened it smells like apple cider vinegar and tastes like it  i threw out an 8 pack because it was so disgusting
424,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,3.57,drank from a 12 ounce can scores are based on the style  look  very busy but kind of charming it has a sort of simple 90s aesthetic to it its not the most beerlooking but i like it  smell  sweet and malty very powerful smell for an adjunct lager smells more like a german dunkel almost a good smell but on the verge of overpowering  taste  the taste more or less follows the smell very sweet very bready somewhat of a caramel taste could use with some more bitterness to tone it down but its got a character that ive never experienced in this style  feel  a weird creamysoapy texture not entirely pleasant could definitely use with a bit more carbonation  overall  never heard of this beer and have only seen it in one random store but for a 3 sixpack this was a good pick way more interesting than most other adjunct lagers might come back to it if i can find it again
425,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.25,just a beer 20100906
426,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1.57,12oz can coded 17 285 19 poured into a perfect pint at fridge temp beer is bright straw yellow with minimal white head and no lacing even the perfect pint with a nucleation point could only keep a head on this a few minutes aroma is an odd mix of malt and chemical taste normal for an adjunct lager but there is a bad lingering bitter after taste that is not hop driven mouthfeel is poor with sharp carbonation and a burning sensation to the tongue after swallowing there is a thick persistent oilysoapy feeling that doesnt go away overall this beer is flawed at the basics i was hoping for a cheap lawnmower beer but this is not okay even judged only against other aal
427,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,3.43,barely drinkable but not bad after a hot lawn mowing session
428,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.69,a typical grainy blonde lager pour with a surprising soapy and foamy head of three fingers haze is present in fact it bumps the opacity to near 30  smells of cheerios or other breakfast cereal cut bananas and malty grain actually an excellent nose  holy sweetness batman its like someone dumped sugar in my beer the banana runt flavor is there which i like but then it turns cloyingly bad with lumps of sugar and malt mix a pine stab very faintly finishes out the profile but it barely pushes through the overwhelming sweetness in this beer notes of banana linger through the end  creamy yet still carbonated but nothing exceptional a little sticky in a bad way ends wet  overall this beer was way too sweet i dont think i could do two of these in a row someone who drinks the 24 packs it comes in is probably prediabetic ive had fruit beers less sweet than this
429,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.53,sampled last night on 91015 comes in a 12ounce can that i paid 99 cents from no frills on wednesday can chilled down to 36 degrees f in my beer cooler and poured in to a handledglass stein cheersboston glass  brew pours a deepgolden yellow in color with a good 1finger foamycreamy head decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped aroma is of sweet grain for the most part pretty much is said for the taste with lots of sweetness i am guessing from the grain they used too much actually funny that several times on the can they mention craft brewed in small batches with a website with the three ws followed by damngoodbeer dot com wellok then lol gonna say they they must like their own craft brewed in small batches better than myself and many others with all the comments here anyway just a one time try for me for sure mediumbodied with good carbonation
430,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.68,cheap but tolerable malt liquor love how they plaster craft brewed all over the can as if any beer enthusiast would confuse the wisconsin minhas brewery label with a craftbrewed beer especially with the boisterous damngoodbeercom website on the can as well not at all bad very drinkable and if it came in glass 40oz bottle i couldnt make the promise id never buy it again
431,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.68,pours golden with a thin white head that has decent retention some lacing sticks  the smell is of an average cheap macro lager something raw in the smell though  the taste is of grain chemical and alcohol  the feel is slick with solvent alcohol it does have a certain crispness to it though  for 3 a sixpack i figured that i would try it its worth spending just a little more for miller high life in my opinion this reminds me of a cheap malt liquor light its not good  its actually pretty bad but not horrible for some reason well a rated it for what it is it is what it is
432,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.27,long time want of mine 2016 vintage unfortunately most of the cocoa vanilla and cinnamon has faded already all that remains is the apple brandy and strong ancho chilies spicy burn on finish im sure its a shell of its former self
433,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.17,bottle share thx to hopelessly0
434,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.46,review was for og not rerelease
435,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.75,this amazing beer combines tobacco peppers vanilla and what tastes like brandy into the quintessential barrel aged beer that pours perfectly and combines amazing mouthfeel carb and taste
436,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.15,2016 vintage  drank 022421  smell pleasant with notes of tobacco and chocolate  taste  the tobacco over powers this one in the beginning and then as it warms the peppers take over very unique taste and i think its the brandy barrel influence  feel  thin and i expected more  overall  for being the 4 overall beer on ba i expected more much more the feel was thin and notes of pepper overpowered this yet it was not completely unenjoyable just not even close to the 4th best beer in the world regardless glad i gut to try it as its always nice to see what the hype is about this one just didnt live up to it
437,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.23,2016 was worth it 2014 idk man
438,Porter,4.5,nice blend of coffee chocolate and smokiness perfect brunch beer nice and smooth
439,Porter,3.94,draught quite dark chestnut with a little dark orange for highlights moderate but fairly sharp dark roasted grain aroma pretty good level of dark roasted grain in a medium light bodied brew and it goes on to the finish
440,Porter,3.9,20211109 16oz can served in a tulip dated 092821 received from wunderllama as a retaliation been in nbs bif 14  pours dark with a big mediumdensity head light carbonation smell is moderate chocolate and coffee and a lot of nuts yeasty grainy maybe some anise  taste is similar though somewhat mild chocolate coffee and nuts anise somewhat muted mild to heavy roasty bitterness some light woodiness and some grainy sweetness  mouthfeel is medium to thick overall a very solid porter
441,Porter,4.83,ok so the beer i had was a coffee porter on nitro at the brewery but i could not find it on beer advocate this beer is so ridiculously fantastic smooth creamy not overly carbonated subtle notes of vanilla and chocolate idk its just great
442,Porter,4.24,wicked much more lively than a typical porter enough hops to cut into the syrupy malts which still dominate  as they should satisfyingly rich and dense with enough fizz to balance and cut that drinking one satisfies nicely  but not so heavy that more would be too rich  as can be the case for me with porters wicked
443,Porter,4.3,decanted into a 12 oz 355 ml clear goblet from a 16 oz 473 ml can canned on 070720 a pours a very dark clear brown color with a two finger tan head cap and ring retention and complex rings of lacing s aromas of molasses cocoa mocha toffee and macadamia nuts t semisweet flavors mirror the nose but much more birch beer andor sarsaparilla solid but balanced bitterness m light to medium bodied with moderate effervescence o mayflower has come up with a light but delicious angloamerican porter
444,Porter,4.1,appropriately dark appearance with a medium size tan head and a fair amount of lacing slightly ashy coffee chocolate and caramel malt aroma flavors of dark bread coffee and molasses sweetness evident throughout but more pronounced in the aftertaste medium bodied decently carbonated mouthfeel with an average length finish
445,Hoptimum,3.67,not the hop bomb i was expecting has a annoying maltysweetness to it that i dont care for i was hunting this down for a while and i was let down
446,Hoptimum,4.15,for anyone looking for the stronger styles this one fits the bill making stronger ale needs more hops to balance out the vast quantities of malt and they succeed making that name appropriate
447,Hoptimum,4.41,look  deep gold solid white head little lacing smell  dank ripe fruit piney citrus taste  sweet fruit piney hoppy resinous feel  medium body moderate carbonation highly resinous sticky finish overall  this is one hoppy mutha a tale of two halves to this gem shes a bit boozy at first and the juicy fruitiness is more present on the scent and taste its like a hoppy juicy candyesque treat as it breathes and warms it shifts to the piney hoppy resinous flavor with some citrus to balance it out if youre looking for your hop fix this is it let it warm sip and enjoy ratchet up blue oyster cult and zero in on godzilla for this monster
448,Hoptimum,3.35,2023 version  pretty average not impressed with this one a vaguely annoying sweetness is going on here and its just overall not that interesting of a brew  a perfectly drinkable beer nice and crisp but i cant find anything i really love about it not much complexity i can think of many other ipas id rather be drinking  somewhat heavy abv at 11 one bottle will have you feeling a buzz so dont have too many of these
449,Hoptimum,4.57,look poured into snifter burnt orange in color with a fluffy beigecolored head  smell strong notes of citrus fruits  orange in particular strong hoppy aromas as well very dank but also has a sweetness to it as well that makes for a really pleasant smell  taste powerful hoppy front nice bitterness that youd expect and it really bites down on you citrus fruits follow  im getting the orange from the nose plus lemon malts some barley and then theres a really nice bitterness after the baseline taste finishes all in all it has a very imperial taste to it and its superb  feel heavy on this one  its 11 abv and tastes  feels imperial the carbonation is medium but it sits heavy take your time with this one and sip it steadily  overall wonderful offering that id buy again
450,Hoptimum,4.3,ipa pushed to extreme end taste is massive tropical and floral
451,Hoptimum,3.79,12 ounce bottle dated 41323 poured fridge cold into a wasatch brewing canglass generous foam rises above an orange tinted bronze brew a little sticky lace manages its way throughout the drink aroma is disappointing its not as mighty as it should be for a huge tipa taste is a tad confusing its not this big hoppy dank bomb i was expecting  hoping for the sweetness is annoying theres a hint of bitterness trying to surface but the sweet kicks it back down mouth is nicely dense mid carbonation overall points for reaching sw florida at just 5 weeks since bottling but damn this should be so much more in every department  except the buzz a pair of these gets the cheeks red that may be its saving grace
452,Hoptimum,2.05,ehhh dont bother with this one
453,Hoptimum,4.02,12oz bottled 4622 opened 21223 1 finger white head with very good retention leaves behind some thin wisps of lacing early orangegold body with great clarity big nose of candied orange late mint and sweet malt sweet fruit  fruit salad with berries tropical and some ripe citrus full body creamy mouthfeel  no real heat but the 11 is apparent long finish with some lingering sweetness very good
454,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.33,this is a tame ipa but i like it well enough id be happy to drink it a party at which i didnt pay for it  haha thats not a bash its just a very inoffensive and not rebellious form of the style that has a more pronounced malt profile and a balanced and tame hope bite  sure if you are not an ipa drinker you may notice what might be perceived as a strong hop presence giving it the typical citrus and pine notes it does pour a golden color with a frothy head creating an inviting appearance so theres also thatput it in a glass and church it up baby  the standout features of this beer is its balance despite the high hop content it manages to maintain a smooth and drinkable flavor that i think makes it very middling in the true sense of the word but not necessarily in a bad way  the bitterness is wellmatched with a malty sweetness creating a harmonious flavor profile this beer is perfect for those who enjoy a strong and hoppy ipa without overpowering the senses  a brewery that made its name not making hoppy beers has made one that i think is aligned with their overall portfolio i can appreciate this as their ipa not the prototypical american or wc ipa this is a sam adams ipa and its good
455,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.82,this beer is way more balanced than your typical ipa the first note was more malt than hops which was interesting bread and toasted malt then the hops floral slightly earthy a bitnof pine balance is the big word here super drinkable a goto beer for sure
456,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,4,a lighter ipa that i think works well as a tasty refresher
457,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.63,poured a couple of brown 12 oz bottles into a singular clear glass liter mug for observation its a light bright copper color with emphasis on light rather translucent more than colorful maybe the head and lacing will compensate no theres little of either there the lacing outperforms but not by much its not aromatic neither ok now for the taste the big category unfortunately nothing to rave about here its pretty good well balanced between a noticeable malt backbone which is more earthy than sweet good and a hoppy finish the body is a little thin and the hops arent bitter enough but theyre there if ever there was an ipa intended to be mass produced to offend the least number of drinkers this is it not at all rebellious it conforms to the basic norms of a mainstream beer with a hint of a style above the standard american lager likely the best choice at national chain restaurants
458,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.87,121114 appearance clear bright golden hue longlasting bone white head looking good  aroma fresh and lively hop aromatics screaming with citrus and tropical fruits bristling with pine and grass green as it gets  taste brisk hop bite at the front soft and mellow from there on out light bodied but with a long bitter hop finish exquisite drinkability but for hopheads only bitter hop resins lay long on the palate providing more than sufficient refreshment for those of us who crave the alpha acids  a very nice rendition of this popular style but its not just not landing on the top tier im afraid a few steps short  wait i just noticed something the box reads enjoy before dec 2014 no specific date given this was purchased in early december 2014 i always see a lot of these cases at the store i bought it at im guessing its not that popular for whatever reason maybe if id bought it earlier it would taste fresher and id see higher up on that tiermaybe  whats the paper on the bottle say rebel ipa is brewed with 5 varieties of west coast hops cascade simcoe centennial chinook  amarillo its everything we love about west coaststyle ipas big citrus  grapefruit flavors with subtle pine notes for a flavorful refreshing brew
459,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.83,pours golden yellow with a 34 inch white head moderate lacing  aroma is grassy piney fruity cedar  tastes of pine grapefruit earth resinous  medium bodied light carbonation semidry finish  lower carbonation than i expect from an ipa bottled 1219 may be past its prime still a good beer
460,Game Day Light,1.41,the best way to describe game day light is to use simple words as this is a simple beer the flavor can be best described as musty the carbonation is overbearing and chafing to the mouth the aroma is of overly ripe fruit grapes or plums it has a strong head which burns out to reveal the aforementioned molten carbonation  however when purchased for a song at 399 usd for a twelve pack of cans or even at a slightly higher 599 usd it can be a pleasure to drink like water and a painful tincture to imbibe quickly i can personally attest that after nearly drinking a pallet of this beer it can liven up a party with a lack of beverages very quickly  if you have to have a beer which you can enjoy tastewise and you are tight on cash look elsewhere a malt liquor might simply be a better choice if you need a beer that will ensure some intoxication at a decent price this is probably a poor choice but it is an option which can be exercised
461,Game Day Light,2.09,pours a slightly hazy light yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down smell is of malt grain grass and nail polish remover aromas taste is much the same with watery malt and fruit flavors on the finish there is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip this beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel overall this is a poor beer that lives up to the light name with some watery and bland flavors
462,Game Day Light,2.65,poured very pale gold into a shaker pint glass three fingers of white head head becomes a ring toward the bottom a nice sheet of fine lacing on one side of the glass smells slightly grainy taste is sweet and very light a bit like that sparkling cider that nondrinkers buy for champagne substitute only very watered down no real hop presence detected mouthfeel was thin but ok on the carbonation overall a beer that was worth every penny of the 299 for the 12pack a great beer for the people that dislike hops or anything bitter cheaper than coke pepsi and most bottled water works out to 25 cents per beer wow
463,Game Day Light,1.98,note im giving this beer a fair chance i didnt even look at previous or average ratings  a very light yellow like a stained antique newspaper youd find in an old writing desk  s smells like champange sparkling white wine whatever you want to call it but it smells exactly like a brut  t very light and lacking any sort of depth sort of tastes like watered down grape juice i dont know where the beer is in this honestly tastes just roll off the tounge too quickly im going to say it tastes a little like lemon sprite white grapes and poland spring water tastes a little bit like perfume too in a bad way  m legitimately not even there in all fairness im sure they were going for the taste of perfumed water but its just not acceptable  o im sure my biases kicked in and told me to reject the light macro beer before me but i really did give it a chance im probably not going to finish the can esspecially knowing i have other beers in the fridge i could only drink this if i were dying of thirst simple
464,Game Day Light,1.89,from 24 fl oz can no 07502004 sampled on june 6 2011 the pour is straw pale yellow with a lot of fizzy white head at first that bubbles down quickly like a soft drink the aroma is made up of adjuncts like corn and rice and virtually no malts or hops to speak of the body is very thin like water the taste is quite intolerable with a flat adjunctladen chemicaltype character although there are some hops on the tail endjust barely this one is weaker than its regular beer sibling
465,Game Day Light,1.82,the canquest tm has morphed into an allcansuming focus for me in which i will simply drink any beer that comes in a can i have reviewed some oddities before but beer from 711 ah the memories of the mid1970s when we did not have a nearby 711 and had to wait for the annual jersey shore trip to load up on their marvel comics slushee cups  how my rents ever put up with sucking those things down remains beyond my ken we had a 711 in lancaster at james and water sts for a short while but those days are long gone sos my pops in a random memory of the late70s on labor day weekend taking my brother and i for the ice cream cookies that were sandwiched between oatmeal cookies and covered in chocolate after watching several hours of the jerry lewis mda telethon  crack  glug time my aggressive pour netted me two fingers of foamy bonewhite head that lasted about as long as the foam at high tide at the shore long beach island in case you wondered the haven beach motel in beach haven run by mr flynn of flynn real estate llc now where was i oh my but the nose had the grapiness of the g d ice ouch and ooof that along with a metallic tang gets it an epic fail zounds the color was a pale lemonyellow with nequality clarity mouthfeel was thin and the taste was present but unobtrusive it was just bland as all getout it had a light bitterness but noting beyond that booooring not bad but more towards why bother 110 calories im switching back to corona light my buff figure cant handle this
466,Game Day Light,1.48,711 special pours a very pale clear yellow with a huge airy white head head fell relatively slow to just about nothing no real lace  has a clean cereal and medical aroma not very inviting  taste is thin and again medical with a pronounced sweetness watery  very thin and watery mouthfeel with a slight tingle on the tongue  not good at all taste is really weak and really strange mass produced with cheap ingredients avoid
467,Game Day Light,2.01,the appearance is pale gold with a medium head that fades to nothing the aroma is almost non existent hints of sweet malt and corn with a touch of chemicals the taste is like the aroma but not disgusting the palate is thin overall this is pretty much what i expected
468,Game Day Light,2.11,served in a cocacola flared pint glass  while visiting a nearby 711 i found myself facetoface with this oddity i was compelled to purchase and give it a go it pours a ridiculously clear very pale straw topped by a quicklydisappearing finger of white fizz giving the surface a deep sniff this beer has the same problem my boy phil fry once suffered from it has no nose i wanna say theres some watereddown corn syrup but that could just be the air in my apartment i think my air conditioner has issues but yeah i smell nothing here as though water were sitting in the glass hm a taste yields some of that suspected corn syrup swimming in what seems like an ocean along with a hint of rice and a slight tinniness im assuming from the can there isnt much here to be objectionable but thats mainly cause there aint much here to begin with the body is infused with helium with barely any carbonation and a very watery feel like ive said before it mostly seems like water i have a sneaking suspicion 711s screwing with me by selling me a can of flavored water instead of an actual beer oh well at least it goes down quick and easy boo this beer
469,Game Day Light,1.27,24 oz man can for 99 cents at a gas station in joliet  a  yellow and fizzy  s  corny and grainy smells a bit off like slightly stale cereal or wet grains  t  whew not good corn sour old socks and tart old nasty lemonade  m  light overcarbonated  d  not as bad as game day ice but still not even close to decent
470,Game Day Light,2.52,a  poured a clear straw color with a white head that fades after a minute of two to nothing  s  has a very corny and sweet malt nose  t  for what it is its really not all that bad below average yes but its a cheap light lager sweet corny malt without much to it  m  this beer has a light body with medium high carbonation to it  d  while this isnt the first id buy to take to the pool or a bbq for what it is its not horrible if i ever get laid off again and become poor again i could see this being a regular in the fridge
471,Game Day Light,1.2,i picked this up in 24oz cans from 711  appearance very pale yellow color with a huge white head which stayed around longer than its ice counterpart  smell corn and malty sweetness at least no cat pee  taste there really is no taste to it im really trying here to detect something but i got nothing  mouthfeel very high carbonation but very thin and watery body  overall i tried thats really all i can say this beer has no value to add to the current beer market not even those who drink the big boys bmc stuff will appreciate this one because there is nothing to appreciate about this beer i predict that this beer wont last very long
472,Big Bad Baptist,4.24,pours jet black with low tan head  smell is roasted with notes of coffee coffee grounds dark chocolate and tobacco  taste is roasted and a bit sweet with notes of coffee chocolate bourbon and vanilla some hints of cured meat and a bit of bitterness  mouthfeel is medium soft and well carbonated  overall a very nice pretty laid back impy
473,Big Bad Baptist,4.38,pored great it went exceptionally well with a cigarette very thick and strong bodied but not in a bad way my only complaint is that the head takes forever to dissipate regardless of how you pour  for taste i have to give it a 910 honestly one of the best bottle of beers i have ever had
474,Big Bad Baptist,4.49,pours a dark brown black with a little tan head the aroma kills chocolate coffee bourbon with the taste those same qualities with a strong presence from the barrel its like fbs on steroids delicious and oh so easy to drink at this high abv epic has a winner with this one and will definitely keep an eye peeled for this in the future
475,Big Bad Baptist,4.63,look poured from a 12oz can into a sniffer  jet black pour with about a fingers length of foam risen to the surface a bit of lacing is left behind as it dissolves back into liquid form pours quite thin for a 118 smell getting big notes of chocolate  rich baking chocolate getting some caramel and toffee as well as some molasses too not to much on the coffee notes here or bourbonwhiskey either taste first you get a coffee aromic taste followed by the chocolatey that backs it up the thing that stands out the most is definitely the chocolate im getting hints of oakyness and vanilla as well its rich yet not to heavy in a sense that you can drink it easily the alcohol is very well hidden and thats surprising being a 118 beer i didnt get much of a whiskey taste in this and this might be due to ageing it for months in a barrel vs some places do years even though the whiskey bourbon barrels arent to present but its a very good sipper feel this is so smooth that you cant even tell its a heavy beer its not chewy or oily at all very light carbonation  might throw a lot of people off by this alone yet so smooth easy sipper for sure overall i was hesitant paying the price for a four pack but man im glad i got to experience this ill definitely be buying again and even aging some to see how it turns out
476,Big Bad Baptist,4,smell is huuuge spicy bourbon notes chocolate marshmallow and a hint of coffee taste is plenty of bourbon coffee and dark chocolate with oaky hints i think the feel is what throws me off very nice heat behind it but not as thick or as carbonated as expected overall i think the feel distracts from the taste a bit which is too bad because the balance of coffee and bourbon is phenomenal
477,Big Bad Baptist,4.46,pours out a black color with a beige head smell is of whiskey coffee dark chocolate and malt the taste is of whiskey coffee cocoa dark chocolate malt oak and vanilla very good and i had this one for breakfast along with my usual straight black cup of coffee great ill be drinking more of this type for sure
478,Big Bad Baptist,4.62,12 ounce can into an epic snifter poured at 50 deep night black with a generous finger of dense foam smell on the spin is coffee up front malt sweetness right behind taste is roasty malt fresh pulled espresso rich dark cacao sweet tobacco the bourbon barrel is subtle but present coffee is the star of this show feel is smooth decadently rich light to medium carbonation overall beautifully smooth coffee stout sipper very wellexecuted and balanced one of anericas best
479,Big Bad Baptist,4.43,pours black gloriously dark with a wondrous two finger head of nicely bubbled foam aroma is strongly coffee and dark chocolate i could smell this brew all day taste is not as carbonated as i thought a light chocolate than anticipated and the coffee is likewise present but subdued none of this is truly as bad as it sounds but is noticeable this is very pleasant and for this abv very drinkable an easy to like imperial stout
480,Big Bad Baptist,3.8,rel 101 pours a dark dark brown with a faint hint of red fully opaque in the glass with a think khaki colored head that quickly receded to a longlasting cap aroma is really nice rich chocolate dominates while the coffee and whiskey barrels have faded  taste is almost the opposite of the nose no direct coffee notes but plenty of roast and some really nice barrel flavors theres not much in the way of sweetness but thats not at all a bad thing this beer is several years old and while i cant attest to what it tastes like fresh it has a certain balanced mellowness to it that im really enjoying full bodied and smooth going down
481,Big Bad Baptist,3,might have gotten one of the bad batches2020 is all i remember had a weird sour note i couldnt shake got a little better as it warmed but not much definitely wont be buying again disappointing
482,Dutch Gold Imported,1.25,in ireland for 12 days and nights handful of euro notes to spend before next days departure just enough to buy 3 of these that cost 1 euro apiece this pours a crystal clear uninviting pale gold it does pour a head of foam it is the fastest disappearing head of foam i have ever seen no side glass lace period looks like a sample you drop off at the lab for your own personal lab values aroma a very little bit of grass taste is this really beer the only reason why this beer gets more than the bare minimum 100 is that there was nothing offensive in the odor
483,Dutch Gold Imported,1.67,appearance poured from can into nonreal pint glass in low altitude galway ireland on september 18th 2010 pours a clear yellow with an abominable thin head that quickly reduces to nothing a pathetic appearance that looks a bit like urine  cant wait  smell a nasty aroma of stale hops and overcarbonation this isnt looking good  taste barely one note of light hops bleeding into a sharp finish theres very little to say about this beers taste its a bit like water with a beer flavour in fact the main note is water this beer is bland uninspired unambitious and poorly built even for the price  mouthfeel wet and fizzy throughout unrefreshing neither smooth nor coarse but discernably awful  drinkability at least its a bit better than most american macro lagers at this price range if youre just looking to get intoxicated youre better off going with steel reserve this beer might taste better on the way up if i werent a broke student i wouldnt be having another
484,Dutch Gold Imported,2.49,i am not sure but think this beer can be bought only in ireland where is quite popular in discount stores  pours golden with arge head that slowly fades scarce patchy lacing aroma is very light malty taste is light lemony hops with some sweetish malt nothing complex light mouthfeel with medium carbonation  overall it is below average supermarket lager
485,Cisk XS Extra Lager,2.2,performed blind tasting  appearance light golden straw color with a very thing white head smell  smells sweet with hints of corn and alcohol aroma taste  sweet pale malts corn and alcohol  tastes like an american malt liquor mouthfeel  too thin and pale to mask the high alcohol  overall  might as well drink a steel reserve
486,Cisk XS Extra Lager,3.2,poured from a brown 112 oz bottle has a rich golden color with a 12 inch head smells of fruits some alcohol taste is dominated by alcohol a bit of grains and malts feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability overall this is a decent brew but nothing special
487,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.87,i found this single 33oml brown bottle at the binnys store in plainfield il for 199 so this is not a cheap beer as that price comes out to 12 a 6 pack the freshness date on the back label says may 9th of 2o1o and this is already july of 2o1o so i realize i am reviewing an out of date bottle  the beer poured a hazy yellowishorange color and made a 1 finger fizzy white head that disappeared in under 3o seconds there was very little lacing present  sweet grainy smell mixed with alcohol and call me crazy but im also getting a trace of fruit  perhaps orange  this beer has an odd taste very sweet malt and grains steeped in alcohol i cant get the alcohol off my tongue i dont know if there are citrus hops in here but there is some underlying orange flavoring to this as well but overall it is not a tasty beer its an alcoholic mess  theres enough sugary sweetness in here to make it medium to full bodied but even the relatively high carbonation cannot cut through the heavy amount of alcohol alcohol coats the tongue and leaves a nasty sweet alcoholic aftertaste  not a very drinkable beer but it will at least give you a buzz with just one
488,Cisk XS Extra Lager,3.07,this is an interesting brew from malta a small island off of italy that used to be controlled by the british this is there version of a strong lager and this is a good example how the euro strong lager and british influence combine to make a interesting brew  this is a pale yellow and crystal body the smell is sweet with a nice hop bitterness  the taste is crisp almost like a good euro lager with more abv  not the best beer ever but decent i really dont know why it got so many bad reviews this is a pretty good beer much better than a d or f
489,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.44,a brew from the fine mediterranean island country of malta eh 12 oz bottle with a best before stamp of feb 10 pours a clear medium gold color with a pretty nice cap of white foam that lasts pretty long for a euro lager leaves some decent lacing as well  smell is nosewrinklingly bad smells like a homeless skunk living under the overpass that just drank a fifth of cheap vodka and shat all over himself okay maybe not quite that bad but i do ask myself dare i take a sip smells so damn boozy with cornsyrup cloying sweetness  whewthose poor poor maltanian bastards this stuff is wicked bad imagine a 40 oz of malt liquor boiled down to about 12 oz becoming the consistency of thin syrup and adding 3 ounces of grain alcoholthat is pretty much what this tastes like sweetness is ridiculously cloying and the beer is viscous as hell feeling in the mouth avoid at all costs unless you are a glutton for punishment am i going to finish this bitch maybe but only because i had to buy two of these mfers cause the first one exploded in my freezer
490,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.69,pours out a nice yellowyorange color with a bit of head deceiving me into thinking this could be a good find  however upon smelling all i get is a grainy alcohol smell with perhaps a bit of sweetness i think this beer is 9 abv so i guess i can accept that but have a feeling this could be a bad omen  the taste is really not enjoyable ive had plenty of stronger beers but none of them tasted like alcohol as much as this really overpowers any of the light sweetness in the flavor  again the alcohol dominance didnt really help the mouthfeel  i would not drink another one unless someone paid me to im not really familiar with the euro strong lager style so im not sure if its an acquired taste but i dont think ill be acquiring it any time soon
491,Cisk XS Extra Lager,2.14,bright goldenrod almost orange with a few tiny flakes being buffeted about by a few tiny bubble streams either the beer isnt filtered or the filter didnt have very small pores the cream colored crown looks pretty good its richly creamy and is doing a bangup job with lace especially considering the abv and the probable lack of hops  the nose is similar to the nose on every other euro strong lager on the face of the earth it features vodkasoaked grain with a side order of noble hops a very small side order maybe its the american in me but malt liquor smells and tastes better than most esls  ive had worse less jet fuel flavor and more uh anything else would have been an improvement this is far from refined beer but then i knew that going in it has an odd sort of charm if you like highoctane lagers that numb the tongue i cant imagine that applies to many beer drinkers who dont live on skid row  if youve had any of the euro strong lagers from eastern europe then you already know what cisk extra lager tastes like think pale malt and grass steeped in grain alcohol then cut with mineral water moderate sweetness and moderate bitterness keep things moderately uninteresting to the end  the mouthfeel isnt horrible if you like them on the full and quiet side a lingering slickness is kept from being stickiness by the solvent quality of the ethanol no one drinks this stuff for the mouthfeel anyway they drink it for the brainfeel  cisk xs is my second maltese beer and is my second lousy maltese beer on the positive side after two or three bottles the rest should go down pretty easily if you decide to take the plunge and buy a bottle not recommended dont forget the brown paper bag
492,Cisk XS Extra Lager,3.78,nose is grainy with very soft noble hops smells okay  pours a medium yellow good clarity mild creamy head with lasting retention looks pretty goods  creamy malty sweet tart and a little bitter soft sweet malt makes a great flavor for the smooth creamy body that lends itself to nice carbonation grainy and toasty with biscuit and nut tones warm and inviting somewhat tartsour noble hops add a little grounding and then almost disappear theres a little hop flavor  clean flowery and earthyherbal finishes fairly clean slight nutty malt just slight tastes good feels very good good drinkability  i dont know what beer the rest of yall reviewed but this is quite pleasant
493,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.95,pours into a pint glass with a hazy deep yellow color thin white head disapates quickly leaving more scum than lace behind  aroma is sweet and grainy like canned corn  flavor is also on the sweet side like many a macro its mostly corn or rice from what i can tell it has an awful grain alcohol heat to it almost like a shot of cheap vodka was added  mouthfeel is pretty bad too with medium body alcohol burn and too much carbonation drinkability is poor i wouldnt be looking for another even if it was free
494,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.59,poured into an american pint glass this beer is a very pale quite clear strawgold color with a substantial 2finger head on top the nose is quite grainy with a little hint of solvent ugh an extremely sweet nearly cloyingly sweet beer with no hint of anything hoppy together with medicinal very harsh alcohol thinbodied and watery and nearly undrinkable i couldnt finish a single glassill have to find someone to give this away to
495,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.98,appearance its very clear and a lighter gold color it has a foamy white head that maybe reaches a finger deep it receded pretty quickly and left an average lacing behind very average  smell its very sweet smelling up front theres some earthygrainy notes smells a tad vegetal im definitely picking up a slight big of corn alcohol comes through very strong at 9 i expected that to some degree but its more prevalent than it should be  taste mother of god someone needs to head down to malta and teach those doods how to brew some beer wow this is one sweet and sugary brew theres some light fruity notes pear and apple mostly light carameltoffee flavors add more sweetness it is grainy and earthy theres a light vegetal cornlike flavor alcohol is very prevalent and downright hot its offensive finishes very hot  mouthfeedrinkability its close to being thick carbonation feels pretty light its not smooth but its not bad this is probably its strength if you want to call it that drinkability is poor the flavor is not good and its way too hot theres nothing to really enjoy here  i picked up this beer a few days ago out of curiosity i was told it was bad its actually worse than i expected i cant pick out a flaw here or there to pick on it needs so much work all across the board i wouldnt recommend it well maybe if youre looking for a beer from malta but theres got to be a better one than this right
496,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.91,a much like the original lager poured a crystal clear goldenorange with a frothy paper white head that was 2 fingers high and displayed a very good retention rate visible carbonation was light while the lacing left a thin film sheeting behind  s the nose yielded fresh corn on the cob fresh grains with some dried hay and sweet corn fructose overall found this to be rather uneventful when compared to their cisk lager which was more aromatic and hoppier this was average at best with some corn liquor detection  t the flavor was overly sweet with some sweet corn green corn stalks and a medicinal taste that was hard to describe reminded me of walking down a sterile hospital hall some sour bittering with fermented fruit which tasted more like some prison hooch overall no real flavor just corn meal and alcohol  m slick very oily and was light bodied leaving a sour corny finish  d drinkability was not good as to be expected didnt really care to finish this one and was a struggle to justify why a huge disappointment when compared to its original lager which was more hoppy grainy and flavorful this one came off as cheap cornmalt liquor and comes with a non recommend and a cheers to their original lager
497,Cisk XS Extra Lager,2.24,a  pours crystal clear and light gold head is pure white and tops out at around half inch retention is average a fairly healthy amount of lace clings to the sides of the glass not a bad looking brew looks refreshing overall  s  sweeter malt aromas are first to radiate from this one some honey here some pale malt there not cloying but i can already tell this beer could be very sweet alot of graininess pushes through about midway hot alcohol finishes things off  t  sweet and hot pale malt honey sugar and more pale malt kind of get shoved on to the palate by a burning alcohol flavor just a hint of apple combines with the sweetness but that is just not even close to enough to bring balance big grainy flavors are present but still cant balance the flavor too well  m  on the fuller side of medium bodied with light carbonation that seems to work well with the brew finish is hot and sweet while staying clean  d  drinkability is really not looking good for this brew too sweet and too hot it would be best to just start all over with this brew take it back to the drawing board and start tweaking until something a little better wass produced not recommended at all
498,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.88,i was absolutely not impressed im not sure if the beer i drank was skunk or if it tastes like that when it is fresh i like many others i am sure thought it would be at least a decent buy because of brewery location but i was so wrong waste of my money and time i would almost rather be drinking a macrobrew  appearance was flat with very little lace to the glass there wasnt much of a smell but if i had to describe it i would say rubbing alcohol not a smooth tasting brew at all mouth feel was about average with a good amount of carbonation
499,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.06,this is by far the worst beer i have ever tasted to be honest i couldnt give you an accurate review because the beer upset my gag reflex and i could not get past the second sip all i remember was pure torment  the smell was putrid and grainy and it had a rough alcohol taste  i wish i could give it a zero in all categories except appearance because it was truly the most offensive liquid i have ever drank
500,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.03,glass pokal glass temp chilled to approx 40 degrees  very light yellow colored liquid like honey water not in a good way only slightly more yellow color than your average bmc product good twofinger white foamy head that leaves a thin film on top with no lacing not very appealing looking actually  sweet sugarey bandaids mixed with artificial fruit flavoring dominate the nose smells similar to redbull really very slight malt scent is detected  oh my god its foul imagine if you gave someone a tumbler of tequila and redbull why on ice then put out two or three cigarettes in it and let it sit on the counter until the next morning upon waking your hungover self blindly grabs that glass and takes a drink this beer tastes like that  thick and putrid honestly its that bad  stay away dont do it save yourself i picked this beer up because of its origin geographically which is malta never heard anything about their beer making skills now i know why avoid at all costs
501,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.75,rating skewed because this is pizza to wash down beer and potato chips not to savor and analyze also skews high because many of its small set of na peers cheap domestic not craft have weird aftertastes andor just dont taste like beer it hits the spot when its called for
502,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,3.99,when you have to go to that place this na is very comforting the lack of flatness is what grabbed me did some researching and learned the big houses basicly boiled there alcohol out and recarbonated the beer old mil spins theirs in a centrifuge to a thin layer and flash heats it no need to recarbonate it and the flavor i always liked does not suffer i just cant find it when i need too anymore becks na comes next
503,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.79,have to have 1 or 2 nites per week no alcohol so i have these fake beers often german american canadian doesnt matter all taste like crap but this one doesnt have the tell tale after taste i am used to nice carbonation and not a malt bomb so is drinkable
504,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,4.71,i loved it for a non alcoholic beer it tasted just like a real beer no malt or bad aftertaste at all i absolutely love it and will start drinking this all the time
505,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.75,tried 3 ways standard pour into a standard pint glass followed by same poured into sam adams ipa glass trying to capture more aroma though the former is obviously the most common serving method and also from the can  pours a crystal clear yellow gold color with moderate large bubble carbonation initial frothy head reduces quickly to poor lacing and little rim retention adhesion on the glass is poor  smells of wet grass hay corn corn syrup and that paste you ate back in kindergarten although you wont admit it very poor though in carrying with the malt liquor and adjunct lager corn based beer category  all three palette notes are the same lots of paste envelope glue candy corn corn syrup stale uncooked rice and a bit of wet hay very poor if only average at best again considering the category  syrup like mouthfeel with not so clean finish lingering corn paste and a bit of skunk cabbage that i honestly wish was more at least it would be less bland and less like i just revisited my love of paste during art classnonsavory snack time  poor if not below average at best overall not recommended so many other good nas out there maybe if you want to drink a piece of history as well as feel like you are but beyond that checkbox move along young manlady to something better the original version is not much better in fact it might be worse so yeah move along after checking the box oh so regrettably
506,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,4.5,the color and feel of a straw colored seroma pleasantly metallic tasting notes with a clean wispy finish its a sentimental favoritethe groomsmen and i will always have carmel and old milwaukee
507,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.69,rating it for what it is a nonalcoholic that is fake beer if i want something in the garage fridge to help convince my wife why i smell strongly of beer this is a good bet
508,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,3.85,comparing only na beers bud light and miller lite not my favorite sierra nevada pale ale bonly available in cans in my areab this poured with a very light straw yellow color it produced a three finger head and still had a full head an hour later the aroma was definitely that of a decent beer the taste was that of a very light but fairly full bodied light beer with no burnt or overtly sweet aftertastes i was not expecting much because old milwaukee has been in and out of production but for a non alcoholic beer this is one american na beer i would serve to my guests along with clausthaler and becks the best of the bunch
509,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,1,if you absolutely crave one of the worst beers in the world without the silver lining of at least catching a buzz it doesnt get any better than this falls flat on its ass in every single category id rather drink a barqs root beer than this at least barqs doesnt make your stomach turn with every gulp
510,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.42,a pours a crystal clear medium straw yellow in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and some faint golden yellow highlights the beer has a three finger tall sudsy bright white head that reduces to a large patch of medium thick film surrounded by a very thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass significant amounts of lacing are observed  s moderate aromas of corn adjuncts over lighter aromas of grainy malts  t upfront there are light flavors of grainy malts with light to moderate flavors of corn adjuncts slightly vegetal minimal amounts of sweetness or hop presence overall the beer has a very light flavor more reminiscent of mineral water than a beer  m light bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation slightly thinwatery  o very drinkable and definitely lacks the chemicallike flavor that you get in a lot of the american na lagers very light flavor and aroma
511,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.25,apours a straw color with a slight head and lacing aaroma has slight malt hints tthe taste follows the nose with a slight malt flavor ma light bodied well carbonated beer oa decent beer
512,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,1.97,i wonder why na beer cant have more flavor and mouth feel cant you boil up an ipa and just bottle it sterile
513,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.48,tastes like a typical malt liquor the head disappears very quickly little carbonation not an especially terrible beer but nothing special either average the 8 alcvol kicks in like most similar types of extra strong beer will take a pass on this one from now on
514,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.54,red horse extra strong is crystal clear and pale amber in color thin streams of carbonation support a cloudy bone white head with fairly average retention taking a sniff the first thing i smell is generic almost sugary sweetness soda cracker comes in second lending support to the up front aromas of sugar aromas of malt and sugar lead into a center where i smell corn adjuncts and the lagery whiff of sulfur mix in the alcoholic burn of this beers 8 abv and the aroma takes on a vaguely white wine quality the finish is full of the leafy fresh cut grass smell of european hops on the tongue flavors of corn adjunct and alcoholic spiciness dominate up front those flavors lead right into flavors of sulfur those flavors combine in a way that isnt very flattering or enticing flavors of soda cracker or baked bread are nonexistent sugary sweetness provides an interesting through note adding just enough to the proceedings to give an unflattering illusion of white wine bitter is crisp and bitter its just not that good a beer its almost as though the brewery took every thing people hate about lager and distilled them together into one product red horse extra strongs only real redeeming feature is that its inexpensive and its strong beyond id give this beer a hard pass
515,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.13,bought this at the local filipino market in a pint can four pack pours a large foamy head but then dissipates quickly  clear golden color aroma is very bready and malty not much else to speak of taste is surprisingly light given the high abv i would compare this to steel reserve  but the taste is lighter and a bit more bitter yet sweet at the same time not a bad beer and worth a try if youre curious
516,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.62,a  pours a clear crystal lager colour with a white head that reduces quickly  s  nothing of note except some small malt  t  again nothing of note that is different to any other mass produced lager  m  light body with medium carbonation  o  not worth the effort this beer is just an ordinary lager with very little to warrant the extra layout
517,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.71,recently introduced to tjs at least here in san diego red horse is a smooth malt liquor clocking in at a stout 80 abv similar to steel reserve in strength its a bit smoother and possibly akin to carlsberg elephant good value at 449 for a fourback of 169 oz talls all served up in a cool can with horseshoe and chess knight motif to the reviewer who complained about the venerable trader carrying it dont like it dont buy it wuss
518,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.18,extra strong crisp clean easy smooth to drink with little head that goes away and some carbanion to it overall a not bad beer when best served cold at 8
519,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,4.48,funny how i am reading many of the ratings for red horse the first time i tried this beer i knew i finally found something that i would truly enjoy this is truly a situation of to each his own i fell in love with red horse the flavour for me is outstanding i love the higher alcohol content as well as the fact that it is not filling at least not to me loved it the first time i tried it not really a fan of lighter beers either for me this beer is a keeper and i just recently tried hurricane and it is very similar found another one that is a keeper for me enjoy and drink responsibly
520,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,1,this is easily the worst beer ive had in my entire life reeks of a high gravity like hurricanesteel reserve but this turned my stomach bought this at a trader joes what the hell are they doing carrying something like this  lol this beer made my sick im totally serious
521,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.23,sunday may 15 2011 200 pm bottle poured to pint glass very cold beer sight light pale yellow head a lot of lacing aroma not a lot scent smell of malt nothing else taste watery not a lot of taste mouth feel very carbonated overall good beer for the hot weather in the philippines and not to get drunk since it is soda the most inexpensive way
522,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.75,finally an american malt liquor i know its nothing to praise but still as many legends grew around this type of beer i just had to drink it looks a bit darker and intense than a pale lager but somehow you can tell that its perhaps the coloring the smell is also not that powerful and the taste also lacks the impression that makes a great beer  but it feels good to drink as cheap as it is as poor as it is it is easy to drink and it is enjoyable that being said i became even more interested in these malt liquors looking forward to drinking mickeys fine malt liquor and that ol english 800
523,Miller 64,1.89,pours out of the can a crystal clear yellow with a fizzy head that dissipates quickly smells like straw and sweet corn taste follows the nose not too much going on here pretty watery
524,Miller 64,2.44,poured from the can into a standard pint  a light fizzy and effervescent as expected pale straw color solid tight white head  s faint grain typical cheap pukey hop smell from aall type aluminum can notes remain  t shockingly not as bad as nose watery and grainy as expected i do not hate this ice cold on a hot day like today was  m carbonation makes it so light that you hardly notice the underlying chalkiness but it is there i assure you odd dryness with that bitter pill taste at ultimate finish when it warms updid i mention to keep it really cold  o you might call this walrus piss it is not intended to impress fancy beer palates it is for long session days when you do not want to get arrested in a blackout drunken rage at the most redneck campground you know where you overhear comments like the jailbird neighbors threatening physical violence to their tattooed floozey for not getting them another beer fast enough it saves you from that embarassment
525,Miller 64,2.06,12oz bottle stolen from my uncles fridge  this is so light its barely beer very light scent and taste badly burned corn and maybe an ethereal kiss of hops like you can tell theyre there but youre not actually smelling or tasting them this is a bust but on a lowcarb diet there arent many options  bad even considering what it is
526,Miller 64,5,great beer to watch calories and carbs this is the best tasting beer yet i wouldwill drink even when not watching weight love the taste it loses nothing in flavor very crisp
527,Miller 64,1.75,7112021 910pm est fort myers beach fl  poured into a pint glass  look straw yellow srm 1 with a bright white and sparkling ocean foam head lacing and head retention are pleasant  smell a faint hint of isolated oat and apple  taste a shadow of traditional miller the nuttylike characteristic is present but very diluted  feel very light and watery with a delicate fiz  overall one could think about drinking a beer and it would be more like drinking a beer than drinking this beer when the calories were cut so were the taste and abv this is the opposite of a too high and intrusive abv beer

548,Double Stack,4.4,canned 3623 sticky stacks stamped on the side of the can  its finally time to try this classic from great notion thanks to tavour its their most reviewed beer on ba and their only one to have entered the top 250 this should be their magnum opus will it be lets crack it open and find out  pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  this is absolutely a maple bomb in the nose but the coffee plays a nice supporting role as well im picking up on aromas of maple syrup milk chocolate burnt caramel medium roast coffee vanilla brown sugar and straight up pancakes  its surprisingly much more bitter in taste compared to the nose not to say that its super bitter but it has a nice bite on the front end of the sip im tasting raw maple dark roast coffee charred malt vanilla cocoa powder molasses light raisin and brown sugar the swallow brings notes of maple syrup dark roast coffee cacao nibs burnt caramel charred malt dark toast and light molasses  a medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a sweet beer with a bite finishes a tad sticky but nothing that hurts the drinkability  its not reinventing the wheel of maple adjuncted stouts but its damn good nonetheless
549,Double Stack,4.7,very dark brown color aroma is very maple forward with a lot of vanilla pastry and coffee notes flavor is amazing so sweet and so much going on again with the coffee vanilla and maple also toffee and caramel notes low bitterness very full body with some astringency holy crap would get again its so good taking lactase enzyme preemptively with this one because i am concerned
550,Double Stack,4.77,on tap at the brass tap cedar falls ia served in a 5ounce snifter pitch black in color with a thin tan head absolutely huge aromas and flavors of maple syrup dark roast coffee pancakes and char lots of roasty malt bitterness without much attendant sweetness slightly boozy with a syrupy mouthfeel notes of bitterness and char linger on the palate long after the finish overall well crafted and highly recommended
551,Double Stack,4.71,aroma gives off a strong alluring waft of maple and chocolatey malt taking a drink feels like getting a huge bite out of a big fluffy delicious belgian waffle coated in maple syrup followed by a roasty bite of coffee nothing ive ever had comes so close to the maple taste every sip is a breakfast meal in one top tier
552,Double Stack,4.19,can poured into a mountain rambler brewery snifter  a pours basically black with a frothy tan brown head that settles to a thin layer and leaves some thin lacing  s opening the can is like opening the door to a sugar shack as youre met with a wave of maple followed by bold coffee roasty malt a little char and faint smoke light earthy notes chocolate vanilla toffee and slightly toasty biscuity bready pancakeyness  t opens with a huge hit of maple syrup followed by milk chocolate vanilla and a nice touch of coffee that leads into roasty malt a little char and a touch of smoke with underlying mild earthy and slightly nutty notes toffee and toasty biscuitybready malt very reminiscent indeed of a stack of pancakes  m full body somewhat mild carbonation pretty smooth though somehow i would describe it as especially creamy alcohol is rather well hidden giving just the slightest touch of warmth as it comes up to room temp  o ive had a couple cans of this sitting in the fridge for a few years now just waiting for the right night to crack into my special liquid souvenirs from a great road trip but as time passed and that night never came i got on the lookout for a fresh can to purposely do the opposite with to push to the front of the line as quickly as possible and try fresh a lucky shipment of cans hit my area recently so here we are cracking into a can thats a little more than a month old  this beer probably has the strongest maple presence of any beer ive ever had including cbs to their credit you definitely get the sensation of taking a big bite of pancakes dripping with syrup after just taking a sip of your morning mocha unfortunately that kinda leads into its downfall while it is true to their own description of having an extreme maple syrup flavor it can come off as ungodly sweet up front not gonna lie im also a little weary of the label saying coffee maple syrup natural flavor and caramel color potentially meaning theres some kinda maple or pancake extract in there this one is fun to try but could really benefit from some balance upping the coffee backing the maple down a notch maybe even both would help make it less of a novelty and more of an enjoyable sipper you go back to maybe some age will do the trick ill definitely update when that right night comes along and i get into my vintage cans for now id say its a cool one to try as a short pour but it can get overwhelming in greater volumes
553,Coors Extra Gold,3.62,i researched and cant get a straight answer on if this beer is still brewed by molson coors this is a beer that you could drink one or twelve smooth and consistent in taste i hope to see on the ohio shelves in the future
554,Coors Extra Gold,4.36,underrated such a great tasting beer sorry it had little to no success in my region i live in a college town that has mega package stores but no extra gold american big brews are so underrated when they try an extra gold or dopple bock they get axed by the rednecks and hipsters
555,Coors Extra Gold,2.52,12 oz gold can  a pours a bright golden color one finger of bubbly white head strong carbonation no head retention or lacing color is nice though  s cool to the nose malts and grains sweet smelling cereal and corn  tm grainy and sweet dry malts a little creamy moderate carbonation crisp clean dry finish slight hop taste grassy and faintly floral bready malts  o pretty boring beer light on taste with a halfway decent mouthfeel could be crisper for me ive had worse from this style  cheers
556,Coors Extra Gold,3.92,honestly some of the best beer you can get for 650 a 12 pack in my opinion tastes better than budweiser has the same abv and is much much cheaper now im not a huge fan of budweiser myself but i know people are huge on it and to those people id say buy this and save a few bucks
557,Coors Extra Gold,2.27,rates about halfway between poor and below average pours a clear light gold color with decent head that fades quickly aroma is sweet and grainy taste follows the scent just something slightly off that i cant describe a bit more than light mouthfeel and an aftertaste that is best scribed as tinny
558,Coors Extra Gold,5,best beer ever and cheap
559,Coors Extra Gold,5,when i first drank it it had a bit to it and after the first one i noticed it was going down rather smooth and had a very enjoyable taste i have now been drinking is for 5 years and you cant beat the price
560,Coors Extra Gold,4.94,extra gold lager is a rich fullflavored lager with a deep golden color starts with slow aged roasted near toasty and you can taste it malts which are then combined with its other ingredients only water barley malt a germinated corn grind for a little extra maltose coors own nearly bottom possible temp yeast cascade hops certainly but i cant get an answer on their strain likely typical lager finishing hops because this beer is all lager if it was in a clear miller high life bottle with a redesign it would go from lawnmower beer to the top of the domestic lager game its a robust beautiful full crisp clean and perfect example of an american lager slowbrewed to produce this truly refined lager in an unassuming packaging at an unassuming price if i were pr i would repitch it with a marketing strategy and get back to basics theyre too bloated and monopolized to realize a blind test would put them in the top 5 american lagers i picture a small coors original shape bottle with the brown glass and the stubby style with the same price  ingredients water barley malt corn syrup maltose yeast hop extract
561,Coors Extra Gold,4.18,this here is a pretty goshdarn easy lager to enjoy folks unpretentious best appreciated very very cold a consistent pleasure for when what one wants is just a simple beer and as far as i can netinvestigate brewed only at the golden colorado brewery this is a fine excellent brew one i hope coorsmolson continues to brew  which it didnt so goodbye extra gold twas good to enjoyeth rip rest in recipe
562,Coors Extra Gold,4.58,i can barely tell it apart from banquet by flavor color slightly more golden excellent mf classic american lager
563,Coors Extra Gold,3.68,the color is extra golden actually more like copper with a quickly dissipating white head of foam  smells like it has a bit of some sour mash maybe like sour malts got it with that bread like lager smell this smells like a sourdough bread love it or leave it  the taste is pretty unremarkable or shocking tastes like a macro lager with a hint of sour the sour is not offensive or overpowering there is a bit of some sweet coming into play as well  mouth is a bit more towards medium with that unusual sour and sweet finishes easy with just a bit of oiliness  overall not a bad beer but more of what i would call it an inexpensive beer found this in a colorado liquor store for 1699 when i went back to denver for a bit this beer lends itself to be drinking it out of a can not a glass i dont even think it wants to be analyzed because i think the cans are saying just open me and drink the damn beer
564,Coors Extra Gold,4.55,i know opinions are like assholes everyone got one and they all stinkbut in my defense i drank this beer before i was of age and every now and again when i want to feel like im doing something wrong but still want to feel good about it i buy two twelve packs once they are gone i move on once a year is good enough for me its kinda like pizza even bad pizza is still kinda good cause i mean its pizza come on you with me
565,Labatt Blue,3.43,clear yellowgold with a short white head clinging in creamy doily lace  a touch of banana or zucchini bread accents toasted cracker and a surprisingly grassy bitterness in the finish theres maybe a ricey wax to it but less so than other aals  not nearly as bad as i thought this would be having been ages if ever since ive had it
566,Labatt Blue,2.85,poured a 473ml can onto a pint glass a one finger bubbly white head on a clear pale yellowthe head diminishes to a thin layer you can smell the corn from about two feet away a bit soapy initially a bit watery light body and carbonation no major faults goes down easy
567,Labatt Blue,3,lance storm would drink this beer if he could be serious a minute tastes like a canadian pbr the 112 oz bottles always put a frown on my face it was okay not a repurchase  style canadian lager  tapcanbottle bottle  abv 5  rating 3
568,Labatt Blue,3.52,decent canadian adjunct lager decent head that leaves you with some belgium lace in the end medium gold color nose of grass like hop aroma with some sweet corn like features taste reflective of the nose
569,Labatt Blue,3.58,pours a billowy white head decent retention smells of pale malt and slight alcohol refreshing lager that doesnt hit the wallet too hard pretty good for what it is
570,Labatt Blue,2.98,brought this beer to canadian friends house to watch the leafs in the playoffs the canadian beer did the leafs no favors but we had a great time drinking canadian beer with homemade pizza  anyway i had plenty of this beer while in grad school but not much lately it is a decent adjunct lager that tastes pretty good and has a nice sharp finish good for pizza and hockey games gave it 325 overall for old times sake
571,Labatt Blue,2.5,standard canadian lager
572,Labatt Blue,3.37,12oz can  on the pour one finger of white head formed with clouds of carbonation after the pour carbonation calms and head starts receding to a thin cap standard golden straw yellow  aroma is a touch corny with an almost lemony yeast aroma that stops just shy of the cheap beer aroma that you can get a lot of the time comes off as super bright and dry  taste is actually pretty good especially for a macro lager quite different than most macro usa lagers with a much brighter flavor up front that reminds me slightly of kona blond ale the finish has a light adjunct corn and malt flavor but it is very clean also very light  feel is light chuggable bright and refreshing still a full flavor brew and short of being a light lager quick finish in flavor but mouthfeel lingers a bit longer  overall this is probably one of the best beers ive had in the aal category and also one that stands out the most not the cheapest in the world but still quite affordable and that makes this a great value buy
573,Labatt Blue,3,not a bad time but there are better out there for the price decent taste and itll get ya where your going
574,Daisy Cutter,4.29,as mentioned all the time this beer is super dank for a pale ale really good thin mouth feel and an easy drink has all of the good characteristics of a pale ale and some great qualities of an ipa well worth searching for if not in the midwest well done
575,Daisy Cutter,3.76,poured from a freshness dated 16 oz can slightly hazy deep goldenorange with a sustained foamy white head  the aroma is mainly tropical fruit and some faint pine  the first sip just after pouring into the glass nearly took my head off because it was so bracingly bitter and seemed very thinbodied please let this one warm in the glass for a few minutes before quaffing as it will calm the bitterness and give flavors of bittersweet tropical fruit and mango as well as hints of pine this one drinks like an ipa to me i prefer my pales ales less bracing with a wellrounded body im still glad i tried it
576,Daisy Cutter,3.92,can dated 76 monthplus pours a amber nearing copper with a near clear body and a bunch of head lacing is a bit clumpy but pretty strong nose seems trying to throw a little citrus into a grassy bitterness along with some grain dry toast taste opens with a bit of a grain tea from lightly toasted malts this doesnt last too long on a cold beer but lingers longer on a warming beer grassy notes from the aroma grow out of this fairly steadily and into full strength at the finish a copper note leaks in on a cold beer but isnt really noticed at all at the preferred temp the beer is pretty dry which seems to accentuate the bitterness which turns a bit dank at the end and in the finish this offering from half acre has more of an old school ipa vibe to it than an actual ipa of theirs i recently tried
577,Daisy Cutter,4.18,pint can poured into a pint glass imagine that canned in chicago il on 61323 thats 25 days old we dont sometimes get cigar city jai alai that fresh 130 miles from the tit aroma of unoffensive pine and citrus zest taste bursts low and kinda dank a wave of malt is in the mix nice balanced finish mmmm really good dry finish mouthfeel is narrow center of the tongue medium carbonation suits it well overall a little beer that delivers a satisfying six minutes worth of your time
578,Daisy Cutter,2.92,this was from a bar so it may have been served too cold it has a transparent amber color with a mix of hop and malt aroma however i dont taste much theres a bit of watered down sweetness but thats about all she wrote for such a highly rated beer im disappointed
579,Daisy Cutter,3.56,this is a review of a 16 oz can from the bottom of the can 030 123b 3145 1451 n95  appearance the body of the beer is a darker shade of amber it has pretty good clarity with only a slight bit of haze there is a mediumlarge sized head which appears mostly white with a touch of a tan hue to it it has excellent head retention which is probably the greatest feature of the appearance the head overall looks really good on this beer there are a few splotches of lacing that form on the glass but not many and they are separated quite a bit  aroma there is a light but present aroma of pine with a touch of caramel a bit of an orange aroma comes through as well which blends with the caramel scent it smells nice  taste up front there is a candied orange peel flavor with a touch of caramel the middle of the palate has a biscuit flavor mixed with notes of lemon and lime it has a touch of alcohol flavor and a bit of grass near the back of the palate some pine grass and a light bit of alcohol in the aftertaste there is also a nice lemon and lime flavor in the aftertaste but it comes in after the other flavors fade out a bit  mouthfeel it has a medium perceived hop bitterness with a bit of a resinous texture to a body which feels mediumlight at some points and medium at others it is more textured and weighty than a standard pale ale it also feels like the bitterness is stronger than average it is still enjoyable to drink and it seems to fit this beer  overall the can states that this is a pale ale and doesnt appear to list an abv it is a nice beer that seems to drink a bit more like an ipa than a pale ale it will definitely deliver some nice flavors like the biscuit character some pine some orange and other citruses like lemon and lime it also is a bit grassy and comes through with alcohol character if you are an ipa lover who is looking for something with similar characteristics in a pale ale then you will probably enjoy this  if you enjoy a more tame and drinkable pale ale this might not be for you i could drink it again but it wouldnt replace a standard pale ale if that was what i was looking for this might be something i would buy if i wanted an ipa but wanted it to be lower abv
580,Daisy Cutter,3.83,i guess i was expecting more it is not my favorite pale ale poured from a 2 month old can into a sam smiths pint glass it produced a good but short lived head there is something kind of funky about the finish but the initial taste is pretty good
581,Daisy Cutter,3.77,appearance pours a pale golden color with a sticky offwhite foam head  aroma citrus pine and caramel malts  taste follows the nose citrus peel a little bit of pine and some caramel malts well balanced some some moderate bitterness that lingers into the finish  overall this is a pretty solid pale ale its simple the characteristics in both the aroma and taste are well balanced this one kills it with the drinkability
582,Daisy Cutter,4.15,imperial pint stovepipe presumably canned on january 5th 2023 hopefully this isnt a best by but if it is please let me know  on the pour a very nice 5 finger white sudsy head formed then over a couple minutes the bubble got bigger and the head lost 2 fingers so head retention is pretty good here body is a clear golden yellow legit pale ale look sudsy lacing forms  aroma is basically a bright slightly citrusy pine forest with hints of sweet wort and caramel malts super fresh and smells like pellet hops ive used while homebrewing perhaps an american and noble hop mix definitely fruity but herbal as well  taste follows the aroma but is more bitter than a lot of neipas out there i can see why the american pale ale style is falling by the wayside in favor of session hazies this is essentially a full flavored session wcipa in terms of the bitterness but being called a simple pale ale is still appropriate as after the citrusy and resinous bitter hops a lightly toasted and sweet malt backbone makes itself known im honestly upset ipas are taking over pale ales since the latter is basically a balanced but bitter wcipa when compared to a hazyneipa anyways i enjoyed this beer quite a lot hoppy but balanced by actual detectable malts this is what craft beer was aiming to be about 10 years ago before everyone got bored of beer flavor  feel is full without being heavy feels similar to a 6 abv ipa despite the lower abv full malty body with light astringency in the medium long finish dries out over the course of a drink  overall i greatly appreciate the balance of malt and hops here this is what i always imagined malt backbone meant but ive always been a malthead at the same time there is a solid resinous and grapefruit pithy hop bitterness caramel malt sweetness without being even an amber beer good stuff

584,Marshmallow Handjee,4.6,2022 vintage bottle 13163500  another milestone review number 1800 i figured since i have the highest rated ris on ba just sitting around that it would be a perfect time to break it out this is my first of any dark lord variant and i think its a damn good place to start for the series lets pop this legend open and see what it has to offer  pours almost completely pitch black with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  the roast is real in this one but its wonderfully offset by the sweeter notes as well im picking up on aromas of drip coffee burnt caramel dark toast milk chocolate tobacco vanilla bean molasses toasted oak fig and light cinnamon  its similar in taste but with even more of a depth making this one hell of a complex beer on the front end of the sip im tasting milk chocolate vanilla bean sweetened coffee toasted oak fig maple syrup burnt caramel sweet bourbon cinnamon black cherry and marshmallow the swallow brings notes of milk chocolate charred oak maple syrup burnt caramel black cherry fig vanilla bean allspice sweet bourbon marshmallow dark toast and tobacco  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth beer finishes mostly dry with just a touch of boozy heat  oh yeah this is amazing thankfully a beer that lives up to the hype maybe one day ill splurge on another bottle

590,La Folie,4.21,tasted from a 500 ml corked bottle in a red wine glass  l  beautiful ruby red color and very clear light tan head fades quickly to a thick ring around the glass and a few wisps on the surface swirling the beer reveals light lacing and legs on the glass like a strong wine shows  s  nose is an interesting blend of sweet brown ale with red wine and berry notes and a sharp acidic note with some barnyard funk at a low level  t  the barnyard funk and sour acidity dominate the flavors but is some depth that reveals other flavors i get blackberry jam and oak but the base of flemish brown ale is not detectable to me  f  thin body with low carbonation hops bitterness is not detectable because the acidic sourness is so strong it masks any other sensation on the tongue it also give a sharp bite in the throat alcohol presence is also drowned out by the acid except for some esters detectable in the finish  o  this is an unabashedly funky and sour beer but totally over the top compared to the belgian versions of flemish brown ive had still this does have delicate touches that make it more than just a sour monster
591,La Folie,3.6,balanced a little apple taste
592,La Folie,4.13,straight down the middle sour funky apple vinegar oak and cherry good carbonation and finishes dry earthy with barnyard grass malt oak barrel vanilla spicy caramel malt red wine hay and grape sour but not overly so the finish has a brown ale malty bluntness i went to college in boulder but this is my first time having this beer i see why it it is an american classic of searching for european greatness
593,La Folie,3.96,la folie  new belgium brewing company  sourflanders oud bruin  the classic sour produced way before it was mainstream popular this aged sour had tangy apple metallic sharp earthy funk cherries and amber malt aspects the french barrel flavor and feel is very mellow and provides an excellent subtle depth  400
594,La Folie,4.75,great example of the style well balanced and delicious just the right amount of sour and a wonderful depth of flavor just right for a before dinner quaff i love this beer
595,La Folie,4.93,sour taste apple  vinegar funky dry finish high carb all good for this style
596,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.7,i did everything possible not to like it  after serving it i could still smell it from two meters away   i tried it and although it does not reach the westy xii the only thing i can say while i continue to dislike it is that it is simply epic well deserved fame
597,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.3,poured into a gulden draak tulip pours a lightly hazy medium to dark brownish orange with a fizzy one finger khaki head that dissipates to patches with light lacing a bit of particulates at the bottom of the glass despite a calm pouraroma of dry caramel malt figs raisins dates and and some toffee flavor follows with deep caramel malt dried dark fruit particularly dates and raisins brown bread and cloves finishes a bit minierally but with residual dark fruit medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess has a much brighter flavor profile than any dubbel ive had before almost a belgian dark ale flavor this is undoubtedly due to this having a bit of age to it with a best buy date of 2019 so likely about 8 years old probably my only chance to try this so i grabbed a bottle despite the assumed lighter characater for aging has a deep malt and great fruit notes a slight sharpness mineral in the finish but the residual fruit flavors make up for it this makes me really want to try a fresher bottle but im still impressed with the malty flavor depth of the 8 not quite a deep and malty as 12 but fine a rare treat ive wanted to try something from this brewery since i started my interest in craft beers and glad to try the dubbel and quad
598,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.53,poured more beige foam than walnut colored beer into the glass so i guess the unknown age of the beer isnt too old the aroma was pretty mild for me due to covid messing with my sense of smell but i did get some dark fruit and chocolate and spice had to be potent for me to get any of that the flavor was really really good dark fruit and dark chocolate and a menagerie of spices that were all wrapped up in what seemed like champagne flavors and texture the feel was excellent the massive head didnt dissipate the carbonation that i could tell and somehow that is what made it all work together maybe the bite of the bubbles kept it from getting too sweet not sure but darned good dubbel
599,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.25,from 101621
600,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.28,2011 vintage  well it may be a bit older than is ideal but im very excited to try westy 8 the highest rated dubbel on ba after having the 12 for the first time just a few weeks ago and loving it i knew i had to seek out some of this too i managed to end up with 1 bottle each of 2010 and 2011 so i figured id drink the slightly newer one first lets see what its all about  pours an opaque medium brown with just a ring of light tan bubbles that leaves no lacing  theres a surprising boozy bite in the nose here given its only 8 im picking up on aromas of dark bread burnt caramel sweet bourbon raisin brown sugar honey pear skin and light clove  even 11 years out this has a great presence in taste on the front end of the sip im tasting black cherry dark bread candi sugar pear skin light floral hops overripe banana and plum the swallow brings notes of dark toast raisin red grape sweet caramel toffee sticky molasses and light honey  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth and silky beer finishes mostly dry with a nice fruity sweetness  its certainly not the ideal to have this so old so i have to bump it a bit in the overall i can see what used to be there when it was fresh and i hope one day to be able to try it fresh either way its an awesome beer
601,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.5,brownred foamy long lasting dark fruits cherry raisins  typical belgian yeast also sherryport wine tastes creamysmooth some acidity some spices some bitterness in the finish  overall many similarities to westy 12 but a bit more toned down less sweet
602,Framboos,4.29,look  clear copper with nice white head incredible rimming smell and taste  funky grainy raspberry feel  medium body fizzy slight bite overall  really fantastic
603,Framboos,4.6,bottled 18 dec 2019 reviewed 16 june 2023  a pous crystal clear copper in color moderate sized bright white head dissipates quickly leaving no lacing looks still in the glasss 425  s aroma is immediate raspberries hay and raw wheat initially quite floral which then cedes to funky notes of slightly pungent cheese i cant say that it smells particularly sour but theres some lactic tartness and citrus rind quite complex and a wonderful nose 475  t taste follows with a big plastic like funk up front which quickly yields to floral and citrus notes with big oaky vanilla on the finish that lingers forever taste is quite tart and sour but its not as puckering as many lambics the raspberry characters are present but certainly not prominent not sure to what extent thats due to the age 45  md mouthfeel is lighter side of medium bodied with a big but appropriate carbonation and incredible drinkability i could drink this all day 5  o a wonderful beer no doubt not sure if it was worth the difficulty in obtaining as i think i prefer cantillon rose de gabrinus when it comes to raspberry lambics and ive surprisingly found the other easy to get over the years regardless still wonderful and i would have a fridge full of this on the regular if it was readily available 45
604,Framboos,4.51,375 ml bottle bottling date 18dec19 best before 26 oct 39  gentle to moderate pour yields a one inch white head over a hazy solid golden body with fleeting lacing  nose of funk oak and raspberries  taste mirrors nose with mostly tart raspberry flavors oak tannins and funk  wonderful mouthfeel almost perfect for the style  overall i know its quite expensive at 2999 a 375 ml bottle but do yourself a favor and grab one if you see one cheers
605,Framboos,4.32,i picked this up last week at vintage estates wine and beer in boardman oh my favorite beer store this 375 ml was very expensive but i have been after this beer for 15 years also got hommage and may save that for beer ratingreview 2k bottled on 18 dec 2019  a body is a uniformly hazy orange with a hint of pink perhaps sunset in color there is no head or lacing to speak of  s the nose is complex yet simple tart raspberries cheesecloth funk oak barrel breadiness  t the flavor is much like the nose sweet and tart authentic raspberries upfront with a light bready yeast backbone the finish is quite sour but a softness from the oak barrel lingers on with some sourness long after you swallow  f medium carbonation and a medium weight body there is a lot of acidity in the body with a light bread yeast feel too  o this beer is truly world class its the definition of a traditional fruit lambic and it is brewed so carefully and so well it definitely gets better and you appreciate it more as it goes down its quite expensive so if you dont like more traditional sours or you dont like raspberries than dont bother
606,Framboos,4.6,l pours a nice dark red pink color with a small foamy head that dissipates rather quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass  s lots of earthy funky brett hit the nose followed by a good tart raspberry and some other tart fruit  t lots of earthy funk tart and sour mix well with the brett and then finishes with a touch of raspberry utterly fantastic  f good fizzy carbonation and medium body  o this beer is utterly fantastic
607,Framboos,4.55,slightly hazy dark pink body the haze is possibly due to my practice of not decanting belgian beers  impressively earthy and funky on the nose theres a hint of raspberry but it doesnt stand out strongly  wonderful raspberry flavor on the palate without overwhelming moderately sour but more funky not quite as delicate as other fruited lambics drinks a bit fuller than the 5 abv would suggest
608,Framboos,4.24,375 ml bottle 20182019 vintage poured into a snifter pours a clear dark yellowpink not much of a head or lacing the bottom of the bottle contains lots of yeastsediment which changes the appearance to turbid dark brownred aroma features fresh raspberries and funk leather barnyard with some oak and malt some green applelemon as well flavor is similar but with a malty sweetness that i cant quite describe almost like someone added a shot of simple syrup this detracts from the overall flavor profile moderate tartness moderate funk nice fruit overall its solid but not something id feel the need to buy again maybe its better with less time in the bottle but then again it does claim to have a 20year drinking window

610,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,2.62,ended up in my beer cart by accident expected the worst but was actually a wee   bit surprised essentially a tacky cheap slightly malty adjunct lager ok nothing special  a pabst
611,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.56,very refreshing malt liquor smooth malty bready nice gold color and cheap not the best of the malt liquor family but definitely a drink i would recommend for my fellow malt liquor beginners
612,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,1.15,this is the most disgusting skunky garbage i have ever consumed i thought olde english was bad but this is somehow even worse and i went in with low expectations it tastes like someone drank too much beer and pissed into a can the only thing it has going for it is the abv  grab a 6 pack of carling ice before you reach for colt
613,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.26,pours a fine looking beer actually raiting this based off the 40 oz i opened a few weeks back poured one pint of and twisted the cap back on worth nothing its glass 40 oz honestly i went to pour it out and heard a nice big hiss saw the beer do some fuckin science in the glass so i poured the thing in my glass turned out to be a good move its a solid unpretentious american hellesbock head stayed on like a miller beer would tastes like a pabst extra rated to style
614,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.3,this was a beer reminding me of my high school days and nights of drinking beers when we could get them nice to see that it is still around poured a golden color with a fairly thick white head and very bubbly the smell was malt corn bread and hops the taste was malt bread and hops
615,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.59,pours a crystal clear golden yellow color with a bite head smell is corn malt wheat and hay taste follows nose some citrus hops cracker meal malt grassy herbal note  mouth feel is not boozy has a sweetness to it could drink another for sure
616,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.17,from a 24oz can  appearance clear yellowgold huge head  smell sweet corn some stale hay  taste sweet slight corn sweet fruitinessslight pear note medium to light body sweetness lingers somewhat in the finish  overall what better than some malt liquor over the 4th of july weekend finally trying the legendary colt 45 as one of the local stores had it in 24oz cans not too bad as with most in the style you want to drink it cold no major flaws a solid malt liquor thats up there with oe800 and mickeys as good ones in the style
617,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.26,got a 24oz can best by august 1st poured into my warsteiner pils glass just for fun  on the pour a 1ish finger head forms then becomes fizzy amd recedes to a ring around the glass amd light covering crystal clear generic lager color a light straw gold with lively carbonation looks like a decent cheap beer and it almost wants to lace  the nose is surprisingly decent especially for the style some slight green apple off notes right up front but not too far behind is an actual bready malt aroma that is present possibly even some cheap but detectable hops on the nose there is a bit of oxidized notes but this is way better than olde english 800 for sure as it warms the green apple flavor grows and becomes almost unpleasant but its really just a cheap lager note that i get a lot in aal beers a lot more than im getting in this one  flavor follows the aroma bringing a bit of corniness along with the malts the hops largely disappear leaving only a hint of bitterness right up front that mingles with a bit of the green apple then gives way to a largely pleasant and almost soft bready and corny maltgrain flavor coming in with low expectations i was very pleasantly surprised  feel is at first sip a bit watery with a quick finish and a big hit of carbonation bite but as you drink more it hits the stomach quite heavily making this quite filling which is a bit of a curve ball after everything else about this beer made me forget that technically this is a malt liquor no complaints really however as this is the only spot that has even been close to reminding me what kind of beer im drinking  overall ive had beers that where a whole lot worse than this obviously ive had better but this is almost a decent american style lager and at only 56 its really not all that big a beer by todays standards the only thing really making this a malt liquor is that its been around since the only choices were bud miller and coors and its a bit stronger than those bmc beers taste is actually surprisingly high quality for what it is
618,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,2,use only in extreme emergencies if you are a poor high school kid almost enough nostalgia to make me want to revisit in the current age and see what its all about the keyword being almost haha who knows
619,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,2.39,24oz can  poured this out bc im a maniac big lenny style and its beautiful big lenny style smells like corn hops and rot taste is heavy on that spoiled garbage juice flavor that i guess some people are keen on terrible even for the style but it gets ya drunk

628,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.14,500ml bottle with the new nonsense date code  on the pour 2 fingers of off white to tan head that became rocky and a bit foamy over a few minutes until finally settling at a decent tan cap body is a dark amber to copper with a bit of haze but light still comes through  aroma carries sweet fig and toffeecaramel but there is a slight savory oxidation thing going on alcohol isnoticeable but not boozy  taste follows the sweet malty notes but loses the off notes im going to blame the aroma on bottle age which for now is unfortunately uncontrollable traditional banana hefeweizen flavor comes through with a sweet caramelized flavor coming from the malts honestly very easy to drink and comes off as a dunkelweizen to my untrained american palate still there is some light figgy fruit going on but this is mostly a very enjoyable dark strong traditional tasting hefeweizen nice balancing hop bitterness but no hop aromas   feel is smooth and easy drinking this beer hides its abv well once its on your palate slight astringency but this isnt a dry beer at the same time this beer doesnt come off as huge and thick the astringency balances the malt well leading to the easy drinking feel of this medium long finish but its subtle soft subtle but present carbonation  overall there are flaws but this is one of my favorite general doppelbock style beers ive ever had although it is the only weizendoppelbock ive tried nice traditional hefeweizen flavor merged with delicious caramel sweet malts as well as a nice balancing bitterness smells a bit funny when it gets old though

635,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,3.62,purchaed at the athens oh brewery in june 2023 poured at 56 thin layer of rocky tan bubbles which vanished quickly leaving no cap retention ring nor lace no legs black with ruby edges spicy nose followed by chocolate and a bit of bourbon hot spicyboozy 137 retro nasal spicy hot green chilies sauce entry black pepper chocolate oreo cookies come to mind bourbon cinnamon as beer warms minimal vanilla no walnuts from the the base beer hot mouth warmth from habaneros spices and alcohol thin watery body light carbonation overall unbalanced my mouth is on fire its so hot the beer burns all the way down my gullet not enjoyable i like spicy mexican cake style stouts but this beer is extreme glad i only bought one
636,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,3.88,20230703 375ml bottle served in a little snulip vintage 2022 got it from ozzylizard in nbs bif 17  pours black with no head looks still smell is bourbon and vanilla burnt toffee and nearburnt nuts sweet molasses hint of something like cinnamon or nutmeg  taste is for me dominated by cinnamon nuts are still there and something comes across as milk chocolate molasses sweetness i was feeling a little bit of spice on my lips and thinking it was a bit odd for cinnamon to have that much power but not be totally overwhelming for me and then i read on the label that it contains habaneros and thats clearly evident now that i saw it as its warming up the cinnamon is becoming even more powerful  mouthfeel is nicely thick and chewy overallit appears to be a pretty good stout with a nice level of pepper but too much cinnamon for me
637,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,5,i fell in love with this beer from the beauty on the label to the deep dark color to smooth finish i used to drive all the way to danvers to purchase it at total wine then covid hit are you going to brew up a new batch i would buy an extra large tee shirt of the lovely lady and walk around as free advertising too
638,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.3,bourbon barrel oro negro from jackie os 127 oz bottle received from brewery 050423 reviewed 100423 review 3070 note that i use ddmmyy protocol printed on the label 2022 stored at 34 degrees at home served at 546 degrees f in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter the final temperature was 590 degrees f appearance  375 first pour  ruby brown srm 24 almost opaque body  deep brown srm 30 opaque under direct light same when rear lite shows a translucent olive at the top edge and ruby at the bottom head  none while pouring a five mm crescent of large bubbles appears on about a third of the circumference but quickly evaporates lacing  none aroma  425  bourbon and barrel are the predominant aromas no malt no yeast no hops no chocolate oddly no habaneros no ethanol 137  abv as marked on the label aroma flavor  45  the habaneros set up a nice oral burn not too hot and lacking any vegetal flavor cinnamon rides in on the aftertaste initially no hops malt or yeast light chocolate and ghostly vanilla slight gastric warming but that could be from capsaicin as well as ethanol no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl palate  4  medium creamy soft carbonation final impression and summation 425 lacking both head and lacing the appearance loses a few points both the flavor and aroma are quite good with distinct hits of habaneros cinnamon cocoa and even detectable vanilla all supported by the bourbon and barrel very good and well worth grabbing if you run across a bottle or six extra points for having a lizard on the label
639,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.4,poured from a 127 ounce bottle the body is a dark cola brown small initial head that quickly dissipated and no lacing of consequence  aroma is a complex mix of bourbon cinnamon vanilla and chile the habanero aroma is muted but present  taste follows nose though the barrel is a tad sweeter than the nose youll need to be patient to pick up the notes of walnut and oak rising from the stout upon which this beer was made oil of aphrodite the habanero is felt in the swallow but its a light heat in fairness i love habs and you might perceive more heat the cinnamon and cacao nibs balance the pepper and the barrel holds everything together in an unlikely tasty stout a bit more malty char would be welcome but thats a personal preference and not a complaint  mouthfeel is good but not great id love a bit more body in this stout more carbonation would be welcome  overall an outstanding stout that i interestingly found a bit better when colder than i usually drink stouts the mix seemed more flavorful when first poured
640,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.46,this is a very nice stout  cinnamon and cacao nibs with a bakers chocolate taste then the heat from the peppers nice barrel but not overpowering i really enjoyed this
641,Vintage Ale,3.91,2018 vintage ale
642,Vintage Ale,5,review 3000  enjoyed at the end of 2022 bottle no 143884  pours a wonderful caramelburgundy with a thick layer of cocoa colored foam on top the aroma is fantastic with layers of stone fruit plummy jammy raisin with hints of dark chocolate leather and tobacco on the end the sip follows creamy with a lingering finish subtly sweet with an effervescence that keeps it lively a delightful sipper utterly fantastic
643,Vintage Ale,4.66,had 2010 bottle that has been cellared 12 years at last i finally got to try this one only took coming to london itself pours dark brown and murky with a short lived tan cap nose has a sherry note to it the wife say cognac either way this sweeter booziness is met with caramel oxidized apricot date barley and leather taste adds a bevy of dark fruit golden raisin and a kiss of fresh cut hay on the end with the old yeast so luxuriously smooth sneaky light quenching and dry with a whisper of resin this one is special for its style paired wonderfully with a pub sunday roast
644,Vintage Ale,4.21,2019 vint bottle 06240 poured at fridge temp into a snifter theres a casual head that lasts only a little while color is dark amber smell is sweet malt stone fruit light caramel taste is cherryish sweet toffee hops are evident but balance well within the overall profile no real bitterness to be found feel is light carbonation smooth overall despite being bottle conditioned i cant imagine that anything else would develop by cellaring this beauty any longer its packaging presentation look feel and taste are spoton right now
645,Vintage Ale,4.21,2016 vintage drank in 2022 amazingly rich flavor and solid carbonation complex and delicious
646,Vintage Ale,4.5,2021 vintage bottle 139563  a pours a lovely orange hued dark bronze color is semi opaque and the head which is about two fingers thick shows a shade of creamy white with toffee infusion the carbonation appears to be somewhat mellow with only a few columns slumbering there way upward with the lacing showing rather well and stickily i am being painted a grouping of cave art like animals around the inside of the glassvery nice looking overall  s heavy malt profile here with plenty of carameltoffee sweetness dark fruit flesh such as plum and fig richness various citrus nuances tangerine blood orange grapefruit pomello and a sweet alcoholic nature of rum soaked raisins the finish has some interesting fruity bitter hops which would explain what i read about the experimental cf182 variety being used herei even detect some pineapple tropical like aromas on the end  t very well balanced overall with a wonderful blend of toffeecaramel malt sweetness rummy raisinplumfig richness slight orchard fruitiness after i get through all of this my palate is hit once again by a second round of malt bombfull of sweet cooked brown sugar dark toffee molasses sugarcane and dulce de leche the finish showcases some very british flavors found in traditional pale aleszesty citrus peel tropical fruitiness and dry leafy herbal tones quenching the palate and leading me on to want more  mo ive enjoyed aged vintages from fullers before and this is the first time ive had one right after releasei have to say that i am impressed with the overall flavors and richness for something so fresh the carbonation is smooth and allows the full flavors to release onto the palate gently while the body is somewhere in the mediumfull range the alcohol is incredibly well hidden and soft for an 85 brew but i dont believe this would be something with a high drinkability factorone is plenty in a sitting i appreciate the usage of experimental hops and the attempt to create something unique which i think fits the bill hereoverall this is an exceptional english style pale ale and would become a great old ale after several years of aging
647,Vintage Ale,4.18,this one isnt hog wild  and it isnt supposed to be but what i feel what it does to me is remind me of a gentle moment a moment with her not the one that was meant for me but one that still gave me that night and made me feel ill always remember you baby even if you arent in my trophy case  be well my children
648,Vintage Ale,3.39,500 ml bottle vintage 2020 pours murky amber smells of cardboard right off the bat spicy hops with some berry fruitiness behind it deep caramel undertones tastes of sweet caramel with a combination of spicy and again berry fruity hops cardboard isnt as noticeable here as its got a pronounced hop bitterness still has a little bit though medium heavy fairly sweet not boozy but hits hard after a few sips i picked this up because i havent seen one in a long time my memory of this is fonder than the current experience
649,Vintage Ale,4.34,2021 vintage excellent 2017 vintage
650,Vintage Ale,4.37,teste licorice smoke sweet pastry smells berries light carbonation small head color is cloudy black tea
651,Vintage Ale,4.24,beautifully clear copperred under a wellretaining khaki head that slowly settles to an unevenly bubbly yet flat collar  while it may be mildly unfair for me to rate this 2010 bottle straight up its clearly intended for extensive aging which i dont feel caused it much detriment anyway  that said it exhibits distinct characteristics of grape and prune and as such lands well within the intended range of emulating wine these characteristics are accented by softly light notes of pumpernickel and melba toast before exhaling floral tobacco  the body is smoothly slick with a lightly soft carbonation that fines out into a faintly tingling slightly numbing semidry finish over time that leafy floral tobacco verges into cigar skin to delicately dry the palate out further
652,Vintage Ale,4.28,amber with a touch of red and a finger of tan foamy head cherries tart apples on the nose with caramel tangerine almond toffee and malt at the end you really have to work to pick things out though the caramel and malt show up big in the taste there is bread pudding with raisins and brown sugar medium bitterness closes this out the feel is light carbonation and a nice creaminess i love the bread pudding aspect of this i would totally drink this again and would recommend
653,Vintage Ale,4.76,2020 vintage  nice traditional and luxurious packaging nice collectible bottle pours a lovely deep mahogany slightly hazy with two smooth fingers of offwhite beigetinged head that recede slowly and shockingly stick around for the entire pint despite the 85 alcohol content which took me over 20 minutes to finish the smell whollops you over the head with fruits like blackberry and plum ethanol is present but far from obtrusive the dark fruit profile carries forward into the taste complemented by marmalade chocolate notes subtle caramel and even subtler earthy zesty hops the mouthfeel is smooth as silk the ethanol noticeable  at 85 theres no way around that  but incorporated into the flavour profile overall a delicious complex smooth and very special beer
654,Vintage Ale,4.51,2011
655,Vintage Ale,4.08,2014 vintage  appearance  pours hazy and burnt amber in color sandstone colored finger width head that holds for a minute or so before scaling down to a thin broken layer of suds on the surface thickening up around the edge of the glass fair lacing with some streaky lines and small spots making up most of it  smell  raisin and toffee upfront with some caramel oak nutty character and some booze  taste  follows the nose toffee and raisin hit the palate first with lesser caramel oak and maybe even a hint of chocolate midtaste finish adds some mild acidic booze and a bit of almond reminiscent of sherry and the aftertaste is a nice easy blend of the aforementioned flavors easing out slowly  mouthfeel  lighttomedium in body with low carbonation drinks smooth enough though does seem a bit thin perhaps due to the 7 years of age its been afforded  overall  nice old ale it doesnt quite do it for me like north coast old stock which is more fullbodied and flavored but it does have some similar qualities i wouldnt mind trying this fresh or with a few years of age on it though it looks like they change up the hop profile every year

670,Moinette Blond,4.23,330 ml bottle from the lcbo best before aug 2022 and served at cellar temperature  pours a bright clear goldenyellow hue producing just over a finger of foamy sparkling white head it withers away over the next several minutes leaving behind a thin cap and wide frothy collar with a narrow band of lace also having been deposited im getting orchard fruits and yeastiness on the nose  appleskin clove and white pepper with hints of banana pear and candi sugar sweetness all layered atop of a bready pale malt backdrop not bad at all  a quality belgian strong ale the flavours follow the nose with grainy bready pale malts providing support for notes of apple white grape apricot and pear hints of lemony citrus and bubblegum crop up as well with yeasty spicy aspects of clove towards the finish and just a tad of floral hops  earthiness into the aftertaste mediumfull in body with moderate carbonation levels that froth up in the mouth a little gently tickling the tongue feels smooth and velvety soft in the mouth the 85 is a tad noticeable but not in an intrusive way as it blends into the profile quite effectively if it werent for the small serving size this might be a much more dangerous beer particularly given the ease with which i tossed it back  final grade 423 an excellent a moinette blonde is a very solid bspa that i enjoyed the hell out of now i dont know if id put it on the same pedestal as duvel but in terms of quality its at least in the vicinity of that ballpark the stock around here is beginning to dwindle but hopefully ill manage to pick up another bottle or two for short term less than 2 y storage in the cellar highly recommended to any ba with an appreciation for belgian pale ales
671,Moinette Blond,3.77,this is a refreshing beer you taste the belgium style slight hops light citrus malt aroma smooth to the pallet and a nice aftertaste this is a great belgium pale ale and probably one of the better ones ive had definitely a summer drink and dangerous for 85 abv
672,Moinette Blond,3.95,the look is lovely belgian and the nose is equally good funky saison but the taste is somewhat disappointing its a bit fizzy haltingly dry and just an overall weaker sister of st feuillien grand cru to which this seems to inspire but cannot reach really you could do worse if nothing is available in its class otherwisemeh
673,Moinette Blond,4.1,color of light shimmering gold with white cap and lacing  a clean aroma of ripe fruits such as apricot pear and peach  taste is a combination of the scent fruits along with touches of yeast rolls and a bit of spice cant quite nail down the spice as its very light but cinnamon and clove come to mind complex sophisticated and quite refreshing  light to medium texture with balancing carbonation  in scent texture and taste this is a good deal milder than i usually get from a belgian blond not de minimis but certainly no block buster
674,Moinette Blond,4.26,330 ml bottle served very cool into a chalice lcbo purchase for about 335cdn best before august 2022  appearance  hazy rich dark golden color capped with a finger of white head that actually fizzles out much quicker than i thought it would sparse lacing clings to the edges of the glass  smell  powdery yeast bready donuts some fruit namely apple pear and peach inviting and warm a touch perfumey as well  taste  light and bready some funky yeast slight bits of candi sugar and more sweet fruits apple and pears most with a peachy sensation so good and easy to drink  mouthfeel  medium bodied booze is so well hidden and well carbonation fizzy and expressive without being gassy 85 abv is wonderfully hidden  overall  yeah a strong belgian pale ale brewed by dupont what where you expecting delicious and inviting its not quite duvel but pretty much the next best thing in the style really should try to do a comparison between this la chouffe duvel and delirium seems like a fairly even 4 way fight for supremacy and what could wrong in that situation
675,Colt 45 Strong Beer,1,while i am not aware of the legal classification that governments what is or isnt a malt liquor but i am sure the guidelines are not very strict  the aroma is a pungent sugary sweet corn scent mixed with a malty dank alcoholic warmth from the first sip you will realize that is marketed as less of a beverage and more of a means to reach intoxication sugary cereal mixed with corn make up the body then hot gross sweetness like you get acid reflux  smells almost like rubbing alcohol tastes like the surgeon generals warning unless you are on very hard times and someone has offered you this for free please avoid this and stop buying this this is no good reason why this is produced far worse than olde english just a note reference point
676,Colt 45 Strong Beer,2.78,710ml can a seven ten apparently  i have my reasons which are essentially along the lines of pouring one out for a friends dog  rest in puppy peace czar  this beer pours a clear bright medium golden yellow colour with four fingers of puffy finely foamy and only faintly fizzy offwhite head which leaves some random splotchy lace around the glass as it slowly and evenly abates  it smells of gritty and grainy cereal malt dextrose corn pops white grape juice and rubbing alcohol the taste is bready and doughy er malt simple syrup white wine dregs the water in which you boiled the corn sugary booze and some ethereal earthy and dead floral bitterness  the carbonation is pretty unremarkable in its milquetoast frothiness the body a solid middleweight and actually fairly smooth with only the firewater essence maybe acting as the fly in the proverbial ointment to wit it finishes offdry the generic malt and muted frooty notes fixing for a lingering donnybrook  overall  yeppers this is exactly what the doctor a known quack but still ordered and actually quite tolerable when fridgecold however the honeymoon fades fast as things start to warm so id say that puts this one smack dab dead center in the bullseye of this style amirite
677,Colt 45 Strong Beer,1.5,first sips its bad a few sips later its so bad its good after a few more its so sobaditsgood that it circles right back round to plain bad again
678,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.33,bottled 10521  this is cantillons most popular beer and im somehow only getting to it now i was originally intending to just buy another bottle of fou foune from mbc but when i saw the seller had this one available for a good price i figured i had to get it lets pop it open and see what it has to offer  pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  theres a lot of funk in the nose here but its very well integrated im picking up on aromas of wet hay sharp oak lemon zest wildflower honey crabapple white wine vinegar white pepper light cracker and pear  the funk is certainly more aggressive in taste though its more than welcome here on the front end of the sip im tasting lemon juice earthy wheat sharp oak white wine vinegar crabapple pear skin wet hay jammy apricot and white pepper the swallow brings notes of lemon juice wildflower honey crabapple sharp oak white wine vinegar pear skin jammy apricot earthy wheat tobacco light cracker and a touch of smoke  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a sharp yet slick beer finishes oddly sticky but eventually dries out  this is wonderful but im honestly a bit surprised that its not super dry the sticky finish takes away from the experience a bit but overall its still a great expereince
679,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.5,750 ml bottle split with my wife poured into red wine glasses 2019 vintage this is a wonderfully complex gueuze green apple plentiful but not overwhelming acidity leather funk oak tannins and a hint of vinegar are the primary flavor notes mouthfeel has average carbonation and a dry finish stellar
680,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.34,750ml bottle poured into tulip date on bottle says december of 21  pours a deep golden orange with half a finger of dirty white head that leaves clouds of lace as it recedes  smells of white wine vinegar sour green apples zesty oranges juicy stone fruit barrel wood and some lacto funk  tastes more fruitforward apricot pineapple sour apple navel orange more sharp vinegar barnyard funk and barrel staves  feels smooth and delicate light bodied with soft carbonation finishes sour and fruity  verdict vigorously recommended world class for sure
681,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.5,got one from taiwan and one from la village de la biere in strasbourg great example of the style
682,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.49,2500th review its only been 95 years super excited to try this legendary cantillon as ive been sitting on it for a few months hoping for a milestone brew 2021 bottling and purchased from durand for a small but worthwhile fortune my first loon served cold into a goblet  appearance  picturesque bright golden color with a small amount of haze a finger of small soapy cap that continues to fizzle on as more head forms from the bubbles rising in the glass  smell  tartness with subtle bits of cherry apple skins woody and slightly musty barrel some earthy funk theres sort of a deep underlying sweetness there too that ties all the aromas together  taste  a little sourness and green apple tartness elements of wood and musty barrel light grapey qualities too funky without being too far out in left field cohesive in the flavors a slightly spicy element in the aftermath maybe as it warms the woody barrel note seems to be elevated with a trace of honey depth of flavor is awesome and lingers on really well in the aftertaste  mouthfeel  mediumlight body good expressive carbonation and very dry finish  overall  awesome sour beer the depth is unreal and its difficult to decipher everything youre tasting super stoked to have finally tried this and boy does it ever live up to expectations one of my best new beers of 2022 and a very worthy milestone brew absolutely worth trying if you can a find it and b afford it
683,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.49,september 2021 bottle  looks slightly cloudy orangegold no head or legs  smells sour and funky lots of fruit for an unfruited lambic bacteria are amazing hey i get apricot orange zest citron green apple pineapple wood a bit of bread and apple cider vinegar levels of fermentation  tastes similar to the nose but less fruity mostly apricot citrus and green apple plus the woodiness and bready malt with the sourness and funk being more prominent gave me a big initial pucker but was smooth after  feels nice medium body a slight fuzzy carbonation that doesnt linger very long  overall heck yeah awesome gueuze lives up to the cantillon hype even if its not mindblowing
684,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.34,a 750ml corked and capped bottle 2021 season bottled on 1st october 2020 poured into a 3 fonteinen gueuze glass  appearance a mostly clear golden orange colour with a big two finger white head that had pretty good retention and eventually settled to a thin cap while leaving some nice lacing  aroma sour tart funky musty wet wood green apple grapefruit zest with a touch of white grapes  taste sour tart slightly sweet funky oak apricot with some light lemon zesty notes  mouthfeel light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation  overall a nice enjoyable easy to drink gueuze perfect for a hot summer day
685,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.42,smell of tart cherries and some yeasty bread orangeish pour with visible active carbonation flavor is tart but nothing like the kettle sours of today more balanced and smooth enough to allow for the fruit notes to come through this is surprisingly mellow in the finish with the bready notes of the yeast taking hold  my first cantillon offering and shared with a couple friends at monks cafe in philly absolutely a must try for any beer enthusiast
686,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.19,bottle pour opaque dark golden color with quickly dissipating white head nose is a bit funky with hints of tart fruit and yeast taste follows with a a tart and tangy crispness an interesting brew that i liked more than expected
687,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.41,rich gold body is almost copper clear and shining forming a fine fizzy head off white and holding retention for a little over a minute before dwindling to a thin layer aroma is lightly tart and fruity like white grapes wheat honey fresh bright and light  feels like summer in an orchard reminiscent of spanish sidre with flavours of crisp sweettart apples and hay with a whisper of funk a light lactic tang the freshest mountain water oak its the perfect level of sourness enough to make you smack your lips but not pucker the finish is dry and flavour lingers the feel is prickly and finely effervescent medium bodied crisp yet silky  beautiful in its simplicity and refinement not particularly complex it is pure and deftly crafted and approachable
688,Gueuze 100% Lambic,1.11,cantillon brewery brussels  looked tasted felt like vomit resulted from alcohol poisoning  horrendous  gex

702,Famosa (Gallo),2,picked up a 15 pack of cans expecting very little indeed it is everything you would expect it to be and less if average fizzy lager were to be a rooster and espanol it would appear in 2d and be on a 3d can no need to mention anything else about the beer drink it cold
703,Famosa (Gallo),2.48,look it pours golden and clear with a white head head retention is low  smell it has corn aromas with some grass there are hints of sweetness in the background  taste there are corn flavors and it is quite syrupy there are some grassy hops in the background  feel it has a medium light body and it finishes sweet  overall the flavors are standard for pale lagers but the syrup notes are quite different
704,Famosa (Gallo),3.24,from a 12 oz can with a bb date of mar 2024 theyre optimistic since im sampling it may 25 2023  goldenyellow appearance with great clarity and a modest white head busy carbonation  typical mass produced aroma of cooked grain bread corn syrup and a whiff of floral or grassy hops  light to medium mouthfeel better than some of its ilk  sweet grainy and bready taste nothing that really stands out crisp finish easy to pound it down

708,Famosa (Gallo),5,its not gallo beer being rated here it is famosa beer being rated its like an american version of sofia vergara it doesnt compare
709,Famosa (Gallo),2.75,its pretty average very light in color with minimal head slightly skunky bready non offensive flavor quickly dissipating head almost non existent easily poundable and inexpensive on sale at 10 bucks a 12 pack at fresco here in central florida overall average af to say the least though drinkable and not undesirable for a cheap summertime brew not bad nice and light with a slight bit of flavor and hugely refreshing although i prefer icehouse or budweiser to this stuff to be honest definitely not my weekend truck washing grass cutting beer for sure but i would take it over natty ice any day great brew to try out if you havent already but wont be rushing back for more its ok if ya get it on sale worth a shot
710,Famosa (Gallo),1.38,shared bottle at local tasting as famosa pale golden colour low white head artificial and chemical sweetish  sourish aroma sourish flavour otherwise bland as hell dust no bitterness
711,Famosa (Gallo),3.73,funny that this is rated as awful for what this is and the travel it goes through as well and the unique quality it has over other beers from its region make me question if reviewers are simply saying its bad because its not an imp stout or ipa  it looks like every other adjunct lager yes but the smells are spicy and herbal underlying beneath a cracker base the flavor follows the nose and is pretty unique given the region and style it comes from as previously stated the feel is light enough and inoffensive  if you are comparing this beer to american craft beers then youre doing it wrong if all you drink is a dipa then why even bother with this from a point of view of this thats why i believe the rating is low if you like clean lagers then this is a great beer

715,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.57,pours a hazy golden not in an ipa way but a regular beer way frothy looking head fresh cut apples some meyer lemon on the nose sweet champagnelike cider notes up front that is confronted by some sharp acidity it is overall the right amount of acidity with the acidity presented in a very nice way this is really nice as advertised

718,I.C. Light Mango,5,not a fan of flavored beers in general but this oneis amazingly refreshing on a hot summer day still has that beer balance with a not overwhelming mango finish mango may be the best flavoring for beerat least go the iron city brand a great beer in general  iron city got a bad rap when the actually moved out of the city however they are back but still having trouble getting tap space in bars they were ubiquitous in bars before the move all their beer are great in general
719,I.C. Light Mango,5,love this beer it is a great beer from iron city come on its soo much better than iron city its a fun beer and its soo sad that iron city does a poor job marketing this i also feel its very sad that the local places dont carry it and that it is sooooo very hard to get it at pnc park heinz and ppg come on its a freaking local beer its good show your support
720,I.C. Light Mango,3.37,amber lager deeper color than a light beer fruit straight away mango definitely sweet to start the slow to sour carbonated but then quickly to a traditional light beer overall a yummy summer beer will keep on hand for hot days
721,I.C. Light Mango,4.69,this one slaps beyond belief top tier beverage for sure if you dont back this brew i honestly dont know why quit lying to yourself it slaps fools need a lesson on good beer lmaooo
722,I.C. Light Mango,3.92,went down as smooth as butter very tasty as well yum could be a little sweeter tastes like flavoured water mango very fresh pretty ic look tastes fire it would have a better rating if they made shirts for it ill give you guys a 5 if you send me a shirt
723,I.C. Light Mango,3.55,poured from a clear 12 oz bottle has a pale straw color with a 12 inch head smell is of sweet mango taste is mango some grains sweet but not as much as the aroma would have suggested feels mediumlight bodied in the mouth and overall this is one of the better beers i have had both from this style and this brewery
724,I.C. Light Mango,3.04,a bland gold with half finger head that dissipates quickly  s pungent mango with minimal malt  f sweet mango with watered down feel  m watery and light and mango  o better than expected
725,I.C. Light Mango,2.23,pale gold color with zero head lots of clarity  aroma is of moldy broccoli stewed beets and mango puree  the initialbase flavor is really awful like used chewing tobacco but its entirely grainy then a nice mango flavor comes in  whether its artificial or real i guess it doesnt matter because it takes over the nasty flavor so its a welcome arrival the finish is of mangograpefruit lozenge a general rotten flavor sustains throughout the profile  feel is nonexistent just very thin empty clean though nice carbonation light chalkiness  overall much less impressive than the berry flavor i didnt like this one at all
726,I.C. Light Mango,3.12,pittsburgh brewing co ic light mango 12 fl oz clear glass bottle ink jet packaging information is worn and illegible 2  weis conshohocken pa  the label for pittsburgh brewing cos ic light mango is basically the recipe its ic light with natural flavors and artificial sweeteners added that sound a little bit harsh but it actually gives it pleasant and surprisingly realistic mango flavor the only surprise is that its also lightly skunked  and im assuming its only lightly skunked because there arent that many hops in there to begin with still it doesnt come across as sweet even with the additional sweeteners its an interesting and enjoyable light beer that would be perfect for summer and at just 38 abv you could drink a few if you wanted to a very good entry into the fruited light beer category
727,I.C. Light Mango,3.29,my senior manager brought a 4pck from pa it was 95f with high humidity today with real feel being 103fthis tasted awesome it poured a golden clear with initial white head that eventually dissapated leaving no lace the scent was mango the taste was light beer with mango flavoringbordering a shandy the mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation overall its decent and great on warmer days
728,Stargazer,3.68,poured into a wide mouth grip shaped goblet color is straw gold murky haziness head presents 1 finger thick head then dissipates to thin top and ring on glass sides  smell is mixed tropicals citrus typical nt offering light maltiness with bread and wheat notes  taste is sweet light candied notes tropical fruit with pineapple forward some citrus some berry light maltiness and notes of breadbiscuit a little thickersweeter than broken heels  mouthfeel is low carbonation moderatestrong sweetness low bitterness lingering sweetbitterness  overall a sweeter slightly cloying broken heels
729,Stargazer,4.13,one fingers worth of crisp bone white colored froth respectable retention color is a hazed lemony yellow light pineapple and hay on the nose perhaps a bit of orange zest as well palate is largely as expected but notes of stone fruit add a lot of great depth and complexity on the fuller side of medium bodied and ultra lush with just the slightest bit of carbonation goes down smoothly sip after sip very nice textbook beer from new trail that is sulquarely in their wheelhouse good stuff
730,Stargazer,3.99,undated can into pint glass pours a murky medium gold with a brief offwhite head minimal lacing initial impression is pineapple mango and tropical fruits mouthfeel is smooth and medium thick finish fades to citrus overall an ok but not notable neipa
731,Indian Brown Ale,4.08,innovative hybrid style part robust porter part ipa all brown ale deep chocolate brown with a frothy pale tan head of sticky foam aroma is brown sugar and leather chocolate malted milk and whiff of phenolic esters flavor is robust for a brown ale and firmly bittered but not ipa ibus full of dark and caramel grain character medium plus body with great balance of sweet and herb bite though a little bit cloying as it warms this reminds me of ubu ale and turbo dog but bigger and better  with a hint of kick ass brown hopiness like most dfh beers unique offstyle and memorable
732,Indian Brown Ale,4,first time i had ever seen this stylereally good no joke i could taste a stout an ipa not a lot but some distinctive hops and a good brown ale mostly the first and last but it wasnt entirely one if the aforementioned styles i really enjoyed it
733,Maudite,3.99,12oz bottle best by february 2nd 2026  on the pour 3 fingers of fluffy off white head formed on top of a dark reddish brown and hazy body over a couple minutes the head fades to a 05cm covering sporadic lacing forms  aroma is a bit hollow on the first impression there is a strange almost metallic or mineralic earthiness before a sweet caramel malt comes though and some nice belgian yeast spiciness there is a bit of a funk  flavor is very nice with a slight bitterness along with a bready pumpernickel maltiness the spicy yeast comes in strong with cloves vanilla and cinnamon not to mention the actual spices that were used during brewing then a nice fade into a mellow sweet and almost mulled malty finish that is slightly chocolate the bitterness fades fast  the feel on this beer is full but dry and surprisingly drinkable for the abv the 8 still makes itself known but in a friendly relaxing way super smooth and cozy it reminds me of the holidays  overall this was a nice surprise easy drinking and mellow for this style of beer full flavor and cozy comforting maltiness but no clear alcohol burn make this very nice as a beer after a long day at work
734,Maudite,3.58,12oz bottle poured into a goblet glass off white head falls to a light cap rich brown color with carbonation rising to the top smell is vinous at first then aromas of fresh baked brown bread taste is malty bready some caramel a bit of dark fruit taste is fairly light and fades away in the finish feel is light well carbonated overall this is good but flavors kind of fade too quickly
735,Maudite,4.25,12oz bottle dated best before 52425  pours dark copper with a chillhaze moderate retention and lacing clovestudded apples with a caramel drizzle in the nose medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel fairly malty on the palate with minimal bitterness and a earthy spicy profile finishes fairly dry with lingering spice
736,Maudite,4.27,pours a rich orangishbrown with a fluffy white head that just wont go away the first thing i smelled was bananas with a malty support there is also a spiciness which follows through in the taste the feel is medium and is refreshing overall a good dubbel i salute the damned 
737,Maudite,3.74,i like their tripel much better the delivery on this is very good but i dont like the aftertaste so much it has a great body though and it is still enjoyable to drink
738,Maudite,2.89,very thick head three fingers upon pour weak aroma of malt and spice upon taste immediate onslaught of heavy sparking spice and malt heavy carbonation flavor is an overripe banana with spicy burn and a smooth watery body not very enjoyable
739,Maudite,4.25,this belgian dubbel pours a deep and dusky orange color with a massive offwhite head and aromas of rich bread malts smooth caramel belgian yeast and spices it has a bready taste with flavors of bread malts smooth caramel belgian orange spices and yeast it finishes dry and yeasty with some smooth caramel and bready undertones mediumbodied with strong carbonation and yeasty on the palate it has a wonderful balance of wheat belgian spices and orange citrus with some caramel sweetness overall an excellent example of the style
740,Maudite,4.4,draught
741,Triple Shot,4.65,look  black thick but not syrup great tan head rimming lacing as good as it gets smell  roasted malts and coffee taste  coffee dark chocolate roasted malts feel  full body fizz lighter carb great mouth coat overall  best coffee stout i can remember
742,Triple Shot,4.43,canned 22022 im pleasantly surprised by how sweet this isnt just a hint of rich semisweet chocolate at finish the nutty roasty base makes for a wonderful coffee showcase throughout
743,Triple Shot,4.53,appearance  the beer poured a deep black color with an inch of tan head  smell  the beer smelled like fresh roasted coffee with roasted bean notes and chocolate in the profile  taste  overall this was like espresso with a huge body there were notes of fresh roasted coffee fudge chocolate ice cream and just a hint of vanilla the sweetness came out more in the finish in the big picture it was an assault of espresso  mouthfeel  the beer had a nice thick clingy body it allowed the bitterness to linger  overall  this was a really nice stout with a lot of coffee finding a more intense coffee stout would be a challenge
744,Triple Shot,4.38,nice dark black color with outstanding brown foam and lacing smell is nothing to write home aboutwater slight roasted malts and a faint sweet coffeebut it tastes fantastic deep coffee tones permeate throughout and a sweet molasses cover a base of toasty malt stout cheers
745,Stone IPA,4.16,this is my goto ipa it has a nice strong bitterness with a good warming resin and malty flavor there is a nice lemon note in taste and smell throughout i can take this in the can or pour in a glass main reason its my goto is it packs a nice punch for a nice price
746,Stone IPA,4.18,this classic american ipa starts with bready malt and a restrained note of stone fruit then finishes with decisive bitterness an ultra classic rarely improved upon for a more adventurous brew skas modus hoperandi takes this concept further into parts unknown for perfection bells two hearted ale leans in the direction of drinkability
747,Stone IPA,3.87,plenty of bitteracrid hops lovely piney complexity with the hops here this is not a beer that is going for balance primarily bitter of course its much better than your average beer  but its not my favorite ipa
748,Stone IPA,5,this is the best beer ever the quintessential socal ipa phenomenal perfect in every way
749,Stone IPA,4.39,look  golden clear solid white head lacing was minimal smell  piney citrus lemon peel taste  piney resinous citrus lemon peel feel  medium body moderate carbonation piney resin bitterness lingers overall  ive had this many times and its still a damn good beer if you love west coast ipas then youll love this one too pine resin citrus lemon peel and good bitterness that lingers this is the brew that put stone on the map and kept them there for good reason the bitterness was hitting so good tonight so i paired her up with stone cold crazy by queen
750,Stone IPA,4.59,look liquid gold smell strong piney resin and lemony zest taste pine resin lemon and bitters with very tame and subtle malt feel crispy and refreshing overall one of the most refreshing bitterhoppy and satisfying ipas on the easily accessible market
751,Stone IPA,4.13,solid ipa tame and restrained compared to most current hop offerings but remember this is like rating your middle school girlfriend while you have been kicking it at studio 54 for a few months everything is well done but tamped down which is understandable brown pine straw wheat bread and a little corn sweetness sul ross ms 1985 pour one out for raydog ohduhlay
752,Stone IPA,4.1,pours clear dark amber gold notes of citrus and hoppy goodness taste follows with a smooth feel nice fresh aftertaste not acrid at all really good
753,Stone IPA,4.22,poured from a 12 ounce can into a teku glass  look deep gold very hazy visible small particulate cream colored very frothy head above average head retention and lacing  smell clementine pine resin lemon zest between medium and high strength of scent  taste clementine pine resin pineapple lemon zest medium strength of flavor  feel medium body average carbonation high bitterness highly creamy mildly dry finish  overall deep gold and very hazy with above average head retention and lacing bouquet was clementine pine resin and lemon zest flavor was similar to the nose with some notes of pineapple the feel was medium body with high bitterness and creaminess overall this was a very nice example of a west coast ipa that provided a nice drinking experience
754,Stone IPA,3.42,mediocre
755,Stone IPA,4.05,chill haze orange gold body with a sticky white head nose is orange and grapefruit pith and zest some fresh pine needles and a hint of spice theres a bit of a sweet malt backbone to the beer that wasnt obvious to me in the nose it seems a bit more than i recall from having this over the years but the can has a date that puts it at a month old so its not that the citrus note melds into the malt weakening its pop compared to the nose pine comes through with a little more power to make up for that although it isnt as fresh  more like the pine needles have fallen to the forest floor still a solid ipa but it isnt as brash as i thought it once was
756,Nooner Pilsner,4.21,12 oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass look is clear light gold with a white head that falls to a thin cap lively in the glass as carbonation races up through the body a bit of lacing left as you sip smell is bold as bready malt earthy spicy hops and a bit of black pepper leap out taste is sweet bread up front then a bit of bitterness kicks in with the hop spiciness the finish has a bit of applepear rind and an almost flint like character the finish is fairly clean in the end mouthfeel is light bodied crisp very inviting carbonation cleans up the palate nicely overall this is a fan favorite for a good reason it can be as complicated of a beer as you want drink it fast without a thought sip and contemplate the different components either way it delivers
757,Nooner Pilsner,3.99,look  pale straw foamy white head smell  bready peppery light fruit taste  crackery black pepper fruity malt sweetness feel  light body well carbonated crisp dry finish overall  looks like an average pilsner but the scent sets the stage for whats to come very spicy peppery and a light fruitiness that first sip hits with cracker black pepper and bitterness  very good bitterness apple and malty sweetness come thru more as it warms but the peppery bitterness remains take this one down early and pair her up with afternoon delight by starland vocal band enjoy
758,Nooner Pilsner,3.72,nooner  sierra nevada brewing co pilsner german  sierra nevada has always made a decent pilz very traditional on point to style very crisp and clean these beers are looked at now as easygoing sit by a pool side and relax style but that would be over simplifying this style dig the simplicity

760,Nooner Pilsner,4.13,tastes like beer to me 12ounce bottle into a clear solo cup clear pale yellow white head good head retention not much lacing because solo cup bready and grassy with spicy and floral notes and a crisp finish that leaves lots of bitterness and a tart fruity note lingering on the palate great pairing with spicy mexican cuisine an outstanding and easydrinking beer
761,Nooner Pilsner,4.01,crystal clear gold dense finger of foam excellent retention thin rings of lace bright herbalspicyfloral hop nose over bready malt aroma honeyed bread with herbalspicy flavors dry mediumlight bodied could use a touch more carbonation really good pils
762,Nooner Pilsner,3.85,pours a brilliantly bright dark gold crystal clear white bubbly head settles quickly but it leaves a nice thin film there is some minor lacing  nose is quite hoppy get some bright citrus combine with some herbal qualities leads me to want to say lemongrass like malt is mostly cracker like with some light grain husk character  the taste is also nicely hoppy but too me it is not overdonesemisweet cracker like malt greets first tastes sort of like a mix of water cracker and ritz to me then come the hops very grassy hay like hops after the sip goes down the herbal nature hits in the aftertaste  bigger side of light bodied hops are tongue coating and then the bitterness hits moderately on the finish this beer doesnt not finish the driest or crispiest but it still finishes quite clean for me the drying sort of builds but its still has this minor lingering malt presence
763,Nooner Pilsner,4.04,from a 12oz bottle dated 41423 into a pint glass  pours a translucent straw color with a little more than one finger of white head excellent retention and lacing  big aromas of fresh cut grass flowers and black pepper  taste follows spicypeppery grass sharp tasting bitter  mediumbodied for a pils dry finish medium carbonation bitter aftertaste  solid beer would love to sidebyside this with summerfest

765,Flora Plum,4.52,solid beer  a bit plum tart aftertaste
766,Flora Plum,4.76,original bottling  it is a clear reddish plum pour with half a finger of pure white head it looks less thick than many of the hf saisons i have tried but prettier  tart plum bursts from the bottle and fills the room as i pour it gets even stronger my salivary glands fire before i even put nose to glass such a delicious aroma it calls entices with fresh plum tart sourdough raspberry jam grape must notes honeysuckle hints of spicy alcohol and fresh flowers in perfect balance to create a stunning aroma  all the flavors of the nose are here no need to repeat them balanced perfectly in a wonderful blend it ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a tart fruity linger as it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix quite lightly and it gets even better  medium body for style light carbonation which works well here clean as a whistle with a brilliantly flavored linger that is just right to bring on desire for next sip  another masterpiece from the master i regret not tasting fresh it has either remained or become a beauty of a beer that is an artistic work of intoxicating refreshment
767,Flora Plum,4.74,after flora pear this is my favorite flora excellent barrel character has been imparted into the beer pours a beautiful deep gold big wine nose effervescent with plums dancing in the background fantastic

769,Festina P√™che,3.9,why doesnt dfh sell this in bottlescans one of their better offerings
770,Festina P√™che,3.83,it is pretty cool to see tiny peach chunks floating around the smell is not as good as it could be its a subtle peach smell slightly overpowered by the sour the taste of this beer is excellent though if you love peach with a sour afternoon this is the beer for you this beer is so refreshing on a hot day and so crushable the low abv and flavor make this an excellent light choice for the summer
771,Festina P√™che,3.54,this beer pours a cloudy apricot color with a moderate white head there is a strong pleasant smell of pineapple the taste is bitter and tangy the most notable flavor is lemon but its overpowered by an artificial sweetener

773,Festina P√™che,3.65,12 ounce can poured into a willi becher  nice peach aroma peach flavor is good to but more subtle light and refreshing not too tart a touch watery
774,Festina P√™che,3.87,pours orange with a 1 inch white head moderate lacing hazy  aroma is dank peaches tangerine not much else  taste is sour wheat tart peach tart apple mouth puckering  light bodied light carbonation dry tart finish  a nice tart beer thirst quenching
775,Festina P√™che,3.66,12oz can from the variety pack about 2 months old  unfiltered no foam at first but a big head that sticks around after an aggressive pour looks like apple cider otherwise not too sweet not too sour tart light not much to speak of grain and sour peaches smells like a corona with too much lime  the neoberliner weiss tag is bizarre  ill call it sour light

777,Blackout Stout,4.05,appearance pours a completely dark black color with a strong tan head srm of 24 400  aroma strong aromas of dark chocolate rich chocolate coffee cream and roast rich and chocolate 400  flavor strong flavors of rich chocolate some cany sugar gives a sweet belgian chocolate and tongue tickle in the middle before a rich and smooth chocolate finish malty and sweet but then an uprising roasted bitterness ends up lingering 400  feel heavierbodied average to stronger carbonation sweet but then also an uprising of roasted bitterness that lingers 400  compared to bells expedition stout 22023 pours similar lighter head similar aromas more bittersweet chocolate and coffee roast less thick and heavy chocolate with complex malt flavors of bread pudding and caramel more bitter roasted and dry  overall a fantastic russian imperial stout as usual great lakes fashion this one packs together a great array of rich chocolate flavors with a rising roasted bitterness balance is the name of the game here and it does it very nicely 99 makes it feel like its lighter but make no mistake its still 10 and incredibly and dangerously drinkable rating 405
778,Blackout Stout,4.3,12 ounce bottle in a fine snifter  toasted dark brown color with a nice 1f dark tan cap semitransparent various light lacing  dry barley out front dark chocolate and roasted coffee aromas anise and liquor soaked dark fruit  belgian dark chocolate and roasted coffee flavors the dry barley comes along  palate friendly smooth medium body dark roast and a touch of hop bitterness blend together  a good xmas eve stout pick that ends the evening nicely all around good imperial stout that ill have again
779,Blackout Stout,4.02,12 oz bottle date 06112019 consumed on 17 nov 2022 glass snifter abv 99 serving temp 548 f   look deep and opaque black with a thin tan head the head dissipates to a ring and a thin film over most of the beer lacing is good  smell very rich dark bittersweet chocolate with some notes of dark fruits in the background some char which blends into the chocolate aromas and faint notes of espresso and black licorice some earthy notes are in there as well  taste dark malts and chocolate start things off and then the dark fruits and some molasses like blackstrap take over for a short time the sip really sweetens up with perhaps some brown sugar coming thru then the earthy notes and the somewhat bitter char take over which help bring back some chocolate and also some dark roasted coffee things finish bittersweet and roasty and somewhat dry for an imperial stout the alcohol is fairly well hidden though not completely  feel smooth and creamy with some warmth from the alcohol the body is medium with a slight lean towards mediumfull  overall a very good russian imperial stout not overly bitter for the style this tends towards the sweeter side but not overly much very drinkable and perhaps dangerously so  this beer has aged well over the 4 years that i have had it i think that things have smoothed out over that time and blended quite nicely what does seem to have suffered is the headcarbonation and the body which is a tad light for my preferences for an ris but thats ok i never found this beer to be overly hoppybitter when fresh so i wasnt sure how it would handle this many years i can say that it handled that time just fine
780,Blackout Stout,4.18,pours a black color with a minimal head that disappears quickly aroma of coffee and roasted malts taste is black coffee and roasted malts finish is hoppy bitterness
781,Blackout Stout,1.79,horrible stout smells contain malt and barley very little coffee or chocolate unless the bitterness is supposed to be the coffee and chocolate very unbalanced in terms of sweetness extremely bitter much better stout beers out there
782,Blackout Stout,4.5,nicely balanced classic ris not as bitter and hop heavy as some others made during the past decades very much enjoyed and found this easy to drink
783,Blackout Stout,4.12,pours a transparent dark brown small khali head hangs around for a bit leaving some spotty lacing nose gets lotsa roasted malt taste buds say dark fruit bitter cocoa and a slightly hoppy finish look forward to this every year surprised ive never rated it before
784,Blackout Stout,4.68,12oz bottle into a pint glass  pours a nice dark color near black with a creamy tan head that reduced to about half a finger for the duration of the drink  smells of cherries with the faintest hint of chocolate  tastes of cherries with a dark chocolate and coffee finish absolutely amazing alcohol very well hidden  mouthfeel is crisp yet very smooth almost creamy but also almost thin  a nice balanced inbetween incredibly enjoyable  overall a great imperial stout that 99 makes this a oneanddone at most at a time in my book but it is worth it definitely my favorite seasonal from glbc
785,Go To IPA,3.75,after trying a lot of session ipas i basically ended up avoiding the style save for founders allday well this bottle of beer which i consumed on the porch during the pandemic reminds me a lot of allday it has a soft hop bitterness many sessions are almost overly hopped and quite thin without the malt backbone
786,Go To IPA,3.74,330ml can l hazy marmalade colour with a long lasting head and sheets of lacing s incredible rich earthy aroma like freshly turned soil t wood and resin f bitter and astringent as its supposed to be o a fullon west coast ipa at only 47 its technically very accomplished but the mouthfeel still suffers and im not convinced that a beer this bitter will ever be truly sessionable regardless of its abv
787,Go To IPA,3.88,330 ml can brewed in berlin abv is 47 bought at gulating √∏lutsalg stavanger hazy golden colour small white head aroma of citrus and tropical fruits a hint of dill hoppy and citrussy flavour slightly sweet also notes of tropical fruits and pine needles bitter finish good beer
788,Go To IPA,3.96,clear gold great white head awesome retention and lace pine orange zest and light dank light orange and pine a little bit of sweet malt but kinda thin tasting light bodied and good carbonation i feel that this would be a good beer for outside around the grill in the summer not just getting in from walking the dog in the winter id probably like it better then tried my best to be objective
789,Go To IPA,4.03,12oz bottle tulip bottled on 102220  light gold yellow big fluffy head with great retention  nectarine lemon tangerine impressively aromatic with lots of delicate fruit  two row gritty bitterness thats really great for a session ipa and lots of fruitiness lychee tangerine white grape stone fruit  light body dry finish impressive bitterness  in the running for best session ipa ive had hop aroma and flavor are all there including significant bitterness and great drying bitter finish not usually seen in the substyle
790,Go To IPA,3.73,a pours crystal clear golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a light layer and leaves a little nice lacing  s zesty citrus mostly lemon and grapefruit grassy resinous pine and crackery malt  t citrus zest grapefruit and lemona little tangerine and lime grassy resinous pine subtle fruity notes passion fruit peach apricot and mango crackery malt pretty much bone dry finish  m light body moderately lively carbonation  o havent had this one since it was first released before i was on ba so its nice to get to try it again takes me back to when session ipas were the new toy on the shelf to its credit this one is bright and crisp and would definitely do the job as a lawnmower beer that said it does have a bit of the trademark session ipa wateryness and there are other session ipas out there with a bit more balance and flavor wouldnt turn it down but wouldnt be my go to
791,Go To IPA,3.93,appearance lightly hazy bright golden hue slim white head  aroma as advertised very vibrant and utterly bursting with hops bold and bright citrus and pine ah so nice  taste more of that big fierce and shining hop flavor with just enough juicy malt below lean bodied with a dominant buzz of hop bitterness drinkable yes also refreshing and tasty too its good beer and i can drink it butjust doesnt thrill me i really dont desire the session ipa i like the regular ones just fine thank you very much faced with the choice of this or a regular stone ipa i know where im going  this one is merely okay and thats not what i expect out of stone low on my priorities
792,Go To IPA,4,poured into a tall clear pint glass clear bright golden color with a finger or so of creamy white head good retention and lacing  getting a lot of citrus notes in the aroma orange lemon and lime zest along with the fruits themselves some biscuity malt mango and a strong smell of pineapple  tasting primarily the citrus zest and rinds too nicely bitter hops some pine and resin added in the flavor along with the biscuity malt cant say that this beer tastes sweet however body is medium light

795,Kriek Ale,4.32,2021 version has been refridgerated since new 78 just a totally beautiful beer from the deep garnet red colour to the amazing funkysour nose to the lovely flavor profile sour but so under control great carbonation and great dying mouth feel i think age has done this one wonders
796,Kriek Ale,4.3,2021
797,Kriek Ale,4.59,divine
798,Kriek Ale,3.9,april 2017 750 ml corked  caged bottle as cascade kriek northwest sour ale ale aged in oak barrels with cherries 2015 project abv is 71 at cardinal pub  bar stavanger brownish red colour moderate to small offwhite head with a peachy hue aroma of sour cherries lactic acid oak and farmhouse medium sour flavour distinct notes of sour cherries lactic acid and oak
799,Kriek Ale,4.5,2013 drinking amazing
800,Kriek Ale,4.14,a 750ml corked and caged bottle 2015 project poured into a 3 fonteinen stemmed glass  appearance a lightly hazy deep amber red colour with a one finger beige head that dissipated quickly but settled to a thin layer while leaving some nice lacing  aroma tart cherries oak maybe some mixed berries  taste sour tart cherries oak and a hint of spices  mouthfeel medium bodied with moderate carbonation  overall nice cherry flavours slightly acidic but not overly so
801,Kriek Ale,4.28,2017 from the bottle  a deep dried blood red with auburn and chestnut highlights bordering the clean body towards the browner side of the spectrum it would be still looking if it werent for the few rising bubbles hopelessly devoted to supporting some kind of cap above but a failed attempt nonetheless  sweet and sour cherries clearly and proudly display themselves front and center with a mouthwatering acidity deep red wine oak barrel and all shine from withing a touch of pepper and damp mulch linger in the end  wow this thing tastes like straight sour grape and cherry fun dip i think the puckering powdery tartness not only exemplifies the feel but must be considered a flavor to this beast as well as it warms oak certainly comes through along with a boysenberry sweetness  feel see above add some strong tannins an initial slickness a wood stripping acidic drying tartnessand almost no carbonation and viola there you have it  this is a sour to compete with the most of sours delicious well executed but so friggin intense like most of the offerings ive had the pleasure of enjoying certainly not for the faint of heart  cheers
802,Juicy,4.41,l  surprisingly amberbrown body with two fingers of white head produced with moderate pour some retention and good lacing s  definitely dry hopped some nice tropical notes along with a somewhat unpleasant medicinal note almost like pepto bismol also getting oak mixed berry and subtle barnyard funk i like it more as it warms t  the name is pretty spot on here this is surprisingly candylike not overly tart but there is some distinct lemon peel character great balance between hoppy and funky f  crisp effervescent eminently drinkable o  definitely my favorite of the dryhopped hf saisons  89100
803,Juicy,4.47,bottled on february 14 2020 pours a vibrant golden color with a finger of medium density white head that receded to a thin ring aroma is excellent a combination of wine barrels orange lemon and miscellaneous tropical fruits burst from the glass maybe a little bit of tart funk but it definitely takes a back seat  on the tongue the funk is much more present the taste leads with wine barrel  oak funk mid palate i get some tropical notes along with wildflowers i dont believe any dandelions are in this beer but to me it tastes like they are on the very long finish the funk has more of an earthy feel surprisingly full body well carbonated and smooth despite a bit of acidity  overall this is an excellent beer complex and layered in a way i dont often see the barrels really add to the experience an excellent example of what happens when skill and patience combine
804,The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.56,2023 draft at churchkey didnt really meld together for me not much other than sweetness
805,The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.9,173 fantastic
806,The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.57,750ml waxed and capped bottle into a bbt snifter  pours pitch black rich and dense huge dark mocha colored legs no head no lace nose is mocha chocolate hazelnut and slight overtones of barrel just as advertised and amazingly rich beer opens rich milk chocolate hazelnut and mocha coffee layers of molasses vanilla and lactose in the middle more chocolate hazelnut and pancake syrup in the back the barrel character has mellowed out significantly at this point but the adjunct flavors are still bright as day somehow not overly sweet given the flavor combination long lingering finish and aftertaste body is spot on rich thick and chewy coats the palate long lingering boozy aftertaste  this beer is impressive really nice balance in the flavor i dont know that i want too much barrel so as to not drown out the other flavors here definitely worth trying
807,The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.46,batch 1 retro review big hazelnut and coffee minimal coconut and barrel nice and sweet altogether it worked very very well
808,The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.85,the coffee melds wonderfully with chocolate vanilla and bourbon stupid thicc mouthfeel with a chewy booziness that lingers
809,Hold On To Sunshine,4.42,super tasty very dark desert beer very thick and a bit overpowering so one will do it
810,Hold On To Sunshine,4,can from jeff thanks for the hookup inky black with a huge frothy creamy light tan head that slowly recedes rich milk chocolate and creamed coffee with bits of licorice and dark fruits pretty nice
811,Hold On To Sunshine,4.56,poured from 16oz can into pint glass in february 2023 that i purchased at their brewery in charlton ma there is a date of winter 2023 on the bottom of the can and i drank this about 1 month after i purchased it  appearance very dark black with 1finger head the head was dark brown and disappeared after a minute it left only a little lacing on the glass and no head remained after a minute  smell strong mix of aromas filled the room as soon as the can was opened roasted coffee caramel and chocolate aromas not much hop style citrus or pine aromas  taste there is taste of coffee chocolate and licorice also some vanilla peanut butter and roasted malt flavors they are more balanced than i expected from the aroma flavors are very bold there is a strong alcohol presence that matches 76 advertised a sweet chocolate and vanilla aftertaste with edge of coffee that is really enjoyable  mouthfeel very thick but with an extremely smooth and creamy body  this is a very good porter and one of the best porters i have ever drank it has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer the balance of flavors is outstanding the flavors of coffee and roasted malt nicely balance the bitter coffee with the sweet chocolate and caramel flavors this is even better than the tree house cartharsis porter which is very good this is very smooth and enjoyable to drink i have enjoyed all the beers ive bought at tree house and i would buy this again
812,Hold On To Sunshine,4.08,dark brown with a half finger of audibly fizzy dark khaki head that quickly settles into a lasting crown no real lacing  roast peanuts peanut butter roasted malt and quality breakfast blend coffee in the aroma  the taste spotlights peanut butter very light chocolate and caramel and some roastiness from the complementary coffee  creamy full bodied feel with a mouthcoating oiliness and light zip to the carbonation  peanut beers arent my thing but this is a very nicely made one
813,Hold On To Sunshine,4.19,16 oz can no date on the bottom  pours an opaque inky black color thick tan colored head big chocolate peanut butter aroma similar taste like a reeses peanut butter cup not really any coffee detected fairly sweet definitely a dessert beer full bodied slick mouthfeel
814,Hold On To Sunshine,4.56,16 oz can poured into a pint glass pours black with a nice head nice peanut butter backbone running through this to compliment the overrriding chocolate flavor reminds me of an imperfect peanut better cup very enjoyable stout
815,Hold On To Sunshine,4.59,6 months old can to tumbler  look pours pitch black with a full but patchy dark brown head that dissipates quickly a lot of very fine floaters visible  smell peanut butter and milk chocolate combined with some roasty hints almonds and tobacco appear as the beer warms  taste peanuts chocolate and coffee slightly sweet somehow roasty and minimally bitter  feel creamy and oily with a clearly present carbonation quite smooth  overall no barrelaging no double digit abv but still a fantastic stout with a classic flavor combination all flavors are incorporated very nicely resulting in a great balance and a smooth drinkability there are plenty of chocolaty peanut butter stouts out there but this is clearly the best one ive had so far
816,Hopslam Ale,4.4,i always grab a few six packs of this legend when it comes out every january ish seems much easier to find the past few years but absolutely a must try beer ive always loved the faint taste and mouthfeel of honey hidden behind the massive hops and malt one of the best beers ive ever had
817,Hopslam Ale,4.48,excellent dipa one of the best only drawback is that it has a pretty strong alcoholic aroma and taste which people may not prefer really good but just not quite in the same level as a heady topper or pliny the elder
818,Hopslam Ale,5,this is the best imperial ipa 4455 is too low firstly the smell and taste is exactly what a west coast imperial ipa should taste like the hops are complex and massive but balanced with the malt and the sweetness the overall taste is not like a 10 abv beer but tastes more like something that is 8 i would really like to compare it to both heady topper and pliny the elder but this is the best beer that bells brewery makes
819,Hopslam Ale,4.2,was expecting a little better with such a high rating overall it is definitely better than most would probably buy again
820,Hopslam Ale,3.48,heres a hot take i dont think this is a good beer perhaps i got a bad batch last time but it just didnt have the flavor profile id expect from a beer that almost cracks the top 250 the honey seemed to reduce the supposed hopslam down to more of a hop nudge this meant any flavor complexity seemed to disappear as well in this case i think the high abv is also detrimental as it tastes very alcoholic and therefore heavy too bad cause its a heck of a value at costco
821,Hopslam Ale,4.28,in a flight at british open pub oh my goodness complex and over the top in all the tight ways a strong hops palate but also a strong malt backbone kinda boozy but its new years eve
822,Hopslam Ale,4.55,poured from 12oz can to a tulip glass look is fairly clear burnt orangeamber color with a foamy ivory head that takes a while to fall to a nice cap sits pretty still in the glass smell is pine melon caramel apple aroma is present but not powerful taste is pretty sweet up front with a hit of cantaloupe and citrus middle gets a shot of bitterness but nothing too bracing middle sees more fruit flavor like apple and citrus a bit of pine hits in the finish but its balanced by a floral honey sweetness balance is a key characteristic here aftertaste is apples caramel and honey feel is medium bodied and smooth smooth smooth a low carbonation pops up but boy this is easy to drink overall i should have tried this years ago but balked at the price this is tasty balanced pretty well between hop bitterness and malt sweetness way too easy to drink given the 10 abv i am a fan of this one though
823,Hopslam Ale,4.66,still one of the best dipas on the planet even in 2022 with all the competition what makes this beer for me is the mouthfeel its thick and chewy without being syrupy wish this was around all year
824,Exponential Hoppiness,4.4,from a monthold pint can pours a very clear darkishgold small white head with little lacing as youd expect from this abv smell and taste are classic west coast ipa with pine and honey malt in balance good hit of bitterness in the finish no trace of alcohol medium feel great beer
825,Exponential Hoppiness,4.37,notes from 12202019  on tap in a half pint snifter at the draft house austin texas look is golden and a little cloudy there is almost no head because the staff pour carefully to the brim to give you more beer 425 smell is hops citrus stone fruit and a little spice 400 taste is mango citrus alcohol some malt pine and moderate bitterness 45 feel is medium and a little slick 45 overall it is a big ipa with a lot going on its too much for me to drink it offten but it is a great beer 45
826,Lagunitas Sucks,3.78,no lagunitas really sucks
827,Lagunitas Sucks,4.46,some scrappy notes from 2018 6 pack of 12 ounce bottles this beer pours a deep gold color and is crisp and bright tasting it is sweet and slightly resinous and is extremely easy drinking for its 8 abv i hope they continue to make it as it is one of my favorites from this brewery excellent
828,Lagunitas Sucks,3.42,355 ml bottle at a breakfast joint in petaluma deep golden to orange colour large offwhite head aroma and flavour of citrus pine caramel and sweet malts maybe a bit too far out on the sweet side for me but still a fairly nice beer some alcohol in the finish anyway i wouldnt say that it sucks
829,Lagunitas Sucks,4.18,the name sounds like its referring to the brewery with a bit of selfdeprecation but its really about 2020 but this beer is the opposite of 2020 its a dryhopped dipa with an abundance of complex flavors stemming from the multitude of grains used in its brewing lagunitas really hit the right combination for a dryhopped brew it is a nice crisp bitterness checks all the boxes of a solid dipa with big flavor
830,Lagunitas Sucks,3.39,pours a gold color with a creamy white head a little chill haze it has a medicine taste maybe because of the abv its very hop forward but not my pint of beer i like the regular ipa better it does taste a little like the year 2020 so theres that
831,Schmidt,2.9,does anyone remember schmidt city club that was a decent quaff
832,Schmidt,2.52,this was a beer that i remember from my service days when i was stationed in texas and oklahoma got it from a friend along with many other brands that he picked up for me along the way when he drove up to visit beer tasted like i remembered it not something to get excited about but it will quench a thirst when you need it
833,Schmidt,2.74,this rant review is in honor of 1980 nl mvp mike schmidt how did i see this beer in a variety of locations over the last 10 years but now on a day when i visit the damn neighborhood where the brewery used to stand i cant find a single can they gave the bar at the fire a new snazzy coat of paint but no longer do i see schmidt breweriana on the walls or cans in the their fridge none of the other joints in the vicinity had it shame on you garage with all your canned dreams to not include a row for dear old schmidt i will find you soon i know i will and ill do a proper review even though i already know what you probably taste like the above number ratings are based on schmidts 1979 stats im sure his namesake beer smells of an 8 but i cant bring myself to give an overall 1 dont mind me just delirious playing with digits 1980
834,Schmidt,2.88,pours a crystalclear straw yellow with a thin short lived white cap aroma is corn and biscuity flavor follows the nose when ice cold its a very modest priced refresher after drinking higher quality beers i mean to say that theres nothing wrong with saving a few bucks after the taste buds are as buzzed as the rest of you feel is crisp and well carbonated overall not a beer to write home about but now that im retired a cheap beer now and then works for me
835,Schmidt,3,i remember it being a decent beer for the money on a hot summer day the 12packs had the various sportsmen outdoors fishing and hunting motifs on the cardboard and the cans it was an okay beer for the budgetminded cheap about 4 bucks a 12pack back in the 80s definitely a light beer ice cold its crisp and unassuming with not much of an aftertaste
836,Schmidt,4.32,decent basic lager crisp clean refreshing and tastes good biscuity nicely blended hops medium to light body dry finish not sweet
837,Schmidt,3.09,a middleoftheroad adjunct lager poured from 12ounce can into a vintage hollowstemmed goblet mainly for looks a center pour yielded a nice twofinger white head atop a clear paleyellow body decent retention some nice lacing and good carbonation thats about it aromas and flavors of corn grassy hops and tart cider light in body not much bitterness a little bit of fruity tartness lingers on the finish overall not much here to offend the taste buds and the olfactory senses
838,Schmidt,4.84,when i was farming i grew cereal grains soybeans corn sunflowers and more schmidt doesnt taste or smell like corn when youre combining storing augering or hauling barley you know what it smells like how many of you have been in the dust it itches like heck as a trucker i hauled malted barley from moorhead  shakopee mn to anhesuserbusch in baldwinsville ny houston tx  strohs brewery in nj years ago i toured red hook in woodinville wa too ugh the coffee one was well like coffee ive hauled pearled feed and needles barley i know breweries and i know barley i drink schmidt because it has an aftertaste i drink it because it isnt a waterflavored beer i slayed the big mouth bottles back in the day ive sent emails to pabst about bringing the big schmidty back but to no avail in my ratings i dont believe in rating the look or the feel what for how many of you rate the beer based upon the 2 row or 6 row barley varieties is it good in a can yes is it good it a bottle absolutely how would i change it id add just a little more hops flavor love you all but i love schmidt more
839,Schmidt,2.68,from a 12oz can 499 for a 6 pack  appearance clear yellow ok head  smell mild corn  taste mix of mild sweet corn and a slight sourness it would be fine but then gives a butyric twinge  overall continuing a minitour of subpremium lagers schmidt used to be made in st paul and some signs can still be seen outside dive bars advertising it my can had a bear on it beer wasnt bad but wasnt too good either with a weird sour note to it
840,Schmidt,4.11,drank from a 12 ounce can scores are based on the style  look  the can is a vibrant red with a deer on it its a very honest and masculine can the schmidt logo would look good as a sticker in the back window of a pickup  smell  light and corny simple and airy a classic smell  taste  crisp and refined not too sweet not too earthy a really nice balanced flavor better than a lot of bigger name aals  feel  thin and still could use a bit more pep in its step though  overall  i had never heard of or seen this beer before just bought a case on a whim its way better than i expected its a simple casual drinker i could go through a lot of this
841,Schmidt,1.24,id rather drink keystone light
842,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.63,i love this beer 
843,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.21,pours out of the bottle a deep brown color with a finger of head and mild retention smells like cocoa roasted malts and coffee tastes slightly bitter to begin but then gets taken by the dry chocolate flavor nice inoffensive carbonation that provides a nice robust mouthfeel really nice
844,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.76,one of the best beers i have ever had such a great look the feel is so smooth and easy to drink the taste is bitter like black coffee but makes sure you feel great drinking it it is a very good beer
845,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.53,pours from a bottle into a guinness glass dark brownblack like cocacola tan head maybe an inch dissolves but doesnt disappear like a relationship that goes on after the thrill is gone  i cant smell much bad air in the 513 floraly with some alcohol smell  tastes good dark bitter like dark and burnt and broodingly regretful like the remnants of my broken heart or real black darkdarkroast coffee has an aftertaste like coke only without the acid as it warms up just some hints of caramelysweet in the aftertaste that arent there in front the sweet stays on my lips if she only says my broken heart  feels lighter than it looks a little carbonated drinks fast and easy i was done with it before i wanted to be tell me about it says my broken heart  overall a very very good beer very good like my own personal standard for what a dark beer not called guinness can be
846,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.26,color almost black with a thick and creamy head smell dark chocolate and coffee are predominant with some malt and toffee sweetness underneath taste bitter coco and coffee malt and a tiny bit of sweet peeking through feel holds up well with good texture and mouthfeel highly drinkable would recommend
847,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.79,excellent beer very dark i love it recommend trying it i found this at earth fare got a six pack for 699 has lots of head to it definitely can taste the malt and hops in it much better than any of those light beers ive had
848,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.5,pours a clear blackbrown with glints of red on top is a foamy tan head with good lacing notes of caramel brown sugar chocolate coffee and herbal hops round out the nose the flavor is smooth and rich for a brew that is surprisingly light on the palate hop flavor and bitterness is subdued and the malt really shines with warm caramel and chocolate flavors medium bodied with a crisp finish overall i guess i am a little taken aback as i always thought this was more of a big robust porter from hearing about it in reality it is a much more quaffable sessionable take on the style than i always thought much like great lakes lagers the level and complexity of the beers malt flavor is much more than one would typically find this is a very refined drinkable and delicious dark beer definitely deserving of being compared to deschutes black butte sierra nevada porter and other classics
849,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.79,i have a tough time finding this beer in missouri but i think one of the best porters i have ever tried
850,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.23,updated with review in march 2023  format and age 12oz bottle gifted best by april 22 2023  cold chain somewhat unknown transported cold after receiving it and kept in fridge at home  impressions pours very dark brown with red edges and a onefinger tan head aromas of chocolate and roast coffee dominate the taste starts with a big kick of bitter chocolate that sweetens as it lingers in the mouth progresses to notes of dark roast coffee and burnt toast with some dark fruit on the finish and aftertaste as it warms the dark fruits come out more while the bitter and burnt characteristics recede a bit medium bodied with moderate carbonation resulting in a smooth feel  overall a great porter great lakes did a good job keeping the bitterness in check while retaining that quintessential porter profile and making it more thab just a roast bomb definitely my favorite since having everett quite a few years ago now
851,Amstel Light,3,12oz bottle nest by november 2023  on a hard pour 2 fingers of bubbly white head formed on top of a clear golden body some lacing is left  aroma is immediately skunks in a weedy sort of way not super off perhaps it intentional some crackery malt in the back  taste is very thin with a slight crackery malt as well as that skunks bitterness not terrible for being light slightly funky right at the front does taste like lager beer  feel is thin and watery with a slight dryness this feels like almost nothing if it werent for a dryness that l is present refreshing at least  overall its a heineken adjacent light lager meh but not bad
852,Amstel Light,4.2,i dont know why the ipa beer snobs are killing this beer i personally prefer an ipa over a lager any day however if you want a light lager you cant go wrong with amstel light very refreshing beer whenever i bring amstel light to a party people respond by saying that they have not had an amstel in a while however for some reason they are the first to go great summer beer when you want to have a few
853,Amstel Light,4.17,if you are drinking light beer it is the best that i like hard pass on the other major brands light beers
854,Amstel Light,5,the best light pilsner you can buy
855,Amstel Light,3.64,pours a pale straw color with a quick receding white head smell is basically earthy grains taste is light maltiness with a nice crisp hop bite feel is crisp and refreshing light bodied finishes semi dry overall for a light beer this is not bad at all it is thin and lacking flavorbut we are talking about basically a 32 beer for what it is the ratings do not reflect the quality high abv stouts even crappy ones get above a 4 if the abv is above an eight i am judging this for what it is a weak32 beer
856,Amstel Light,3.24,l  poured from a 12 oz bottle into a sam adams perfect glass one and a half fingers of light off white head on an aggressive pour fades to a lightly foamy film lacing shows on agitation but quickly returns to liquid lots of carbonation showing from the nucleation in the glass that is easy to see through the clear light straw color  s  honey and crackers up front and thats really it  t  sweet honey and bready cracker taste follows scent maybe even some hints of cornbread very very minor crispness in the middle but really muted and fades fast the sweetness of the flavor is pleasant and not skunky at all like some other reviewers have experienced no real bitterness to speak of  f  thin mouthfeel like other light beers but not total water a nice amount of minor carbonation very easy to drink  o  overall this is one of the better mass produced light beers ive tried it actually has a palatable and pleasant if not straightforward flavor profile at this time im not normally reaching for light beers but if i had to choose a light beer this would be the choice for now perfectly refreshing for outdoors and camping recommended for those seeking a mass produced light beer other than the big three american labels
857,Amstel Light,1,drainpour
858,West Coast IPA,4.29,12 oz can enjoy by date 102423 into a pint glass l pours deep amber honey color with a 34 crusty frothy off white head that has vg retention very light carbo some sticky lacing s caramel malts berries citrus pineapple mango fairly floral t caramelized malts citrus ripe orange grapefruit berries melon black tea leaves honey a hint of bread has a slightly resinous finish that retains a bit of sweetness f soft smooth medbody with a slick  glassy middle and a mellow medlong finish that is lightly drying o a lovely tasting beer with excellent balance it has a light touch of honey throughout and has a very light resinous quality incredibly easy drinking for its abv it is outstanding in its style
859,West Coast IPA,4.27,pours golden yellow with white foamy cap and light notes of pine and back notes of citrus grapefruit and floral really nice classic ipa
860,West Coast IPA,4.17,look rubyred and nearly clear with a bountiful offwhite head that settles to a lid leaving good lacing behind aroma grapefruit  both white and rubyred pine sap and needles a little cannabis wafts of berries and some sweet onion taste pine hits hard up front and develops as citrus and some berry notes follow closely behind and weave in nicely fruity and lightly skunky cannabis notes appear as the pinecitrus subsides and onion stays in the background throughout closes with a bite along with more pine and grapefruit mouthfeel full lightly slick mediumhigh carbonation and moderate dryness on the finish overall this is delicious stuff this beer got me into simcoe hops 15 years ago and i used to drink it all the time until it ceased being bottled and distributed in the state glad to see it still gets tapped now and then and was a nice surprise birthday gift from my boss
861,West Coast IPA,3.93,from a can amber color with an inch of white foamy head earthy pine smell medium body with some stickiness earthy pine flavor with some grapefruit notes solid wcipa
862,West Coast IPA,4.02,only photos could describe the foamy white mess that rises above the top of a clear glass liter mug its that pathetic really no beer pour especially an ipa should ever have this much stark white starchy foam pretending to be a head this is the consequence of trying to fit two twelve ounce cans contents into the vessel with patience the foam recedes and there becomes almost a true beer head obviously there are concerns as big white foamy and starchy heads often lead to taste and mouthfeel disappointments the aroma is of ok piney hoppiness but so far its looks over aroma and looks have a big negative lead the color isnt the problem its a rich and bright dark amber thats close to being translucent actually its a pretty good looking brew once the head recedes much as expected this is a nicely west coast hopped rendition without much of a malt inclusion to carry it via its body nor to give it a counterbalance so necessary for a great ipa the ratings here may be inconsistent but that sums up the brew theres good color but bad lacing theres a nice sharp piney hop bite but no malt balance nor backbone this isnt bad and the tastes of those that want hoppiness even at the expense of a malty presence will like this to taste its a nicely dry hopped ale to anyone that loves a traditional ipa the lack of barley malt in the mix will spoil this
863,West Coast IPA,4.18,slightly hazy rich amber appearance with a generous fine bubbled head that left rings of good lacing big time piney resinous hop aroma some citrus with an initial hit of sweetness that fades after a few moments medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation the profuse amount of hops engage the palate from the start well into the lingering long lasting finish
864,West Coast IPA,4.3,from a 12oz can dated 121321 into a pint glass  pours a translucent brownish orange with about a half finger of with head gentle pour ok retention and lacing  smells of fresh cut grass and pint also got a hint of marijuana  piney resiny bitter taste 95 ibus in their gloryright in the wheelhouse for a wcipa some malts in there as wellbit of caramel  very sticky mouthfeelfull bodied strong bitter aftertaste medium carbonation  this is a wcipa hit the mark squarely and stinking enjoyable too
865,Chill Caribbean Beer,1.81,date july 30 2022 occasion preparing for the terrazo italiano dining experience with the first of three balashi products to sample pours a flat sallow golden body almost devoid of bubbles with a head that swiftly dissipates to a ring of offwhite headsquarely in line with beers that require limes dish detergent lemon some astringency something akin to the garden hose and cracker malts that dont really stir the interest much its palate refreshes swift with a slick malt base enough effervescence to register its real ingredients and a soft simple aftertaste that cleans rather than satisfies the flavor is as expecteda beer whose name is in terms of advertising a glittering generality is reduced to the temperature to which it is served slammable in its 74ounce bottles it doesnt move the needle for me though maybe if i were a twentysomething set loose in aruba this might be the morningafternoon beer that keeps me hydrated until the night arrives for now its pure novelty and a donation to balashiyou cant beat fresh homebrewed beer in that regard
866,Chill Caribbean Beer,4,had for lunch in 75 oz bottle and karminas kitchen in san nicholas aruba i liked it better than the balashi it had a sweeter and cleaner more refreshing taste pilsner is not my favorite but this was ok
867,Chill Caribbean Beer,2.79,this glorious golden beer reminds me much of a corona that being said you must drink this with a lime otherwise it is just not great however if youre on the beach or chilling poolside it is refreshing to sip on
868,Chill Caribbean Beer,3.39,my bestie brought a can of this to nashville whilst there for my sons hockey tournament it poured a clear yellow with white head that did not leave much lace the scent had faint grain notes the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with grain and lemon kisses the mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation overall its a good beer
869,Chill Caribbean Beer,3.45,poured into a pint glass via can  color is a light yellow  smell is a lagerslight malt crispness light citrus  tatse follows the nose  medium carbinationlight mouthfeel  arubas version of bud lightlike balashi its not a great beer but tastes better due to the location you are drinking it
870,Chill Caribbean Beer,2.61,its a good beach beer that i would recommend not drinking anywhere but aruba this is a pretty unique barleyricecorn flavor very sweet not much in the aroma feel is a little off
871,Molson Ice,3.75,molson ice is twice as nice like dangerfield compared to dice  update 823 poems are lame people who write the same
872,Molson Ice,3.2,remember grabbin these babies out of a 12 pack for my pops back in the 90s green bottle black and silver logo then more akin to a molson xxx of today having with lunch pours a decent lasting white head smell doesnt give much of anything untypical of the style taste is clean enough brewed in golden co for the states version im trying decent enough
873,Molson Ice,3.11,bottle pour into a tulip glass yellow golden appearance with a foamy white head grass malt metal medium to light body medium carbonation crisp finish
874,Molson Ice,2.85,an okay aal from north of the border
875,Molson Ice,3.81,good for a mass produced beer
876,Molson Ice,3,this is the perfect beer of hockey season you want a cold beer for fall after oktoberfest is over and you are short on cash but need to get blasted this is your canadian knight in shinning armor 57 abv and a 6 pack made by coors now so it has that rocky mountain golden colorado water flavor good malt and freeze method to make it smooth the drinkability of this beer is superb for college kids but the snobs after they get married and become hobbyists will turn their noses up to this i happen to like this beer and will give it a 35 this beer is not trying to be best in show this beer is trying to be that college buddy that wants your hockey team to win tell a funny joke and check in on you when you are in need
877,Molson Ice,3.77,quite a nice aal bought a double deuce for beer butt chicken poured about 6 oz into a can for cooking and the rest into a wheat ale glass clear golden and with a fizzy head that didnt last long big corny and grain aromas nice smooth flavor more corn grain white bread a just a bit of a floral hop finish much better than expected although as a lifelong michigander it should not have taken until today for me to try it
878,Redbridge,4,quite light and refreshing i enjoyed this for what it was a little watery but when youre looking for something light this is a good choice
879,Redbridge,2.23,wifes friend had this and offered two of these to her told me to have one and truthfully i was not able to finish it strange taste to me guess its the nongluten not my kind of beer
880,Redbridge,2.7,trying this out as i may need to go gluten free i so wanted this to be a good alternative first off its too carbonated for me the actual flavor is difficult to pin down but im not sure its a beer i could have more than one ofwhich will please my wife looking for a better solution
881,Redbridge,2.64,date february 19 2022 occasion back from the wmc semifinal loss we turn to the office and i to this beer to lift our spirits glassware baltika stonge an orangeamber body shows reasonable effervescence that builds a quarterfinger of offwhite sudsy head looks palatable light lemon zest toasted biscuit faint hard fruits honey and cough drop a rather clean refreshing ciderlike movement through the palate its start has a bit of hoppy chatter while its finish is refreshingly soft and swift not much of the limited aroma makes it to the flavor profilewhat does is honey pear apple wood and banana there isnt a lot to its substance but it does hit the genres goal well enough at its abv this wins for a long night of drinking as a standalone not too much to celebrate in can be found in most beer stores so that is also a plus
882,Redbridge,1.83,gluten free yes taste free yes i understand theres a market for this but this was almost undrinkable and got worse as it warmed sorghum makes for a funky musty overall aroma and taste blech
883,Redbridge,3.19,purchased as a single bottle from ingles for 150 poured into a nonic pint glass  l  clear amber with a onefinger sudsy offwhite head actually great lacing s  sweet but not in a sugary way herbal some kind of fruit but i cant pin down which one t  it tastes like literal raw sugar cane minus most of the sweetness  but i can tell its sweet if that makes any sense at all almost tastes of granny smith apple skin but then it doesnt a somewhat metallic finish it doesnt taste objectively bad though f  mediumlight body with nitrolike carbonation refreshing wet crisp o  this beers flavor has to be an acquired taste not for the reason i see many people drinking it i dont but because it doesnt taste bad but for the reason that im not familiar with the flavors present its this noncloying sweetness with some sort of herbal vibe minus the herbs it almost tastes like a sassafras soda but not in any sort of exact sense its almost like malta goya but swap the raisin bran flavor with some mysterious flavor youve never had that can only be in the area of molasses  but not really buy it to try it yourself but i probably wont again
884,Redbridge,5,i have celiac and redbridge is the best tasting gluten free beer
885,Redbridge,5,love this having to be gluten free is the absolute pits and i had no high expectations for this beer while it doesnt have that pungent beer smell its light and smooth and actually tastes great i was very pleasantly pleased and will definitely buy this brand again the beer guy at my local kroger said this was the best gluten free beer on the market right now ill agree
886,Redbridge,2.52,recently diagnosed with latedeveloping celiac disease looks like its redbridge and other glutenfree offerings going forward for this newly semiretired reviewer my reviews will steadily decline going forward run towards the fire with eyes wide open grinning eartoear my fellow reviewers
887,Redbridge,4.9,great finally a true gluten free beer send it to me for life would drink everyday
888,Redbridge,2.8,i had to try this sorghumfree beer  not that it was bad or good just different the strangest thing was the smell it had a cocacolalike odor to my nose i couldnt shake it anyway its nothing really bad but certainly nothing special either
889,Redbridge,3.42,got this since my girlfriend is gluten free  ive had it occasionally over the years it wasnt a stunner but felt like a reliable red lager drinkable and inoffensive
890,Vanilla Bean Assassin,4.86,12oz bottle2022 version drank 122522 pours dark brownblack not much carbonation smells of sweet chocolate vanilla and barrel taste is marshmallows soaked in bourbon perfect sweetness if there is a knock its slightly on the thin side but thats being picky probably the best adjunct stout ive had truly lives up to the hype
891,Impermanence,5,impermanence has a deep rich and opaque black color it has a creamy dense and longlasting head of tan foam that leaves attractive lacing on the glass impermanence is rich and complex with a strong presence of dark roasted coffee dark chocolate and a hint of dark fruit the coffee notes are bold and robust chocolate adds a smooth sweetness that balances out the bitterness from the roasted malts the dark fruit notes are subtle but add an extra layer of depth and complexity to the aroma overall the aroma of the impermanence stout is truly captivating and leaves you eager to take a sip on the palate impermanence has a rich fullbodied flavor profile that is both complex and satisfying the initial taste is a strong bitter espressolike flavor which is quickly followed by notes of dark chocolate and roasted malt this is balanced out by a hint of sweetness from the malt impermanence has a creamy and silky mouthfeel that makes it a pleasure to drink the texture is thick and smooth coating the palate the body is medium to full providing a substantial and satisfying experience with each sip the carbonation is low giving the stout a smooth and creamy finish without being too fizzy overall the mouthfeel of this stout is wellbalanced and luxurious overall tree house brewing impermanence is an outstanding stout with its rich flavor smooth finish and attractive appearance it is sure to be a hit with anyone who tries it
892,Impermanence,4.9,143 great milk stout
893,Impermanence,4.46,appearance pours near black with a two finger beige head good retention and leggy with a showering of lace  smell roasted malt dark chocolate caramel and coffee with maple syrup supporting  taste roasted malt dark chocolate and caramel forward with coffee vanilla and maple syrup adding a variety of dimensions finishes with lingering roast and maple syrup  mouthfeel medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation  overall a very nice milk stout that avoids the cloying sweetness that plagues many of the beers of this style the way the roasted malt and coffee offsets the sweetness of the caramel and maple syrup is impressive  thanks devoured_by_vermin for the opportunity
894,Impermanence,4.48,as a fan of stouts i wanted to try this milk stout wow this was really good albeit a little bit sweeter than i expected but overall it was great
895,Impermanence,4.27,16 oz can dated simply autumn 2022 on the bottom  pours inky jet black thick tan colored head the coffee and dark chocolate balances the maple and lactose a bit but still on the sweeter side full bodied thick and smooth feel
896,Impermanence,4.59,canned autumn 2022  for the second time in one tree house run we have yet another th beer in the ba top 250 this one currently sits at 168 and 2 for milk stouts just under their own moment of clarity funnily enough they are both milk stouts aduncted with coffee chocolate and maple syrup lets crack it open and see how they differ  pours completely pitch black with 3 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing  the nose is very sweet and mapleforward but theres a delicate balance from the roast im picking up on aromas of sweet maple syrup vanilla milk chocolate truffle caramel brown sugar medium roast coffee and light nougat  once again in taste theres a lot of maple but the balance is even more amazing here on the front end of the sip im tasting sweet maple toasted oak dark chocolate medium roast coffee brown sugar light coconut and dark caramel the swallow brings notes of sweet maple chocolate fudge dark caramel toasted oak brown sugar medium roast coffee and light molasses  a medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a a creamy but not syrupy beer finishes slightly sticky but not overly sweet  in a word wow maybe im a sucker for maple in stouts 2 of my all time top 10 beers are just that but this is truly awesome even better than moment of clarity tree house strikes again with this long time want of mine
897,Obsidian Stout,4.71,aroma is extremely enticing roasted malt and espresso with cacao and the body delivers on that promise a roasted punch loaded with espresso strong cacao very bitter and even a slight minty twinge to it on the back end probably the best straightforward stout ive had
898,Obsidian Stout,5,i like dark beers i tried coors light once budwieser shitz and the cheap ones make me ill for me the yummy beers are dark darker and darkest obsidian stout tastes great and is definitely not less filling im a one and done beer drinker so this one is perfect for me if this beer isnt sold in germany it should be i would take this beer over any hefeweizen any day  i noticed the label on the bottle i have is different from the label on the above photo however the name is the same deshits its dark and smelly too it definitely tastes better than the deshits name would suggest i really like this beer
899,Obsidian Stout,4,a very good traditional style stout pours a dark hue it has robust rich flavors of dark chocolate roasted malt and licorice i was fortunate to have it at the brewery itself
900,Obsidian Stout,4,rated the same way i do untappd  poured into a tulip glass  very dark in color tan head  coffee and subtle chocolate aroma  its an old school stout no big adjuncts big roasty character with espresso notes but it doesnt finish with the really assertive coffee bitterness it finishes a bit more smooth i think maybe there are some chocolate notes that are helping accomplish that quite enjoyable i tried it with some gouda cheese and it worked really well
901,Obsidian Stout,4.5,great beer
902,Obsidian Stout,3.97,appearance pours a black cola color with brown hues a small khaki colored foam head lacks retention  aroma roasted malts peanut shells and bread  taste roasted malts and a nice bitter hoppy bite up front coffee molasses and a little bit of chocolate in the middle slightly biscuity and fades into a milder bitterness that lingers around in the finish  overall this is a pretty decent stout the taste is surprisingly complex for the rather simple aroma
903,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.2,lets not be verbose yeah  looks fine smells like your standard citrus wheat tastes a little like fruity pebbles and is awful lite crisp and snappy carbonation kinda saves the mouthfeel but i wont be reaching for seconds
904,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,1.18,this was one of the nastiest tastings beers ive ever had it looked good but tasted like apple cider vinegar i guess if youre used to drinking crappy beer then this is a good one but if youre used to drinking craft beer then this rivals the cigarette ash tasting miller lite never again this could be the last beverage on earth and id opt to die of thirst
905,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.34,this is a refreshing beer it pours without much of a head and is light looking it has a distinct lemon flavor like the porch rocker variety but has more substance with the citrus and wheat flavors that accompany it good served cold in season
906,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.56,this is an okay beer nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary but it is crisp vibrant and smooth as well as refreshing for the summertime it has no real smell perhaps faint lemon peel the taste is faint lemon and citrus notes with a pinch of wheat overall this one is worth a try when in season iced cold and if youve at least never tried it before
907,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.21,pours murky yellow with a white cap that fades rapidly minimal lacing aroma is faint lemony and some grain flavor is also mild citrusy and bready feel is medium bodied with adequate carbonation overall just another drinkable beer without any outstanding qualities
908,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.38,this is another backlog rating where i know for sure ive had it and have a vague recollection of my thoughts on it not sure how this slipped through the cracks all these years
909,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,2.22,another americanstyle beer that is overly sweet to my taste this one resembles a higherend version of modelo especial or miller high life it does not have strong smells maybe has a faint hint of citrus but mostly has a nice easy not too intense taste with a lot of sweetness and a little more alcohol than is normal for this type of beer i thought it was quite good for what it was but would prefer less of a confection
910,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.57,a medium light haze in an orangeamber golden body nose is citrusy  a little more lemon than orange but a mix of both taste and feel seem a little watered down after that impression its a little spritzy in carbonation but fairly light and refreshing with a medium dry finish wheat influence isnt as strong as id hoped for and the citrus is a little weak on the palate with a mix of orange and lemon peel coming out as it warms
911,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,2.59,a great golfing beer refreshing with a little taste
912,Max,2.52,from a can purchased in seoul golden color with white head sweet grain smell light body tastes like it smells sweet grain with some corn and earthiness below average but drinkable enough makes me think the other reviews are a freshness issue
913,Max,2.35,it was an average malty beer very refreshing yet nothing to special about it over all 225
914,Max,1.06,i got max at the korean air lounge in the incheon international airport  it was from a machine where you place the glass and it tilts and pours for you the color was a urineyellow and the head almost felt coarse the whole time i was drinking max i felt like i was drinking metal there was an overarching metallic smell and flavor that took away everything else from a forgettable experience
915,Max,1.89,1113oz bottle purchased at the north spokane total wine for a price i forget i purchased this solely as a ticker beer as id never had a korean beer before i didnt notice the 04032013 stamp until today so this beer is definitely past its prime and once again way to go re freshness total wine  poured into a jever pilsener glass this was a chillhazed slightly amberish golden color with a miniscule white head that receeded to a thin collar in seconds despite the lack of head theres lots and lots of bubbles arcing skyward no lace at all  big crude grainy aroma and hints of white wine so 50 what i expected and 50 wtf  grainy malts with a side of diacetyl yum  light bodied but not as light as it should be lousily low level of carbonation  pretty awful in part due to age no doubt but i dont think there was much chance of anything commendable even if fresh oh well im a little closer to my dorky goal of having at least one beer from every brewing country on earth
916,Max,3,smooth low on flavor but smooth a good example of an aal
917,Iron City Beer,3.38,12oz bottle  on a hard pour 1 finger of white head forms then dissipates to a sporadic covering on top of a clear golden yellow body lacing attempts to form but fades to nothing average to decent aal  aroma is surprisingly malty with some corn and a mineralic crispness not a craft lager but for 900 a sixer this is decent not all that interesting but solid for the style and price  taste is again better than expected with the american lager yeast character being present but not offensive maltiness and corn is more subdued than expected from the aroma very clean but a bit boring super smooth  the feel is verging on light but thats what this beer is there is a surprisingly mediumlong finish the beer is relatively dry and very drinkable  overall im glad the first time ive tried ic lager they brew in their own facility this is a good relatively cheap american adjunct lager  long live pittsburgh the paris of appalachia
918,Iron City Beer,2.45,pours a clear sunset yellow brief fizzy head formation and retention or lacing nose is slightly sweet with some cooked vegetable vibes cheap caramel candy as well taste is slightly better though there is a very distinct metallic note finish continues adds a little sweetness and hop bite the main flavor i get is metal which is appropriate for the name feel is light without and without much punch to the carbonation certainly drinkable but not too much going on here
919,Iron City Beer,3.74,poured from 12ounce bottle into a stemmed glass goblet crystalclear dark amber with a center pour yielding a couple of fingers of pillowy white head that settled in short order they call this the beer drinkers beer and not without good reason looks like a beer tastes like a beer toasted grain on the nose and palate with notes of herbal hops grass and granny smith apple rather light in body with a slightly oily finish i could see pairing this with cookout fare which id guess is not a novel idea by any stretch a pleasant departure from insipid macro swill recommended
920,Iron City Beer,3,had not had an iron city for a long time until last week it was my first time drinking this beer since iron city brewing opened their new facility outside of pittsburgh no longer brewed by a contract brewery but made on premises it was very good those who remember iron city as a trash beer should give it a second chance
921,Iron City Beer,5,a great overall lager made by union workers who have a vested interest in the beers i would put this up against any german lager or pilsner has just the right amount of bitterness for a lager
922,Iron City Beer,1.22,sorry pittsburghs iron city fans but this just is not a very good beer pours bubbly and with very little head head goes flat quickly no aroma taste to match no detectable hops or much malt for that matter more like a soda as opposed to a beer had this years ago in the midseventies it was passable then but its gone downhill
923,Iron City Beer,5,was in town to see brothers koch perform live tried iron city solid in the throat lil putrid in the nose yins give it a try
924,Iron City Beer,5,this beer embodies the culture and history of pittsburgh sure it may taste smell and drink like any other local lager but its not about the beer its about the city it is perfectly solid and yeah thats alright but truer yet it is the beating heart of the city cheers to pittsburgh the paris of appalachia
925,Iron City Beer,3.08,on tap at primanti brothers in pittsburgh im not sure how to describe the taste something other than malt or hops kind of sour cardboard didnt finish luckily the burger was amazing
926,Iron City Beer,2.47,another beer from my brother in ohio wow this beer takes me back to my high school years when we used to drink this every chance we had not as good as i remembered surprised its still available oh well i gave it a try
927,Iron City Beer,4.12,16oz can stamped 0732 about 5 months old poured into a becher glass at fridge temp no abv listed on can the beer pours bright light amber in color with off white head the head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles the aroma is mild and beery notes of pale malt and mineral mostly the taste is semisweet pale malt with a hint of corny tang mild bitterness the mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish cleanly lagered overall very good aal i would definitely keep this around if it was local and fresh
928,Iron City Beer,4.71,as much as i like yuengling lager iron city has it beat a cool refresher that serves well in the heat of summer and pleases on cold winter nights great with foodespecially mexican pizza or chilior by itself
929,Harvest Ale,4.25,on tap mothership series 24 pretty good its got a nice balance of hop carmel and honeydew melon not super tasty bright vibrant honey dew melon the more earthy not quite bursting with flavor melon flavor subdued but in a way that works well for this beer glad i got to try it
930,Harvest Ale,4.35,pours amber with a 15 white head which lasts moderate lacing  aroma is floral citrus pine  taste is orange papaya light grapefruit pine  medium body moderate carbonation dry resinous finish  this is another outstanding ipa from founders
931,Harvest Ale,4.47,l pours a nice hazy orange color with a tall beige head with great retention s smells super fruity decent amount of citrus super piny nice malt backbone little bit of melon t follows the nose has a great balance between the biting hops  the sweet malt backbone f fullbodied moderate carbonation warming crisp biting slightly oily o really impressed by this brew will definitely buy again
932,Harvest Ale,4.19,this is nicely balanced and smooth but with a sharp hop bitterness that evens out well excellent
933,Rouge (Red),3.79,poured from a 330ml bottle   pours deep brown  thickly milky with a mocha head that leaves moderate lacing  the smell is subtle  very yeasty and earthy and the taste follows on from this  the subtly surprising me as i expected it to become robust  its still richly yeasty with hints of burnt caramel wood  minerals and plum with a pleasant bitterness  the flavour sweetening as it warms  the mouthfeel is voluptuous overall its heavy in a good way  rich but subtle in flavour i prefer westmalle dubbel which matches this in style closely but id not say no to this at all  if i have this again i think ill let it warm a while after pouring to begin tasting it  i like the sweetness and fruitiness that come as it warms 
934,Rouge (Red),4.25,330ml bottle  pours copper brown with 2 finger foamy white head pleasant on the nose with fruity notes and bready malt tastes of sweet dried fruit banana with a touch of malt and a gentle hop bitterness goes down very easy and it makes for an enjoyable beer
935,Rouge (Red),4,8623 poured from 33cl bottle purchased from the washington beer store in washington pa  this is our first chimay  poured a copper cloudy with beautiful offwhite head  aromas of brown bread stone with leah getting some apricot typical belgian nose profile as well green banana  flavors of metallic brown bread green banana as well roasty malt forward a sharp bitter brown sugar finish the bitterness reminding me of licorice a bit  thinner than i was expecting in the mouth feel  cheers to our first chimay
936,Rouge (Red),4.31,l chestnut brown body with a sudsy off white head good retention  s dark fruits brown bread raisin belgian yeast  t brown bread banana raisin toffee candi sugar light hops  f medium bodied sticky and dry finish  o classic example of the style and one of the best you can get
937,Rouge (Red),5,poured into my chimay glass  appearance beautiful amber color with a nice creamy head  nose very fruity especially dark fruits  taste taste follows the nose delicious dark fruits with plum the finish has a nice light banana taste to it with a medium mouth feel  overall this is an excellent abbey ale father theodore isolated the special strand of yeast used in this fantastic brew and this abbey ale tastes exquisite its quite expensive so when i savor this beer i do so on special occasions enjoy cheers
938,Rouge (Red),4.46,light copper with a 2 light tan head which lasts heavy lacing  aroma of belgian yeast fruits cinnamon  taste is belgian yeast spices fruits caramel toffee  medium body light carbonation spicy dry finish  a very nice belgian ale
939,Rouge (Red),4.41,330ml bottle in the beer house vientiane laos pours a cloudy copper colour aroma of fruit yeast and hops slightly acidic spicy and fairly well carbonated a bitter finish but the balanced flavours make this an excellent choice
940,Apex,3.37,august 16th 2016  bear republics apex predator is a trip to glacier national park in the glass it panders to the bear theme but also offers some good citrus pine notes plus the decidedly not parklike pineapple note i also get tastes of raw tomato and watermelon the flavor is milder and tickler than the aroma implies with a stickiness some dank touches ginger and orange candies its a little too sweet for me but not far from where id like it to be
941,Apex,3.53,from a 22 oz bottle with no date or code l darkorange and hazy with a mammoth offwhite head which reduces to a bubbly cap in minutes s oranges and pineapple honey and bread apricot nectarine a bit dank not bitter t it tastes like its past its prime but it aint bad caramel honey woody bitterness some grapefruit overripeness f full body a bit less than average carbonation somewhat resinous finish o the hop forward flavors and bitterness are barely a shadow of what they probably once were still an ok beer cheers
942,Sapporo Light Beer,2.25,i had sapporo premium light
943,Sapporo Light Beer,2.93,poured from a brown 12 oz bottle has a golden color with a 12 inch head smell is of grains malts taste is very mild some light grains feels light bodied in the mouth and overall is mediocre i would say its really no better or worse than most beers in this style
944,Sapporo Light Beer,3.38,from the 12 fl oz bottle with no bottling or best by date shown this one is brewed in the usa sampled on august 18 2017  the look is pale yellow great clarity and a quick lasting burst of fizzy white head then nothing  for a light adjunct this has some aromatic qualities including corn rice sweetness and grassy hops  the body is thin and watery however  the taste also brings out a pleasant enough corn and rice sweetness not the syrupy kind with a clean crisp and slightly zingy grassy finish im not a light beer fan but this one is easy to consume
945,Fundamental Observation,4.44,2022 vintage batch 8 served in my bruery snifter pours one shade shy of black complexion is opaque head ins loose and mochacolored and quickly disperses into a tight band around the shoulders and an oily slick across the surface nose is decadent vanilla caramel cocoa and spirits this is going to be decadently sweet taste follows nose  spirits are subdued and only come out at the finish the rest is just pure candy mouthfeel is medium in body with a semistill carbonation overall an amazing imperial stout
946,Fundamental Observation,4.54,500ml capped bottle into a bbt snifter  pours with a 1 finger dark mocha head beer pours heavy pitch black viscous sticky mocha legs nose is chocolate vanilla molasses and barrel pungent and rich beer opens chocolate vanilla and fudge hints of cocoa powder and roasted malt big barrel overtones more vanilla and molasses in the finish body is full with low carbonation sticky and viscous on the palate and goes down warm with a long lingering sticky aftertaste  this is great simple but well made amazing body
947,Fundamental Observation,4.89,one of my favorites from bl i only had b1 a few years ago but im catching up on my reviews
948,Fundamental Observation,4.68,received from a generous person in a nbs bif back in 2020 and split with a friend soon thereafter this is from the notes pours the color of strong coffee stout black i like to call it and is light blocking dark in the glass with just a little walnut hue on the edges the deep brown head is inviting and slow to dissipate the aroma gave me vanilla first bourbon second and the menagerie of dark fruits chocolate coffee wood char that make up the malts contribution to the smells very nice if a little more vanilla than expected the taste was solid the vanilla so heavily featured in the aroma was first on the tongue followed and overwhelmed my the coffeechocolatedark fruits almost cake like in effect not sweet exactly just decadent if that makes any sense the bourbon was in the swallow terminating the pastry party effectively the feel was a viscous pleasure for such an abv i like something with heft or body  to sip and savor not quaff down like some aal this nicely fits my preferences almost perfectly would love to try again but glad i got to try it at least once
949,Fundamental Observation,4.23,received from the evergenerous turkeysdrinkbeer in august 2022 and drunk in may 2023  l thick jet black utterly still theres a thin coat of rusty copperedcoloured foam atop the glass  s umami roastiness booze vanilla dark chocolate cocoa and ethereal spirit notes from the bourbon surprisingly this didnt change much as the beer warmed  t vanilla and bourbon notes dominate the initial swallow and then a wave of booze crashes over the top burning throat tongue and larynx like a good ris should theres a tangy hit of malt and then a retronasal whack of cookie dough settles in and lingers long warmth settles in the stomach and a medicinal sweetness slides in after the cookie dough fades theres an excellent balance to this beer  theres no danger of cloying sweetness nor is there so much stickiness that wasps begin to hover expectantly around my head  m mouthfeel is thick and unctuous  theres minimal carbonation but it suits the beer well as noted above theres warmth seeping lazily through my body at the halfway mark of this one and it settles deep and comfortably like an old familiar couch  o this is an enjoyable but intense beer experience theres no likelihood of a second beer after youve spent an hour or so in the company of this beer but the size of this beer means thats not a problem  cheers 242
950,Fundamental Observation,4.75,a real sweet treat its like a piece of portillos chocolate cake soaked in some tasty bourbon and then poured into a glass plenty of vanilla presence too full bodied big bold boozy and in no way overly thick oily or cloying a nice slow sipper because it really improves and opens up as it sits in the glass for a few hours
951,Fundamental Observation,3.98,previous review somehow deleted but from memory hit notes reminiscent of other chocolateheavy fudgey and dense stouts vanilla wasnt too prominent while mouthfeel had some light carbonation and was surprisingly moderate
952,Fundamental Observation,4.73,appearance fundamental observation has a deep dark brown color with a creamy tan head that dissipates slowly the beer is opaque and has good clarity  aroma the aroma is rich and complex with notes of dark chocolate roasted coffee dark fruit figs raisins and a hint of smokiness there is also a distinct hop character that adds to the overall aroma profile  taste the flavor is fullbodied and robust with a rich creamy mouthfeel the dark chocolate and coffee notes are prominent with hints of dark fruit toasted nuts and smokiness the hop character adds a pleasant bitterness to the finish  mouthfeel the mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a moderate carbonation that adds a nice effervescence the beer is fullbodied and has a long finish that lingers on the tongue  overall impressions fundamental observation is a wellcrafted complex beer with a rich flavor profile the aroma and taste are wellbalanced and the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy this beer is a great choice for those who enjoy dark rich and fullbodied stouts
953,Fundamental Observation,4.23,i had both the 2018 and 2019 vintage this review is for the 2019 vintage the 2019 is not substantially different going off memory although i think the body mouthfeel is a little thicker  surprisingly at 3 years this beer hasnt lost much any vanilla although refrigerated most of that time  the best part of this beer is either the taste or the smell the nose is loaded with what reminds me of buttercream icing  with a hint of something else perhaps the alcohol that you get off vanilla extract the taste is similar but the buttercream on the taste is more of something you have to use your imagination for its the essence but not direct flavor lots of deep fudgy chocolate a bit of alcohol on the back end which is unusual but i suspect is a result of the interaction with the vanilla while tasty i wouldnt say that the taste is complex  nothing exceptional about this beer but it is very good i think that my score accurately reflects how i feel about this beer and what i think it is deserving of
954,Westly,3.77,very acidic subtle apricot based on this vintage i prefer wa
955,Westly,4.26,sample at de garde 10th anniversary cloudy golden pour small bubbly head aroma is stone fruit and grapes taste is fruity tart with lots of funk and barrel notes
956,Westly,4.36,fantastic golden hue and white foam head that emits a fresh apricot orchard like aroma the aroma is a burst of freshly cut apricots and a hint of funk flavor is initially the fresh apricot flavor thats mostly sweet with tartness coming in behind it the finish though is overwhelmingly sour great overall but acidity is strong with this one which detracts a bit from the sweet apricot fruit like notes i enjoy most
957,Westly,3.86,look  fantstic yellowish color with a nice white head and lacing smell  sour super tartness taste  about the same as smell with some wood and citrus feel  medium body and lighter carb overall  not to bad horrible smell
958,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.31,a  pours a hazy golden orange with a thin white head tremendous amount of sticky lacing  s  aroma is orange mango grapefruit and dank hops  t  the taste is orange tangerine grapefruit strawberry honeydew lime peel and a lingering bitter hop bite  m  medium body with medium carbonation soft mouthfeel with crisp dry finish  o  really nice
959,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.54,canned 31023  i dont buy much other half since by the time it makes it to my area its usually a few months old that being said tavour has been getting me back into them lately with relatively fresh cans admittedly i shouldve gotten around to this one sooner since ive had it for a few weeks but im excited to try it regardless lets get into it  pours a cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  the nose is vibrant and tropical but theres a nice bitter hop character to it as well im picking up on aromas of orange juice lemon zest overripe cantaloupe floral hops bready malt gooseberry dank weed dried blueberry and light grass  and it manages to keep up that wonderful balance in taste too thankfully on the front end of the sip im tasting overripe cantaloupe pineapple juice bready malt grassy hops blueberry candy dank weed and light orange zest the swallow brings notes of orange zest gooseberry crackery malt dank weed grassy hops pineapple juice overripe cantaloupe and light grapefruit zest  a medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a smooth yet crisp beer finishes mostly dry and refreshing  oh yeah this one is great super drinkable for the style with a great balance
960,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.64,i thought i had this one before and loved it however that was double dry hopped double mosaic daydream and i loved that but i love this one too  hazy pale orange juice with little head and lacing hoppy citrusy scents of orange and pineapple slightly tangy and dank taste presents notes of dank tangy zesty citrusy notes of pineapple lemon and orange lighter to medium bodied very clean mouth watering subtle alcohol an excellent example of the style
961,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.48,16 oz can for 1099  canned on 101422  i had a 5 reward coupon so i scooped this one up for 699 look  golden and orange hazy creamy head good lacing throughout this session smell  mango blueberry orange peach little bit of dank ripe fruit taste  mango blueberry orange peach pineapple  sweet fruit flavor followed by some hoppy bitterness feel  soft medium mouthfeel lightmedium carbonation finish has a little bitterness and dryness overall  great brew that showcases the mosaic hops really nice fruit flavors come thru with a soft mouthfeel and a low bitterness at the end this brewski is smooth and goes down really easy at 85 abv its even more enjoyable while listening to dream warriors by dokken
962,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.49,poured from the can into a spiegelau ipa glass canned nov 28th 2022  light touching head with ultra fine bright white bubbles lots of pill like lacing and even leggy island creamy top with a soft shape sitting on a slightly hazed dark lemon with hints of noticeable fast rising carbonation  a bold nose dank hits of earth and must hop but also a real tropical passionfruit like flavor hits nice and spicy too with a bevy of hop explosive power nice and diverse but just misses the wow factor and other beer character balance  palate is just real nice juiced up and filled with a rich malt coating hop flavoring of passionfruit pineapple and a real jammy like texture coats a little chalky but also brings a real nice spicy earthy hop bitterness on the finish good notes of tropical variety too guava mango all sorts of fruit tropical goodness  very nice neipa with a good earthy bitter kick and tropical bonanza
963,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.52,really good neipa all around but only negative is that its bit chalky in the finish
964,Summerfest,1.88,dry bitter pretender of a pilsner from draft no head flat slight citrus doughy smell taste was more bitter than ibu rating refreshing at first but couldnt get over the bitter aftertaste that left my mouth dry reaching for water in fairness maybe it was a bad draft but i will steer clear of this
965,Summerfest,3.5,has a beautiful golden color decent head and practically no aroma the taste is lemony and light it is a fine and refreshing lager but im more likely to grab a slightly cheaper pack of miller high life or pbr jeremy piven probably loves this stuff  style lager  tapcanbottle can  abv 5  rating 35
966,Summerfest,3.75,its definitely better then that pilsner nooner its got a slight fruity taste in the background its a little bitter i thought this would be much more refreshing i think its the dry bitterness of it all
967,Summerfest,3.5,not a bad beer by any means just kind of boring imo another overhopped lager for those of you who love this stuff i will leave it on the shelf for you enjoy
968,Summerfest,3.92,poured from a 12oz can into a half pint glass pours straw gold with a slight chill haze to it a finger of soapy white foam head lemon and herbal notes on the nose taste follows its super easy drinking mediumfull mouthfeel bordering on thinner pretty good
969,Summerfest,3.94,color is clean and transparent and golden yellow nose is light lemon and mild yeast taste is a nice lemon tinged malty profile with a subtle hop dryness not too bitter just right excellent medium body with a smooth and clean finish some light carbonation through the taste and a bit of thickness at the end  overall a very worthy beer and one that should be brewed yearround just a bit different from other bohemian or czech style to make it fun
970,Summerfest,3.49,clear as a cloudless day lemon floral and biscuit on the nose and tongue yum yum
971,Summerfest,3.88,crystal clear straw yellow voluminous white head of looselargeish bubbles but the head goes away pretty quickly no real lacing nose and taste are both herbalgrass lemon zest with some barely there hop bitterness very easy drinking nice mouthfeel with moderate to mild fine carbonation and clean finish very easy to drink multiples of this on a hot day
972,Summerfest,2.88,not as refreshing as i was expecting still drank quite a few though
973,Summerfest,2.53,poured from 12oz can into my trusty guinness glass  golden yellow beer color nothing unique but its pretty kinda like a newscaster is pretty in a generic way  smells floral lemony and round full not quite lemon pledge but full even for my poor smelling  taste too spicyhoppy to be refreshing the can lied to me tastes like its trying hard to be a proper snobby craft beer instead of a drinkable lager or like sierra nevada just couldnt help themselves and made another ipa  feel a little thick and syrupy decent carbonation but the overly heavy feel kinda goes with the hifalutin beer thing  overall not for me
974,Summerfest,4.1,april  july 2023 seasonal release  6 pack 12 oz can dated 060523 60523  50 abv  28 ibu brewed and canned in chico ca or mills river nc poured into a bells branded nonic pint glass  look  pours a thin and fizzy offwhite head that dies down pretty quickly crystal clear golden yellow appearance with tons of streaming bubbles smell  the scent is mostly floral hops and lager yeast also picking up some woodiness and slight zesty lemon qualities taste  the taste follows the nose with the floral hops and woodiness dominating the most the slight bitterness seems to be cancelled by a lemon sweetness in the aftertaste feel  medium bodied with a semicrisp mouthfeel and finishes dry overall  nice hop characteristics for an easy drinking lager
975,Summerfest,3.53,meh not up to the hype not bad not great
976,Summerfest,3.71,look  clear pale straw white head that disappeared quickly no lacing smell  floral bready malt light menthol taste  lemon zest grassy bready fruity spice feel  light body and carbonation dry finish overall  so intrigued by all the pics posted and solid reviews of this lager that i had to pick one up and see for myself what all the hype was about pour was an old school pale straw and the scent brought back memories of the lagers i grew up on bready malts floral and a hint of menthol on the nose the taste is bready grassy and fruity but enhanced by the lemon zest and a bit of spice good brew that is a refreshing summer lager best enjoyed while listening to du hast by rammstein
977,Summerfest,4.29,good hop profile slight lemon and bread taste great summer beer
978,Brahma Chopp,3.85,kind of reminds me of old school american beer like old milwaukee but with buttery mouth feel
979,Brahma Chopp,3.28,poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass straw colored thin white head mild lacing abundant carbonation aroma of musty grains mouthfeel is light thin and frothy flavor of grain husks cracker some grassy hops in the background overall decent but thats about it
980,Brahma Chopp,1.77,this might be the best beer you can find in some parts of amazonian brazil a bottle makes it special remind yourself that the beer is just to stay hydrated and wash down the worlds best fish
981,Brahma Chopp,3.06,the first beer i had from brazil and it was better than i expected of course it is just a lager but it has a surprisingly sweet fruitiness to it thats still enjoyable and not overly sweet some might not like this feature about it but for me it is the very key to its uniqueness consumable fruity refreshing all good
982,Brahma Chopp,1.66,l very light gold beer very low retention s grassy sweet malt t sweet water grass clearly an immature beer f very watery carbonation is on the low side o there are better wouldnt go for a second try in this one
983,Brahma Chopp,2.97,355 ml bottle 480 abv exp 122017 ingredients water malt adjunct hops very clear and yellow liquid with little foam sweetness white bread and fresh grass on aroma all very faint the same with its flavor watery and smooth with a dry finish a bit too much of carbonation i havent taken one of those for ages and now i guess it has improved or maybe got back to what it was as no bad notes showed up for me in this bottle version
984,Brahma Chopp,2.76,can from festival de las naciones in teku glass playing the silent age no foam at all peculiar taste with plenty of white grapes and a champagnesque aroma and taste specially at beginning then it waters down
985,Brahma Chopp,1.93,nothing i would reach for if i had a choice
986,Brahma Chopp,1.87,i tried this against antarctica original and thought this was less clean it has a slightly funky taste and aftertaste still very similar and a typical light bodied adjunct lager clear light yellow pour with very little head taste has milled corn and fermented grains and adjuncts slightly metallic aftertaste feel is extremely light and a little fizzy i prefer the antarctica original in terms of brazilian aals
987,Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.17,for me this is a great change of pace beer i drink mostly light beers but i need a change up after 3 or 4 light beers one of these stouts is a perfect change then back to a few light beers i love the flavor and everything else about this beer i know this isnt the proper wine snob way to rate a beer i just cant do that
988,Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.4,on tap at cardinal pub  bar stavanger pitch black colour low brown head lovely aroma of oak roasted malts dark chocolate and coffee hints of leather roasty flavour dark malts coffee oak hints of chocolate and liquorice nice bitterness in the finish
989,Midas Touch,3.81,from the older bottle kept in the basement for years it poured a clear honey yellow color with a tiny white head that slowly reduced and actually had lacing the nose gets a dose of honey and possibly some grapes and spice taste follows nose with the smooth honey hitting first followed by the grape
990,Midas Touch,3.9,it doesnt smell ancient  it smells fruity and hoppy with malts in the background like a sweet smelling ipa  its bitter up front and a little spicy somehow  then the bready malts are really strong  it is also fruity the entire time  its a medium mouthfeel with a normal amount of carbonation  the finish tastes like a pastry both like bread and honey  its pretty damn good not as exotic as the description promises not a hint of saffron  its an interesting beer i give it a 47 out of 6
991,Midas Touch,3.71,pours golden yellow with a thin white head smells of honey white grape juice  grains subtle boozy aroma taste follows the nose this really reminds me of white grape juice that is carbonated it is good though mediumbodied moderate carbonation smooth finish very interesting brew i was happy to try it but i dont think i would purchase again
992,Midas Touch,3.64,opaque deep amber appearance with a small head and very little lacing sweet honeyish aroma with varying degrees of maltiness flavor reintroduces the sweetness as well as soft fruit grapes kiwi and spice particularly in the aftertaste vinous mediumtofull bodied mouthfeel long lasting finish
993,Midas Touch,2.61,all i taste is saffron who drinks this stuff on a regular basis
994,Notorious Triple IPA,3.77,draught medium orange with amber highlights for the look solid amount of toasted grain caramel malt tangerine peel for the aroma lots of tangerine peel caramel malt flavors the extra malt tames the hop bite as usual
995,Notorious Triple IPA,4.16,hoppy and piney with bitter grapefruit that counterbalances the alcohol sweetness from the tripe ipa makes it surprisingly drinkable for 12 abv
996,Notorious Triple IPA,4.4,poured into a seattle beer week pint glass pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing aroma of caramel malt citrus and piney hops orange mild mixed tropical fruit and pinea touch of green onion flavor is lightly caramel malt citrus and piney hops tangerine grapefruit pineapple mixed tropical fruit and pine needles medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess so great to find an traditional triple ipa with real malt flavor lots of fruit and pine and substantial bitterness in the finish i was struck but the mild sweetness of this one but with all the mixed fruit it fit perfectly some hotness but plenty of flavor to cover the abv well boneyard has always pleased with ipas and im not sure why ive never seen this one in my area before ill be looking for it in the future excellent
997,Notorious Triple IPA,4.46,look nearly clear rich orange with a reddish hue and the pour yields a thick pure white head that pillows up and slowly recedes leaving great lacing behind aroma i could smell it before i got close to the glass sweet orange peach strawberries pine sap cantaloupe a little cannabis rich honeylike sweetness rubyred grapefruit hawaiian bread tangerine and an eversoslight ethanol waft taste whoa a huge rush of mixed citrus fruits storm onto the palate as honeylike sweetness and berries start to mix in pine and dank herb appear from time to time and malt sweetness is everpresent and closes with a big hop bite and alcohol heat mouthfeel full slick slightly cloying but far from palatetaxing and decently dry on the finish along with some alcohol heat overall this is a bigtime beer and a good one at that this was my first time with this beer in years and was pumped when i saw they had finally canned it or packaged it at all but glad its not around often as its a huge triple ipa and it shows tons of hops tons of malt sweetness boozy and unabashedly so  you know its big but doesnt drink like its 115 a well done and tasty iiipa recommended
998,Notorious Triple IPA,4.35,growler filled 10 days ago in portland and arrived in ma not filled super high on the neck but carb was super solid really great old money beer super solid tipa from back in the day no haze at all super clear super tasty seek it out
999,Notorious Triple IPA,4.38,on tap at edison city ale house
1000,Notorious Triple IPA,4.11,wow usually double ipas are too strong for me this is a triple ipa and yet it is delicious it is incredibly strong but you have to expect that its like drinking port if port was really really good and tasted like an excellent ipa
1001,Samuel Adams Utopias,4.45,2017 vintage  shared with me from a friend small 2oz pour for each of us served in a small 4oz snifter tasting glass  appearance clear dark ambercopper color no lacing there wouldnt be at this abv  smell boozy  bourbon barrel notes honey toffee rich  taste lots going on definitely some barleywine notes with some bourbon oak vanilla toffee honey orange raisin and some bitter notes at the finish as well  mouthfeel surprisingly smooth for something this high in alcohol good thickness no carbonation dry finish and only a little warming  overall  drinkability i can see why some people describe this a more like a brandy than a beer and i almost want to call it a barleybrandy its got aspects of a barleywine but so much more glad i got a taste of it not sure i could finish a large glass of this though  definitely a slow sipping and savoring beer unique and quite tasty
1002,Samuel Adams Utopias,4.65,i opened a 2015 bottle about a month ago this is my third pour time for a review  i love how hybridized this is it finds such a lovely grey area between beer and liquor i can see calling this barleywine on steroids beautiful cognarmagnac notes are most prominent but there is room for plenty more smokey wood and tobacco raisinplum schnapps plenty of brown liquor hints of vanilla and honey plusjust so much more the body is wonderfully sticky and viscous  damn i wish i didnt like this as much as i do there is just no way to justify buying another bottle but this is absolutely worth trying once
1003,Samuel Adams Utopias,4.76,2019 vintage  pours a still dark mahogany amber red brown with notes of rich toasted nuts warm roasted malts sweet maple syrup pecans walnut dark dessert wines port sherry madeira some cognac liquor cherry toffee caramel bourbon oaky char hints of baking chocolate red grape mild bitter herbs caraway subtle spice raisins dark dried fruit brown bread fruitcake and a touch of vanilla feels mediumfull bodied slick oily strong and smooth overall a real great and unique barrelaged sipper
1004,Samuel Adams Utopias,4.5,had multiple years very unique and a must try for beer lovers just nothing like a beer more like an after dinner port than a good scotch but really enjoyable great conversation beer for a holiday party although quite costly
1005,Samuel Adams Utopias,4.59,not sure its worth the price tag but the 2021 vintage really did live up to the appropriate hype its super solid and the caramel and sherry notes remind me a little of a barleywine  but its its own animal definitely glad to tick this
1006,Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.89,look  black thick syrup but really nice rimming smell  lots of barrel with a nice vanilla and chocolate taste  chocolate vanilla and barrel feel  thick creamy medium light carb overall  just incredible
1007,Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.84,8202022
1008,Dale's Pale Ale,3.77,hazy dirty gold pour in a good way fluffy white head subtle hoppy aromas with slight citrus notes taste follows with stronger lemon zestiness nice dry finish good stuff
1009,Dale's Pale Ale,5,not sure you can improve upon this gem will mix with the vape tricks out of curiosity smells malty or is it hoppy always unique dig it
1010,Dale's Pale Ale,4.04,a a nice mahogany and dark copper color with some golden amber notes 2 finger frothy tan head  s bitter citrus and tangy oranges grapefruit and a faint earthy floral note noticeable caramel note not too complex but really nice smelling the sharpness makes the mouth water  t follows the nose caramel and crusty bread immediately followed by grapefruit some orange zest and piney resin  m solid medium mouthfeel with lowmedium carbonation  o old school pale ale right here earthy hoppy along with some malts nothing wrong with this at all its a great drinking beer
1011,Dale's Pale Ale,2.32,not a fan personally
1012,Dale's Pale Ale,3.37,acclimated to 50f and poured into an american pint glass  pours a clear dark dark gold maybe bronze with a 2 finger foamy lasting white head with heavy and sturdy lacing  whiffs of hop and marijuana while looking initial aroma is lightly hoppy with a slight marijuanaskunk presence smells slightly watery or diluted with notes of grapefruit pithrind smells almost sanitary somehow the marijuana note and diluted feeling fade after smelling a while and the grapefruit becomes stronger after agitating the hops become stronger  initial taste before swallowing is sweet bitter and slightly dank with grapefruit rind and caramel like maltiness after swallowing the grapefruit rind becomes a full on grapefruit oil taste that lasts into the aftertaste along with the sweet maltiness sitting on the middle top and sides of the tongue the hops manifest on the swallow bright and dry a black pepper kick is revealed in the roof of the mouth in the late aftertaste and a vague pine taste can be found throughout the bitterness builds as i drink it felt to me as though the flavors were were a little disjointed though thats likely entirely personal preference they worked alright  mouthfeel is slightly creamy and smooth which is enjoyable it goes down easy sort of crashing around the mouth  i dont think ill buy again honestly it was honestly good i just dont love it overall decent price though so maybe
1013,Dale's Pale Ale,4.57,beer much better than the average rating on here my opinion is that most beer advocate reviews correlate with price this is a reasonable priced beer so you can expect that the experts on here will rate it accordingly
1014,Dale's Pale Ale,4.02,look  deep gold big sudsy white head with staying power good lacing left behind smell  woody earthy hops floral malty taste  sweet malty floral citrus pine sappy aftertaste feel  medium light body low carbonation pine resinous finish overall  wow i remember the first time i had this and today i have the same thought cant believe this is a pale ale it drinks like a west coast ipa with the pine sappy aftertaste and pine resinous finish i know theres thousands of options out there today but dont sleep on this one pick it up if youve never tried it or pick it up again if you have dales is a classic tasty brew that i will enjoy again and again pairs up nicely with back for more by ratt
1015,Dale's Pale Ale,3.82,picked up some of these on st patricks day to try for half  halfs decided to try one again today on its own  l pours a rich copper with a 3 finger almost creamy beige head with excellent retention leaves nice lacing and when the head finally dissipates it leaves a thick beige cap a little dark for the style but otherwise gorgeous  s fairly simple yet quite pleasing sweet malt and grapefruitfloral notes from the hops  t flavors follow the nose but the sweet is toned down a bit by the hop bitterness which is welcomed for this style of beer this really combines nicely into a pretty nice session beer  f ample carbonation pretty crisp and finishes extra dry good for sessions but you may need some water on hand to combat the dry mouth  o pretty solid beer overall my main gripe with this beer is the extra dry finish while i am a fan of beers with a semidry or even dry finish depending on style this one is just a bit too much for me was decent for half  halfs the hop bitterness was actually a little too forward this pale ale definitely tows the line of ipa but is an interesting take on an american pale ale
1016,Dale's Pale Ale,3.81,really good beer available widely in the midwest i know its not a good micro but for what it is excellent
1017,Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,4.41,22 oz bomber 2015  a pours pitch black with a thin mocha colored head minimal lacing throughout  s dark chocolate comes through immediately with undertones of vanilla there is a light undercurrent of cinnamon wafting in the background i take an extra strength whiff for science and only then can i start picking up some stale oxidation characteristics it is nearly imperceptible and has no real impact  t following closely from the nose the flavor starts off with smooth dark chocolate dominating at first with the vanilla providing ample support as the beer warms to room temperature the cinnamon starts its move from the periphery to becoming a more integral component cinnamon is something which can easily be off putting to me in larger doses but here it is well integrated and nicely complements the stronger chocolate and vanilla flavors no perceptible heat or spiciness to me from the chile peppers its quite possible this aspect has faded over time i do think there are some remnants adding to the total flavor profile but im just not able to easily pick them out the only slight knock i can give is that the barrel characteristics are minimal  m  slightly oily with a medium body carbonation medium has held up quite well  o  for whatever reason i had low expectations going in for this beer after being cellared for six years however it has held up remarkably well in that time i regrettably did not have this beer when it was released so cannot give any comparison on its own its a delicious beer
1018,Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,4.64,i received a can from fbarber in a bif canned on 1292020 poured into a snulip glass i took it out of the fridge about 2 hours before pouring then put it back in about 15 minutes before pouring it pours a very dark walnut  approaching black the medium mocha head dissipated very quickly a sign of the alcohol content lots of raisin on the nose along with roasted malt chocolate a whiff of freshlybrewed coffee and earthy charred nuts you can also readily smell the bourbon barrel this is right in my wheelhouse tastewise it opens with bakers chocolate and coffee but the raisin has carried over as well there are also notes of caramel and earthy char and the caliente pepper adds heat the bourbon barrel is strong but not distractingly so as the glass warms i think the chocolate is stronger and a bit sweeter and the pepper hotter the feel is viscous and creamy with lite carbonation and theres no avoiding the 14 abv the 12 oz format is appropriate overall this is a superb example of ris  my favorite style and it richly deserves its worldclass rating i really like the combination of the chocolate malts and dark fruit
1019,Pilsner Urquell,3.74,from a 169oz can pours a light ambergold with a fluffy white head and looks perfect for the style which i guess it should being the og smell is of lager malt and saaz hops taste was lacking at first but finished with a nice bitterness taking time to chew the beer brought out more flavors of citrus pepper and grass quite nice but less than i was expecting from its reputation
1020,Pilsner Urquell,3.5,this is not what i remembered from drinking this in my youth i guess not many things are it is ok but i like other modern pilsners better than this oh well
1021,Pilsner Urquell,4,an enjoyable family matters themed beer  style czech pilsner  tapcanbottle bottle  abv 44  rating 4
1022,Pilsner Urquell,4.04,crushable and smooth yet excellently fullflavored delightful na zdrav√≠
1023,Pilsner Urquell,3.69,a good pilsner the original for that matter it yields only 44 abv but it doesnt seem like it once youve downed a couple the smell is pleasant and the color is a nice solid gold this beer is very easy drinking yet boasts a complex array of flavors that come to you over time from hoppy bread tastes to a sour dry finish
1024,Pilsner Urquell,4.83,the original pilsner  just because youre the first doesnt mean youre the best  the above statement doesnt apply to this beer and theres not a bad thing i can say about this beer one wouldnt be out of line in saying pilsner urquell is 1  a crisp and refreshing yet sippable and full flavored pilsner
1025,Pilsner Urquell,4.33,poured from a pint can into a frosty cold mug not too malty not overly crisp good amount of hops with a slight bitterness in the finish goldilocks would be a fan its just right
1026,Pilsner Urquell,3.84,not as much pilsner malt in the aroma or taste which is what i like in a pilsner but overall its a very good beer
1027,Pilsner Urquell,5,just came back from a trip to europe where i visited czechia and germany i had the opportunity to tastedrinkguzzle pilsner urquell filtered and unfiltered at plzen i have to say it tastes nothing like the cans or bottles sold in the us this beer has no equal in taste mouth feel and character it made me change the way i see lagers this beer is rich with nuanced flavor that changes from the sweet moment the solid white foam touches your lips through the hop bitterness that hits you at the back of your tongue to the floral accents felt in your nose when exhaling it felt like a snack when just drinking it at a bar and like another dish when having it with a meal i also had german lagers on the same trip and while these are fantastic pilsner urquell is in my opinion the queen of all beer
1028,Pilsner Urquell,5,die besten
1029,Pilsner Urquell,4.31,excellent beer
1030,Pilsner Urquell,4.5,its only fault is its low abv are bottles here as good as on tap in czech nope but again tap reigns if they keep their tubes clean still trying to find an american pilsner that has that same loving bite and taste looking up the steps they use to produce it not sure if doubling the hops homebrewing will make things come close im going to give it a try though as it is an unparalleled ale
1031,JJJuliusss!,4.52,thanks nick vigorous pour produces an amazing smell taste follows juice bomb really tasty great medium feel overall everything i would expect from this legendary brewery touche
1032,JJJuliusss!,4.32,from a 16oz can into a tulip drank this last night and i forgot to record the canning date sometime midnovember 2022 can message stay gold pony boy  pours an opaque brownish orange with about one finger of white head incredible lacing and retention  strong aromas of oranges and earthdirt  taste follows but mellows on warming with a little less distinctness  soft medium to fullbodied mouthfeel bitter aftertaste medium carbonation  this beer is excellentfor what it is seems to be missing that little something extra that most of their dipas have that said if you hand me one of these im gonna drink it smiling
1033,JJJuliusss!,4.52,its with a jaw tightening lip smacking mouth watering series of sensations that gives tree houses power packed julius a newer and juicier life thatll leave us stuttering for more  the excellence in jjjuliusss is felt starting with a similarly creamy peach and golden blend of colors and airy textures as the original julius the beers dense and foggy appearance only works to make it more appetizing a slow separation of ale from froth suggests a viscous character that carries over to an even more creamy tangy sweet and fruity taste just after a grassy citrusy herbal and piney perfume than any before  less grassy and herbal in taste the flavors that explode on the middle palate are dominant with allthingsorange tangerine in all its tangy fructosesweet branchripe and fresh squeezed vibrance springs to life with a zesty support of red grapefruit lemon and lime tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple and kiwi nuances smooth in the beers fleeting taste a sense of bitter sherbet with citrus zest apply their final and lasting contributions to balance  creamy and maltydry the taste starts fuller and plush but trailing bitter herbal and dry the soft sappiness of freshly shaven spruce links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative texture and a nearly teethchurning creamy tartness that aligns itself with sorbet desserts its surprising that a single sixteen ounce can can hold so much flavor
1034,Tennent's Super Strong Lager,1.93,consumed at the san siro stadium in milan along with some very terrible foodtruck food i mean what is there to say its ungood sweet white bread malt flavour and an array of astringent flavours metallic skunky nailpolishremovery medium carbonation and medium body very bad
1035,Tennent's Super Strong Lager,2.77,i found a can in the off license neary the chippy so thought id follow steve from beer nouveau  treat it like barleywine pours a crystal clear golden body with really good white head aroma is butterscotch flavour is sweet toffee and its really pleasant till a metallic aftertaste
1036,Tennent's Super Strong Lager,2.97,decent fizzy head clear tan color  nose a bit macro lager unfermentables touch skunky mild lager notes quite sweet and little fruity  taste more sweet malts plenty of sweet and syrupy little lager notes fruity little alcohol candy sugar syrup touch skunky and unfermentables  mouth syrupy sticky sweet med decent carb
1037,Tennent's Super Strong Lager,1.81,i saw this a lot in rome and finally ordered it out of pure curiosity pours a clear golden color quickly dissipating head and that leaves a thin ring the aroma is all about the alcohol putting it up to my nose it smells like vodka there is some cereal grain in the aroma however its mostly overshadowed by the booze the taste can be described as a sticky gooey and sweet cereal grain the alcohol again vodka is all over the place the body is medium but as it is tough to get through this one hard to drink especially as it warms this is like a european malt liquor the only benefit i can see is if you want a quick cheap buzz as long as its drunk ice cold personally those are not qualities i seek in a brew
1038,Tennent's Super Strong Lager,3.2,good industrial strong lager good for get drunk
1039,Summer Shandy,3,having really enjoyed the samuel adams porch rocker of a similar style and really enjoying that i was very let down by this beer it tasted like lemonheads candy that had been shaken up in a water bottle and then poured into a lager very watery and artificial tasting  style fruit beer  tapcanbottle bottle  abv 42  rating 3
1040,Summer Shandy,3.14,was looking for something akin to cider only one and after work and its a very rare urge for me didnt see anything that matched so i went with a 24 oz of this havent had it in years last i recall was a very artificial pine sol after taste seems to be gone in the smell pours a hazy big lasting head good retention and lace tastes sweet with lemon zest i assume to balance on the finish decent enough
1041,Summer Shandy,3.17,lemon mixed with a faint weiss beer good mouthfeel weak smell overall its sippable but not stellar old lemonade is the most prominent taste not bad on a hot day though
1042,Summer Shandy,3.39,this is a situational beer tons of lemon and lemon zest for aroma and taste nice smooth feel this shandy is something id be pleased to find at an outdoor party with it is 85 out or in the fridge after doing yard work however other than those times when you need something really refreshing and maybe should be hydrating with something other than a beer anyway the lemon would probably be too much
1043,Summer Shandy,3.27,poured from a 24oz can best by july 17th 2023  on a hard pour a good amount of head formed filling most of the glass retention was decent but after getting distracted the head was thin but maintained a cap then i poured the rest lacing forms at an average rate very hazy golden yellow body  aroma is real almost fresh lemon juice which i appreciate a lot actually a bit of sweet malt sits right behind the fresh lemon aroma bringing a definite sweetness  taste isnt quite as bright as the aroma eith zero tartness and a zesty lemon flavor that quickly leads into a sweet malty and wheaty but also plain american wheat beer base essentially zero hops i want either more beer or more tartness from the lemons this comes off as a bit sweet but still has a refreshing summery character  the feel is actually quite nice outside on a hot day straight out of the can this is fantastic but other than being a fancy easy to drink and maybe even chuggable lawnmower beer it isnt really even worth it to pour in a glass no wo der they only make it during summer  overall this beer is very setting dependent out of the can while outside this is a great radler but out of a glass with dinner its a bit sweet and lacking in tartness for being a lemon radler
1044,Summer Shandy,3.48,leinenkugels summer shandy 42 abv pours hazy orange with a onefinger white head that mostly dissipated while i struggled with the camera to focus on the damn beer nose is predictably lemon taste is lemon faint sweetness slight bitterness ok mouthfeel overall fair i left half behind when my takeout order was ready and was relieved not to finish it
1045,Tucher N√ºrnberger Rotbier,3.34,500ml can from brewers haven dark amber pour with abundant offwhite fluffy head malty aroma brown bread taste is malty with mild sweetness some vegetal notes towards the finish but does not distract from the beer
1046,Tucher N√ºrnberger Rotbier,3.83,appearance is a darkcloudy dark amber close to medium carbonation with a medium body all adding up to a nice feel aroma is maltdark bread grain and buckwheat honey taste is maltybreadgraindark honeywith a little bread overall this is an excellent beer
1047,Tucher N√ºrnberger Rotbier,4.06,pours a deep amber color with a generous head of beige foam  aroma has a combination of malt fruit and toast  taste has a delicious fruit toffee and malt flavor smooth  a unique and delicious medium bodied dark lager  bom 72023
1048,Tucher N√ºrnberger Rotbier,4.13,pours a dark hazy brown color with a generous head and lacing aroma has dark fruit toffee and malt hints taste has a pleasant dark fruit toffee and malt flavor a medium bodied well carbonated beer a good dark lager
1049,Tucher N√ºrnberger Rotbier,4.17,can this isnt the prettiest body to look at with a muddied red ale look to it though it has a decent and sustained head to make up for it based on what i read and my experience this version of the style seems a little bit in between the maltiness of a marzen and a mildly hoppy red ale  the toasted malts drive the flavor and a tealike to earthy to dark nut bitterness evolves to keep the malts from expanding on the sweetness they provide the nose is of a medium grain bread which comes through in the taste at times the flavor reminds me of a breakfast bread that someone left the sugar out of or at least mismeasured it on the low side  other more minor notes include a little malt tang and some medium strength iced tea in fact that tea sensation feds into a dark nutty bitterness the one that continues to balance the malt sweetness even as it strengthens a little bit as the beer warms this warmth also brings a bit of a little bit of molasses to the aroma and taste which i didnt notice when it was colder overall a malty beer that doesnt run sweet with a bitterness that compliments the malt quite well in my opinion
1050,Tucher N√ºrnberger Rotbier,4.25,a pours a near opaque reddishorange color a towering beige head forms with excellent retention and lace all the way down the glass s a big malty presence toasted biscuit toffee dark fruits the malt character is incredibly inviting and like some of their other beers reminds me of walking into a bakery t again all the malt character you could want dark toasted and baked bread toffeecaramelized malts and dark fruits certainly sweet and a rich malt profile though far from cloying or unbalanced in anyway i just love the malt character here mo a full body with crisp carbonation that also becomes ultra smooth and silky this feels like it should have more abv though because it is not high in that regard this is incredibly moreish to drink  i love the rich malty character here in that regard it is almost in the doppelbock range but with a much lower abv than is typical for that style which makes this all the more easy and inviting to come back to all around well done
1051,Tucher N√ºrnberger Rotbier,4.25,a beautiful opaque and hazy amber pour with a big fluffy foam cover smells of sweet biscuits and bread taste of caramel malt with biscuit undertones sweet and velvety very drinkable with a rich and silky mouthfeel very interesting and unique example of this old traditional franconian style
1052,Tucher N√ºrnberger Rotbier,4.29,half liter vom fass at hexenh√§usle in n√ºrnberg paired beautifully with the local sausages and kartoffelsalat that i ordered on the lighter side but a gorgeous beer balanced sweetness throughout with a proper finish and feel so easy to drink so delicious an all night kind of beer
1053,Tucher N√ºrnberger Rotbier,4.29,169 oz can canned april 27 2023 into a tall lager glass l pours red  murky burnished copper with plenty of fine steady carbo bubbles a thin creamy light tan head that recedes to a thick skin with dollops of foam very good lacing s rich caramelized malts raisins plum dates dark fruits brown bread quite malty t heavy caramelized malts figs brown bread crust dark fruits tannins light citrus zest which dries the finish quite a bit has a light aged wooden halo about it and a light linger there is a touch of acidity and only a slight aftertaste moderately rich and lightly sweet f brisk firm lightly creamy mediumbodied feel with a smooth middle and a mediumlength finish that is quite drying on the tongue o wow aroma and taste are quite similar here extremely pleasantly balanced fruit tastes along with succulent malts makes for a lovely drinking vienna lager that is imho worldclass i will get this again as it must be paired with meats  cheeses
1054,Tucher N√ºrnberger Rotbier,3.84,from the big can it pours a very slightly reddish amber color with a very nice thick light tanoffwhite head that slowly reduce and leaves lacing the nose gets as someone described it a bit of astringency with notes of caramel and malt the mouth gets a nice maltiness with notes of caramel roasted malts and some brown bread nice rendition of the newly rediscovered style
1055,Tucher N√ºrnberger Rotbier,4,got one at bratwurst r√∂slein actually a very good beer strong malt back with light hoppiness
1056,Traditional Lager,3.75,we in the big leagues son raul up and in the southwest like the maids cleaning up at truly best drinking this syrup on the way to europe and you know what it good awooooo like a wolf going through puberty  letsssssss gooooooooo
1057,Traditional Lager,4.77,go to inexpensive us beer  waiting for it to come to canada or even vermont 
1058,Traditional Lager,3.06,perfectly drinkable lager great for the price and for sessions
1059,Traditional Lager,3.27,i had this first at a wedding and its exactly that a fine wedding beer looks great in a glass or bottle tastes malty with a barely existing note of hop i get this fizzy feeling on my tongue a perfectly fine choice at an event
1060,Traditional Lager,3.32,this is a very serviceable lager though technically not a macro or aal i put it in the same category and it is my favorite of the group in a cooler full of aals at a party im going with this one every time the main drawback for me is that i get almost no aroma which is unfortunate  i find that there can be some variability sometimes a get nice caramel honey on dark bread other times the caramel seems more syrupy either way for the price and purpose this will do just fine
1061,Traditional Lager,4.44,this is my go to beer when i am out at a restaurant or i am hosting a backyard bbq 9 times out of 10 this beer will not let you down it tastes great is thirst quenching drinks very easily and you can have several in a day and not really get hammered my only issue is that when drunk from a bottle i have definitely encountered entire 6 packs that are off and skunky on tap and from cans are definitely better options as i fear that the green glass bottles lend themselves to sun damage yuengling traditional lager is going to always be a yes from me
1062,Traditional Lager,3.8,not all beer serves the same purpose not all beer needs to elicit rave reviews when sipped thoughtfully from a glass in isolation this is a working beer enjoy it after an evening of mowing the grass in the summer heat gulp it down in between bites of yakitori hot off a charcoal fire drink it straight from the bottle  this is the only macro brew ive always come back to
1063,Traditional Lager,3.43,this is one of the best mass produced beers it has a clear amber color with medium to light carbonation and a slightly sweet and malty aftertaste a little more hops would balance the taste and greatly improve it overall at 45 abv you can enjoy quite a few without adverse effects the next day
1064,Space Trace,5,081123 bottle  home
1065,Space Trace,4.55,even though there seems to be fluidity in the top 250 this will be my 75th on the list definitely see why it is on the list pours dark minimal head and lacing strong scents of bourbon coconut and chocolate this follows to the taste as its very sweet and boozy but the flavors blend well big bodied just a hint of oiliness not thick or syrupy but assertive alcohol burn really tasty
1066,Space Trace,4.55,a  pours a motor oil black with a thin tan head oily lacing  s  aroma is coconut vanilla dark chocolate and bourbon  t  the taste is dark chocolate coconut vanilla coffee and a nice amount of bourbon barrel  m  full body with medium carbonation chewy mouthfeel with a slick dry finish  o  really well done coconut is there but doesnt overpower the flavor good amount of barrel throughout
1067,Space Trace,4.27,2018 version poured from a 169 oz bottle into a snifter i thought this would be sweeter but i think it is quite good with the cacao standing out more than the coconut some booze heat to back it up
1068,Space Trace,4.61,rating this from coming across 4 coconut beers  prairie pirate weekend is number one so far this is batch 003 l poured from a 500ml bottle into a snifter  jet black pour with 1 fingers length of dark malty foam risen to the surface s big fudgy chocolatey aromas of coconut cacao vanilla hazelnut even getting some lactose in this can sense its very sweet t just as the aroma tells browniemilk chocolate cacao coconut hits first followed by some vanilla in the middle and a hazelnut ending i love this one this is my favorite bottle logic barrel aged to this day f heavy oily thick bodied easy to sip hides abv very so well o this is hard to compare with prairie pirates weekend but man this takes the top spot my new all time favorite coconut chocolate stout of all time the reason is because the milk chocolate was there cacao was there coconut was there followed by the complexity and thickness of the beer two separate beers but id be very curious to see if they aged this in rum barrels this might change the whole stout game itself if that were to be the case
1069,Space Trace,4.61,2023 batch sweet milk chocolate creamy coconut and hint of vanilla bourbon barrel nose on this one taste follows with a moist chocolate fudge brownie with some coconutvanilla drizzle on it finish ha yum the barrel is subtle here but it comes out more as it warmsa little more chocolate malty roastiness peeks out as well this is a delicious coconut stout
1070,Space Trace,4.4,brownish black pour with a fat finger of brown foam starting with the taste has the lead of bourbon coconut chocolate and vanilla in that order of intensity smell is more chocolatecoconut truffle like with more melding balance with the barrel but same elements feel is malty and barrel forward smooth and warm oak toastiness is refined
1071,R√ºb√¶us,4.17,now two twelve ounce brown bottles have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug it was a foamy pour theres just way too much justoffwhite and pinkish tinted foam to make this a pretty pour just as the norm this foam recedes unevenly and unattractively only in this case its a slow process the color of the liquid body beneath all the foam is something in the dark copperamber or light mahogany category it will leave irregular glass lacing as ugly as it looks there is a nice raspberrymalt aroma that makes this appealing its opaque without being murky the taste is a very nice delivery of raspberry within a brew that includes some hops yeast and even a little malt its sweet but not bothersomely so with a finish that bitters and drys things out the mouthfeel is surprisingly wonderful considering all the initial foam with the hop bite finish this may drink more like a raspberry aipa than a fruited sour its body is also better than most fruited sours and more like a nice aipa whatever if you like a good dose of raspberry in your brew this is a good option
1072,R√ºb√¶us,4.24,the beer looks beautiful a light clear red with a one inch white head emerges in a pint glass the nose is all raspberry semisweet with a bit more sour the taste once again all raspberry sweet and sour a bit more balanced on the taste vs the nose the mouthfeel is good balanced nicely between sticky and watery but a bit cloying and dry on the aftertaste which in this case is not a bad thing it emulates actual raspberries overall im impressed if i were to design a beer to taste like a robust raspberry brew i would want it to turn out like this damn good beer
1073,R√ºb√¶us,4.37,it smell like a raspberry that is a very good thing the head is thin and white and the ale looks pink with bits of raspberry in it it is a bit sweeter on the flavor as i favor sour in a fruity ale but it is not too sweet
1074,R√ºb√¶us,4.21,i got a bottle of this beer of this beer from a christmas gift basket that my sis ans brahinlaw bought for me it poured a clear pinkish amber with thin white ring head that is not leaving any lace the scent had beautiful raspberry notes the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with tart berry presence the mouthfeel was medium in body and had good carbonation overall it is a great beer
1075,R√ºb√¶us,3.75,smells very raspberry and fruity taste like sweet and tart raspberry with a nice balance between the sweet and tart theres a slight yeast taste in the finish this is more like a cider than a beer but not bad
1076,R√ºb√¶us,4.37,got a nitro draft from city tap in a pint glass with a finger of white nitro head on top smells mildly of raspberries very pink color taste is excellent only mildly sour a little sweet and lots of raspberry flavor light bodied with a very creamy nitro texture excellent nitro tap

1085,Beatification,4.17,sent my way as return fire by beersnake1 during nbs bif16  pours a pure golden yellow thats mostly clear but i wouldnt describe as crisp the colour actually isnt far off from a slightly lighter version of the label wet bubbles rise through the liquid but theres no head and thus nothing to retain nor leave lacing  nose is bright and inviting starts off much more on the fruity side rather than the truly funky side were getting there though dont worry with some apple and like meyer lemon the apple transitions to a mustiness that gives rise to thoughts of wood and carries us over to the earthier funkier side with light elements of barnyard and just a kind of tart element  flavour is awash with an interesting lead in that i want to give credit again to that meyer lemontype flavour then bits of crabapple and wood giving way to the earthy funk again which presents in a really interesting way that i can only think to describe as open i dont know how that works but where a lot of funky wild ales like this feel tight compressed bound up tartness this feels like the pages spread wide and a more easygoing but no less pronounced welcoming earthy funk the lemon and the funk kind of build together to a pinnacle about 23 of the way through that is more in the horse blanket realm and borders on harsh though the rest of it feels aggressively tart but in a welcoming manner the back end takes elements from all of the above along with a little bit of bleu cheese and faint honey to leave a tart dry finish  very fine carbonation sits atop a decidedly funkytart beer but one that i wouldnt describe as sharp  ive had several in the ation series and theyve all been top notch this is no exception thanks tim for sending this along my direction
1086,Beatification,4.68,bottled 4320 poured at 52 deep gold with excellent clarity thin tight white head poor cap retention leaves a small island of micro dots brief thin ring no lace mild funk apples and oak nose tart green apple pear mild funky horse blanket white grapes middle oak mild tart fruit on backend light body moderate minus carbonation crisp dry finish overall the funk is mild drinks like a lambic style minus the barnyard intensity very approachablea perfect gateway beer for those not familiar with belgian lambics who want to dive in
1087,Beatification,4.79,had this on draft at a place with one of the early rrbc accounts in my area it brought me back to my first pilgrimage to rrbc in santa rosa at the 4th street location i thought i was there for the ipas but a family member ran into someone they knew with a goblet of another rrbc barrelaged product who said i dont even like beer but i love this i ordered my own goblets and was introduced to the loveliness of sanctification and consecration  so began my love affair with rrbc barrelaged stuff the 100th percentile score is wellearned this is a delicious sour which offers common ground to people who normally will not drink sours the more sophisticated reviews for this will fill in all the notes of stonefruit and granny smith apple stuff that my review lacks all i have to say is in the same way that you could serve pte to someone who would never touch a dipa with a tenfoot pole a goblet of this can evangelize regular folks with unsophisticated palates like mine to appreciate the wonder of wild ales and sours made by skilled people

1091,Beatification,4.16,look is goldenyellow smell is really funky taste same as the nose funk on the tongue overall one of the tastier russian river wild ales ive sampled

1096,Devil Over A Barrel,3.92,this one pours a fairly dark black color with a small head and not much lacing  this smells roasted coffee beans and espresso milk chocolate oak smoke and bourbon with a touch of a vegetal aroma  this is solid up front but theres this odd and stale vegetal taste on the back end that seems to be the beginnings of the coffee turning towards the dreaded green pepper phase fortunately up front the coffee flavor is nice lightly smokey and roasty a nice chocolatey porter base theres a little bit of bourbon and its melded into the flavor nicely and doesnt dominate or stick out too boozily  this is medium bodied fairly creamy and surprisingly rich for the abv and style its fairly drinkable  this has a slight offflavor on the back end but its otherwise a solid beer
1097,Devil Over A Barrel,4.34,what do you do when you are awash in beer  tavour keeps sending more hold everything in abeyance on station until late night new beer sunday lnnbs week 711  from the bottle sinful  brand devil over a barrel style imperial oatmeal porter brewed with coffee beans  aged in bourbon barrels statement of composition 60 porter brewed with coffee beans and aged in bourbon barrels 40 porter brewed with coffee beans brewers gone wild a series of big bold ballsy beers  i am up late or early  now it is time for some coffee i popped the cap  began a cline pour into the awaiting glass i was dissatisfied with its initial production of head so i performed a vigorous inglass swirl to raise just under two fingers of dense foamy rocky deeptanlightbrown head with moderate retention leaving loads of lacing in its wake color was blackopaque srm  44 allowing zero light penetration nose was redolent with coffee  it was like i was mansplaining on f night  porters might be close to stouts but they do have differences  porters often recieve adjuncts as a result of their receptiveness coffee  fruits being the most prevalent the nose also had a light wafting of coconut which i now recognize as bourbonbbl aging mouthfeel was mediumtofull not quite creamy but close i allowed it to warm in my mouth on my tongue  coating my palate all bringing out a rich bourbon flavor underlain by dark black coffee mmm cigars with coffee infused with a shot of bourbon on the fantail of the sdts  i was not happy with my shore duty assignment to an underway vessel but being that it was mostly sillyvilians things were more relaxed this beer was evocative of those evenings anchored or moored in the lee sides of the channel islands i no longer smokes cigars thanks to adultonset asthma but i miss the heck out of them especially when drinking something like this i have never been a huge fan of bourbon preferring the minty spiciness of rye but beer seems to love being aged in bourbon bbls in turn i love the aged beer finish was dry and boozy but that was okay by me since they copped to it on the label i just dislike getting blindsided

1101,Tynt Meadow,3.97,poured from 330ml bottle into a dimpled mug date on the bottle is 72724 so im going to assume thats a bestby date the label says its made in a place called coalville which  seems legit  appearance rich redbrown hue with plenty of haze and a finger of creamy tan foam with a bit of an amber cast looks good  smell quite sweet with a nutty caramelly and biscuity malt element i must say although it seems wellmade its not particularly catered to my taste  taste sweet caramelly perhaps even with a hint of toffee theres that biscuity finish which im not as much of a fan of this is definitely a sweet malty treat i like it although its not perfect  mouthfeel medium body with a good carbonation and a nice smooth creaminess actually the creaminess is more than good  its quite lovely indeed  overall i mean i generally dont like biscuity beers but this one holds most of that particular character in the aroma so ill give it a little bit of a pass a nice dessert beer
1102,Tynt Meadow,4,lots going on in this one hard to pick out all the flavors most of them are subtle nothing overwhelming but its definitely a malty beer with bread and caramel a slight feel of alcohol dark brown mediumhigh carbonation i would need another one to appreciate it better

1122,Terrible,4.42,poured from a bottle  appearance  grand frothy light brown head sits atop a dark pop body when held to the light the body has a red mahogany color to it with nice clarity head stays with the beer throughout the enjoyment of it and nice even lacing lines the glass  aroma  citrus fruits and sweet floral great quadruple smell  taste  no alcohol on the tongue belgian yeast and subdued sweet fruits complex smooth and enjoyable slight malty brown sugary thickness lingers in the back of the throat  mouthfeel  lighter than expected mild carbonation  overall  absolutely enjoyable beer to drink checks all the boxes in my opinion of a great quadruple

1126,Black Chocolate Stout,4.04,black in color with a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering three quarters of the top the aroma is of dark chocolate im tasting bitter dark chocolate dark malt and some piney hops the mouth is thick and sticky
1127,Black Chocolate Stout,4.75,excellent stout
1128,Black Chocolate Stout,3.85,allowed to acclimate to room temperature for 18 minutes and poured into a snifter  pours an incredibly dark brown with equally dark brown hints around the edges and a 15 finger dark tan head  initial aroma is a hint of black licorice followed by dutch processed cocoa powder i think theres some raisin in there i might get a tiny hint of smoke and oak but i might be hallucinating  initial taste is bold and powerful perhaps a small hint of licorice but otherwise just a big and slightly overwhelming experience to take a large sip its quickly followed by bitter dutch cocoa taste across the middle back and sides of the tongue in the middle and aftertaste i get some bitterness not from the chocolate but from the beer itself as well tasting it again after i realize that in the initial taste its the alcohol im tasting followed by the licorice then the cocoa and bitterness as i get through it i taste a little raspberry but only in the aftertaste and only when sipping very small amounts its a much welcomed note with the chocolate additionally as i get towards the end the alcohol becomes more noticable in both aroma and taste at the end i thought the alcohol tasted similar to that of vodka burn and made me think of hass avocado skin and the color olive drab i know that doesnt make sense sorry  the mouthfeel is nice not exactly velvet smooth but it is definitely smooth it glides over the tongue easily oily and slick in a good way if that makes sense  this is something i could imagine myself sipping slowly with my legs crossed wearing a nice jacket and having a discussion with someone in a nice living room  may buy again but not terribly likely overall a good beer that i enjoyed but did not adore and i think im satisfied with drinking once
1129,Black Chocolate Stout,3.97,this is a yearly purchase for me and its been interesting to note the slight variation with each release as always this is a great looking stout black with some brown edging tan head with decent retention getting some char molasses and fig in the aroma along with a dark chocolate backbone the taste surprised me however i can still remember the utter shock i had many many years ago when i found out that this beer does not actually contain chocolate it was an eyeopening experience to see what could be accomplished through malt selection and highlevel brewing technique this years release however has a super roasty almost burnt quality the chocolate also seems much more like a super dark bitter 85 cacao version rather than the smoother fudgier flavor im used to its alright on the way down but the finish  aftertaste are harsh a bit of a letdown compared to prior years but still decent
1130,Black Chocolate Stout,2.46,i didnt taste much chocolate quite bitter disappointing
1131,Black Chocolate Stout,4.15,ive been enjoying bbcs for over 20 years presented and promoted it for over a decade offered it in numerous beer tasting events on tap fresh and in vintage bottles but this is my 1st review here its changed over the years as will this one if stored properly new brown swirly label i dont care for  the classy image of the white on black is missing the pour results in a tall dark tan head of sticky foam with good persistence and specks of lace over a jet black liquid the aroma is big and sweet but not bold or overwhelming strong treacle and molasses notes mix with bakers chocolate dripped over warm oatmeal with a splash of tequila the flavor is busy  sharp black grain and long boil hop bitterness stab the tongue up front right along with the caramel malt sweetness that adds depth and complexity softer hints of drunken cherries and berries figs and rye bread all blend with the charred grain and sweet toffee stoutness body is big and alcohol doesnt hide well even in the deep warm stout flavors the finish is long and bitter grassy hops wet leather and black coffee still a winner but in a boring new packagelabel
1132,Black Chocolate Stout,4.3,walking through my local wegmans looking for a new imperial stout to try i remember reading the reviews about this one so i thought id pick it up im glad i did pours dark with a tan head very delicious and even better the closer it gets to room temperature definitely putting a few of these away to see what aging does to it
1133,Black Chocolate Stout,4.91,valhalla in a bottle
1134,Black Chocolate Stout,4.29,12 oz bottle bottled on winter 2019 consumed on 26 dec 2022 glass tulip snifter abv 10 serving temp room temp   look black with a 23finger high creamy dark tan to light brown head the head dissipates slowly leaving very good lacing  smell dark roasted malts with a touch of char rich semisweet dark chocolate mixed with some milk chocolate notes a touch of vanilla  taste all the aromas are here and dialed up a notch a black licorice or anise note joins the party about midsip this is followed by light smokey notes and a light touch of char and ash some molasses even sneaks in and perhaps a hint of a dark fruit a mild bitterness then arrives and helps to change the chocolate to a bittersweet variety the sip finishes lightly bitter a tad dry malty and lighltly chocolatey  feel creamy silky and viscous warmth from the alcohol can be felt the body is medium  overall a very nice russian imperial stout great aromas great flavors enjoyable and easy to drink i dont detect much bitterness which must be from the 3 years that i had this beer in the cellar
1135,Black Chocolate Stout,4.24,one of those beers that ive drank so many times over the years that im surprised i havent reviewed it 2022 vintage pours black with a brown head good retention and lacing smoke roast chocolate and dark fruit aroma burnt caramel dark chocolate and dried fruit heavy bodied but dry lower carbonation the one of the few imperial stouts you can rely on being there every year and not changing fwiw i once had a 14yo one that had been stored in a fridge and it tasted like ruby port and cocoa
1136,Saison Dupont,4.14,serving 750 ml bottle bottled on 01 24 23 poured into a 14 oz rastal teku glass  appearance hazy golden yellow with a rocky head of sudsy white bubbles and clumpy lace  smell straw hay black pepper cloves and slight banana on the nose  taste straw hop and yeast spice continue atop a clean malt base with subtle grain sweetness refined bitterness and a crisp dry finish  mouthfeel light body filled out by lively carbonation  overall at once refreshing and drinkable while also deeply complex and characterful

1138,Saison Dupont,3.92,pours a slightly cloudy dark golden color white fluffy head formation with good retention spicy banana on the nose fruity banana clover taste high carbonation mouthfeel great rendition of the style
1139,Saison Dupont,4.04,pours mid amber gold mildly cloudy with some floating sediment instant aroma of old wood clover and grass pure farm taste follows with rich oak and musty leather and barn full and delicious feel real character
1140,Saison Dupont,4.46,this is a unique and funky adventure hay barnass and worker sweat white pepper and spooky bottom this is one of take to a martian to taste i likee
1141,Saison Dupont,4.03,71523 on tap at apothecary alehouse in morgantown wv  beautiful head and lacing cloudy tan amber in color  aromas farmy fresh clover and barn malt  high carbonation clove definitely finished dry and spicy
1142,Saison Dupont,4.34,16oz undated can  pours clear gold with three inches of dense white head persistent retention with plenty of spongy lacing clove bubblegum apples wet hay in the nose light bodied with a soft but crisp mouthfeel earthy spice and belgian phenols on the palate with honeydrizzled biscuits underneath clovestudded apples and faint peppercorns finishes dry and spicy
1143,Saison Dupont,4.5,poured from a 330ml bottle   pours a lightish orange  clear with a thick white head that becomes a ring  the smell is full on belgian yeast and very mellow with it and the taste follows suit  that belgian yeast to the fore with a slight orange hint running through and a pleasant light bitterness from almost the beginning of every sip  everything is very well balanced the mouthfeel is good  mouth coating and creamy light carbonation overall this is a splendid beer  rich and mellow and rounded on every corner 
1144,Saison Dupont,4.21,pour is a lightly cloudy straw yellow with a dense cap of chalk white fluffy head great retention nose is straw hay lemony zest maybe hints of bananaclove taste follows the nose hay straw lightly grainy upfront followed by a quick hit of clove lemony zest hint of banana moderate bitterness very refreshing effervescent and crisp easy to drink
1145,Saison Dupont,4.19,poured from a pint can into two snifters  appearance honey golden cloudy per its unfiltered character with a oneinch head that gradually dissipated leaving moderate lacing  nose not unpleasant earthy alcohol a bit of citrus  mouthfeel medium with plenty of carbonation  attack follows the nose with the addition of malt thats between bread and biscuit  finish just enough hop bitterness to balance  this is the classic with good reason and its pairing near perfectly with our kaleandchicken salad highly recommended
1146,Aventinus Eisbock,4.49,fantastic doppelbock  pours out like liquid caramel dark caramel but thick and rich as i would imagine it would the smell is sweet and malty with just enough of the booze to let you know it will warm you up quickand boy does it mouthfeel though carbonated is thick and fullbodied which makes up for it great beer kinda off the style but a welcomed experience
1147,Aventinus Eisbock,4.44,dark copperyred body with a thick beige head the flavor is alcohol with malty sweetness and a hint of toffee the finish has some slight hoppiness with the cleanness of a lager if this isnt perfect its very close
1148,Aventinus Eisbock,4.37,medium brown cloudyhazy a bright brown a bit of a head that persists nutmeg caramel banana in the nose fruity full body smooth feel nothing off putting round smooth enjoyable sweet but not excessively well balanced long finish with nothing unpleasant very good
1149,Aventinus Eisbock,4.46,pours extremely dark brown dense offwhite head ok retention and lacing but im going to give the beer the benefit of the doubt and say that the glass wasnt washed as well as it could have been smells like a banana bread with raisins thats been soaked in spiced rum damn raisins bananas nut muffins caramels clove and a booziness that is warming and prominent but not harsh at all heavy bodied syrupy but not cloying low carbonation this is a good one for a christmas nightcap not something i could see drinking more than once a year and only on the coldest of nights
1150,Aventinus Eisbock,4.08,rich syrupy sweet very smooth delicious
1151,Aventinus Eisbock,4.32,pouts thick syrupy sweet taste dark cherries hints of buckwheat not an everyday beer strong beer had it with speckled seatrout and herbed biscuits what a combo
1152,Aventinus Eisbock,5,a dark brown pour with a dep red hue little to no head when poured  s aroma is very similar to the aventinus you can smell the hints of toffee and molasses  t very rich the flavors in this beer are concentrated as well as the ab you get a nice rich bock flavor along with a boozy finish this is seriously good  mf overall tis has a rich mouthfeel and a heavy body be sure to sip this one  o near prefect beer in m opinion the eisbock is a must try
1153,Rodenbach Alexander,4.65,look moderately hazy reddishbrown hue with a thick creamcolored head with just a hint of pinkish red fairly significant lacing and a very slow dissipation to the head  smell it has that red wineesque aroma that all of the truly great flanders red ales have theres a minor hint of fruit but the aroma is dominated by the ale itself  taste the excellent quality flanders red ale dominates upfront taste of malt oak red wine vinegar plus that distinctive flanders red taste that is hard to pin down in words the sour cherry starts to become apparent next with a lingering sweet cherry on the aftertaste the lingering sweet cherry is surprising and pushes right up to the edge of being too much like cough syrup but it never quite crosses the line and gives this a truly unique and distinctive taste both the sour and sweet cherry become more apparent as the beer warms  feel fairly highly carbonated light body overall  overall theres a reason this is a worldclass beer the ale itself is truly top notch but what pushes this over the edge is the unique blend of sour and sweet cherry that i have never encountered in any other beer ive tried
1154,Rodenbach Alexander,4.47,a 750ml corked and caged bottle poured into a tilquin stemmed glass  appearance a nice clear maroon red colour with a half finger beige head that dissipated fairly quickly white leaving only sparse lacing  aroma tart cherry strawberry oak with notes of vanilla and fruit vinegar  taste lightly sour sweet cherry strawberry oak and fruit vinegar  mouthfeel light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation  overall good enjoyable aroma and flavours that is balanced and very fruity my preference is still caract√®re rouge though
1155,Rodenbach Alexander,4.15,330 ml bottle poured into a tulip  l hazy redhued brown 2 finger pink head fizzy foam has moderate retention lively pour s nose is mild but pleasant light berry rainwater and spicy hop aromas t mediumhigh lactic sweetness no bitterness notes of red fruit cherriesberries hint of oak finishes sour with the sweetness drying quite a bit f light bodied smooth and slightly soft hardens a bit toward the finish no bite somewhat chewy o good never gets too sour for my palate and remains easy to drink seems similar to a fruit lambic
1156,Rodenbach Alexander,4.37,rodenbach alexander pours a reddishbrownish color with lots of bubbles and not much head the aroma is the tart cherry the flavor is big tart and prominent sweet cherry notes almost candylike that linger just a bit on the palate great feeling overall a sweeter flanders red with a tart kick lots of cherry flavors
1157,Rodenbach Alexander,4.42,poured from 330ml bottle into my beeradvocate teku  appearance rich amberruby hue with a clear body and a thin layer of frothy foam that is perhaps light tan with a hint of pink pretty  smell rich aroma with a hint of sourness and wonderful cherry character its just sweet enough to be very candylike im super duper into it  taste holy cow its even more candylike than the aroma the extra tartness in the flavor combined with the sweetness and cherry give almost a jolly rancher like character to this thing that said theres definitely malt underneath the candy is there such a thing as too much candy in a beer like this i am not sure but if there is this might be approaching it still  very good indeed  mouthfeel medium body with a nice carbonation and a good creaminess it comes together well  overall i mean this beer is definitely my speed i love cherry and i love flemish beers so really this ticks a lot of boxes for me its extremely good but i want to say its almost too much even for me so excellent if not transcendent
1158,Rodenbach Alexander,4.29,production date is difficult to decipher  october 2021 consumed on 12302022 poured from a 330ml bottle into my rodenbach flute  cloudy old rose body with auburn highlights and a lasting ivory collar and faint surface slick fine sandy lacing delicate legs  fruit forward aroma fairly vinous like fine aged balsamic with a hint of blood orange with a complex sweet graininess  intensely juicy palate entry suffused with pressed cherry juice orange blossom honey and an almost savory malt note light acidity more from fruit than lacto very little oxidation faint cocoa plum vanilla and rosewater medium finish with hints of apple and raspberry vague hops diacetyl and oak all complimentary to the malt base and ongoing fruit  creamy mediumbodied sufficiently carbonated  was expecting much more acidity and more tannins but this is nearly a dessert beer given the prominence of smooth almost artificialjolly rancher like fruit flavor
1159,Rodenbach Alexander,5,poured from 112ounce bottle into a champagne flute because it seemed like the right thing to do not much left to be desired with this one slightly hazy dark reddish orange with a bright reddishorange highlight and a pinkish head that settled to a beautiful ring tart funky and fruity with a cherry jolly rancher thing going on medium bodied with a slightly oaky finish with lingering notes of tart cherry overall it just doesnt get much better than this highly recommended
1160,Rodenbach Alexander,4.68,i really like the rodenbach caract√®re rouge so i thought id give the rodenbach alexander a try  look  looks a lot like the caract√®re rouge with just a bit more head a beautiful clear amber red with a head that doesnt last very long  smell  a nice cherry scent that isnt overly sour also oak and flanders funk this smells really nice  taste  the taste is very much like the smell not sour at all in fact this is the first sour that i think could use just a bit more sourness though i much prefer this to overly sour sours a bit dry but very good  feel  a nice carbonation very easy to drink  overall  this is another great beer from rodenbach im generally not a huge fan of this style of beer because its usually too sour for my liking but this one is nice
1161,Rodenbach Alexander,4.5,murky reddish brown with a little fast fading head  smells of musky oak apple cider vinegar dusty cellar and balsamic  the taste follows the nose but is a balance of puckering sour and sweetness cherries are in there as well  thick and acidic somewhat woody texture with moderate to low carbonation  i got this a long time ago somewhere in north america probably the usa likely california brought it to phuket with me over 18 months ago where im drinking during our second covid quarantine june 21st 2022 great brew survived a lot but not this time of isolation
1162,Rodenbach Alexander,4.49,cloudy sark redbrowncranberry appearance plenty of effervescent champagne like carbonation with maybe just a hair above average body aroma is fresh black cherriescherry juicered winevinegarwoodearthy bread flavor is sweeter than expected but definitely is sour along with tartness and a little funk similar to aroma but its dryer than expected but very pleasant overall this is an excellent top notch beer that even if you dont like sour beer this might still be enjoyable
1163,Rodenbach Alexander,4.28,750ml bottle into a teku bottled 91419 so over 2 12 years old  body looks good clear dark red wine color smally bubbly head disappears quickly  decent sour aroma with some cherry and oak notes  delightful tasting beer sweet tart  sour notes mesh beautifully faint oak notes sour cherry a bit more prominent  mouth medium finish lightly sour and a touch drying  overall nicely crafted and quite easy drinking great balance between sweet and sour tartness more pronounced
1164,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.53,112oz bottle best by march 2024 served in a shaker pint glass  appearance clear pale gold thin white head with fine sheets of lacing  smell mostly clean with a bit of sulfurskunky note  taste clean breadyslightly sweet middle with some noble hop bite at the finish  mouthfeel ok thickness a bit fizzy but not badly so  overall  drinkability about what you would expect from a euro pale lager no frills has that skunky note but is easily drinkable it did pair well with my pasticio and greek salad
1165,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.27,enjoyed at a local greek restaurant in ft myers fl green bottle poured in glass very flavorful with just enough carbonation
1166,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.75,bottle pour into a tulip glass clear pale golden appearance with a modest foamy head that recedes quickly to a surface film and collar grain scallion celery pepper herb anise notes light body light carbonation soft lively mouthfeel
1167,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.21,poured from a 330ml bottle  pours dark yellow with a tiny and fleeting head  smelling of grass with a touch of skunk  the taste is light grassy and mildly sweet with a slight bitterness mouthfeel is okay  neither good nor bad  overall average but on a hot day would do to cool you down  average
1168,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,2.92,new review because i was drunk last time cool unicorn on the label  extra overall marks for the bottle cap perfect if you are heading for the field school or a war zone like me but it looks totally average inside a glass great smooth head though  aroma is a little unique in terms of the hopsdefinitely different from a western european pilsner kind of musky and spicy  mega unified hops and malt subtle sweet hops i love it hops are beautiful so is the malt quite a complex mouth feel with a taste that gradually gets more bitter as it swirls around crisp and dry yet still complex definitely tastes best out of the bottle in hot weather in general for me greek food products are the most pure and natural of any country cyprus too the tomatoes and salad in cyprus are simply amazing  this tastes much much better straight out of the bottle try    if you want a similar beer that is like this but better try efes pilsner dont try the efes draft or malt they are terrible  sorry i dont want to restart any wars but its just beer
1169,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,2.69,green bottle poured into a glass  clear golden liquid occasional carbonation streams  frothy white layer reduces to spotty lacings and a ring  slight grassy aroma  thin lightly flavored lager  grassy  slight sweetness  fizzy mouthfeel fair beer
1170,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,2,a very weak lager from greece nothing exciting here granted it would be a nice accompaniment to some good greek food low carbonization and crispness make it drinkable
1171,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.62,i had a bottle of this with dinner at a local greek restaurant with dinner went really well with pastitcio
1172,Coors Light,2.73,refreshing summer classic not even my wifes bazoongas can bring me as much joy as the sight of blue mountains beckoning me to take another delicious swig of colorados finest brewed liquid
1173,Coors Light,2.67,from a can best by 91123 clear golden color with an inch of foamy white head sweet grain aroma light body with prickly carbonation grain and corn with a bit of a floral note on the finish an ok beer crisp and refreshing but not much going on the advertising is not wrong  you dont want to let this beer warm up its best right out of the fridge
1174,Coors Light,2.88,better than water
1175,Coors Light,2.36,look pale yellow and crystal clear with a sudsy white head that builds to the rim and quickly and noisily settles to a film leaving minimal lacing behind aroma corn straw cereal grains and muted but slightly detectable floral hop notes honestly there isnt much going on here taste starts out with cereal grains and straw but with a watered down taste to it before wafts of spotty floral hop notes peek in occasionally corn comes on in the second act and lingers before grains and water close it out mouthfeel light and watery clean mediumhigh carbonation and a clean and crisp finish overall what can i say  its coors light the watered down sibling of the banquet beer is exactly that and doesnt bring much to the table aroma nor tastewise although refreshing on a hot day when your thirsty i would and do pick a ton of nonlight aals over this when the occasion calls
1176,Coors Light,1.1,what do this beer and having sex in a boat have in common  theyre both fking close to water
1177,Coors Light,3.1,i enjoy this beer
1178,Coors Light,2.08,not the worst option out there
1179,Coors Light,2.07,its beer at least

1181,Le Terroir,4.29,look  clear copper with non stop bubbles with a nice last white head with a really thick rimming and great lacing smell  earthy tart lemon orange taste  tart but not overly tart with a citrus lemon orange and still a slight grainy earthy slight floral feel  creamy medium full body with a very light carb overall  really tasty beer overall  really tasty even after being aged
1182,Le Terroir,4.94,this is a superb beer probably the best beer ive ever drank the balance is perfect with superb complexity and depth the initial sour notes fade to a rich full sweet centre finishing clean and sour

1184,Le Terroir,4.43,while ive had 73 ales in this style i understate the situation and say that i am no fan for wilds of the first 200 wilds listed by their number of ratings ive had 22 and only 1 did i rate above the average  le terroir is the second  since i am such a sourpuss i should like sour ales only rarely is that pairing made  but this review is supposed to be about le terroir it looks better than the competition who often look confused and few are foamy terroir smells like tart fruit and it tastes that way yet its sweet and sour combo has this rare drying sensation that continues best yet it does not interfere with my meal of soup and spinach too many wilds overpower terroir stays within itself and treats food as a friend  i suppose that comes from hiring rodenbachs brewmaster and the mark he left ive made my microreview of new belgium elsewhere and admire the founders who cut their workers into the deal who in turn sold the company to a big brand manager i hope they made the right decision and the creativity of le terroir continues  this is my second addition to purposefully climbing beer of fame now  163 a votre sante 
1185,Blonde Ale,2.26,date august 12 2021 occasion sweating out a thursday night with a newish gf beer glasseware liberty inverted pint this sizzles while pouring out the can but its head fizzles from a white twofingered coral that stars in its own disappearing act its sallow golden body approximates apple juice speaking of which the aroma is apple cracker malts sweet oats light citrus and some odd yeasts not quite alluring its mouthfeel is light oily refreshing enough with the finish agreeable if not fleeting the flavor profile is soft if not repressedapple noble hops lemon cereal oats and some funky yeasts leave this light and refreshing but not quite a fullyformed blonde this does come with a great caveat glutenfree makes this a possible goto on warm summer night such as this
1186,Blonde Ale,2.41,crystal clear light gold color decent starting head but it fades to rim bubbles and leaves absolutely no lace after five minutes even the rim bubbles are gone there is however a steady stream of upward bubbles throughout the tasting  thin and weak aroma dry almost a apple ciderlike nose  initially i pick up on more apples lightly sour lightly sweet no notable hop the body is very thinlike a macro the carbonation is high but not like soda pop the finish is flat and sour short aftertaste overall its not as bad as the rating i saw before the tasting but its not that good either
1187,Blonde Ale,3.43,clear light gold color with small white cap  sweetish grain aroma with a slightly floral character  very rounded flavor of clean grain with a touch of sweetness similar to aals without rough edges simple grain taste with a minimum hop influence that finishes quick and clean  medium texture with balancing carbonation   i dont understand the low reviews on this one unless there are some production problems my example was clean and straight forward with a pleasant if unassuming character
1188,Blonde Ale,3.5,l very effervescent as streams of bubbles race to the surface it is bright gold with a thin but persistent ivory foam collar  s aromas feature sorghum earthiness and orange peel with some hop citrus  t it starts prickley with orange and sorghum and some earthiness the orange peel masks some of the sharp sorghum flavors and softens it  f medium light body and high carbonation  o the beer is a little cidery and the sorghum earthiness comes across as a little musty especially in the aftertaste
1189,Blonde Ale,2.4,wtf a bottled beer from woodychandler this is a rarity poured from a brown 12 oz bottle has a golden color with a 12 inch head and lots of carbonation smell is of sorghum green apples taste is strong of sorghum cough medicine green apples yucky yuck feels light in the mouth and overall thank god i am not gluten free
1190,Blonde Ale,2.7,it would be interesting for those guys that drink a lot of modelo it a session beer for the summer
1191,Blonde Ale,2.27,12oz bottle  ok back to the sorghum and brown rice extract method of removing gluten from the beer equation  gulp  this beer pours a clear medium golden amber colour with two fingers of puffy loosely foamy and mostly fizzy offwhite head which leaves a few minor instances of sea plume lace around the glass as it quickly sinks out of sight  it smells like apple or white wine vinegar mixed with rubbing alcohol with a heady dose of freerange berry sugar tossed right in and an acrid vegetal graininess my old nemesis sorghum right back out of cletus back 40 again it would seem the taste is sweet musty and kind of thin apple cider more unpleasantly vegetal maltiness some stricken earthy yeast cheap dark sugar notes and a hollow attempt at weedy and floral hop bitterness  the carbonation is fairly light in its incessant and pandering fizziness the body on the wan side of the barest middleweight and not really all that smooth as the tart and pithy fruity nature doesnt lean that way it finishes offdry that stale apple cider thing still a real going concern while the other goings on are of no concern  yup the divide between the two processes for arriving at glutenfree or reduced i get it beer ever widens i cant really tell apart all the alternative grain offerings especially from this brewery as they are all pretty much a variation on what ive detailed here oh and i just noticed that new planet is from freaking boulder colorado how have they not yet been run out of town or at the very least um better educated
1192,Blonde Ale,1.08,theres nothing wrong with the look of this beer but thats where the positives end theres only six listed ingredients so i dont know what makes it taste so bad ive tried all three of the omission beers which are gluten free just like this one and the omissions are good so it cant be the gluten free factor that makes this one so bad its overwhelmingly citrus at first and the aftertaste is just horrid luckily i bought this in a mixersixer so i didnt have to stomach more than one
1193,Blonde Ale,2.48,i had a colleague who is glutenfree and i told her that i would keep my eye out for gf beer options and report back to her on my findings in the interim i retired from that job and i still have the beers awaiting review i have not felt perfect these last couple of days so i thought that i would try somethings fairly innocuous  from the bottle refreshingly smooth gluten free ale made from sorghum and corn extract for every new plane beer you enjoy a portion of the proceeds is donated to help our planet  geez louise no sooner had i begun to pop the cap than i got a bunch of foam coming up through the neck i placed the bottle in the awaiting glass and waited for it to calm down before proceeding can you say gentle pour boys and girls it acted like soda pop creating threeplus fingers of fizzy foamy bonewhite head that burbled popped and fizzled its way out of existence color was strawyellow srm   2  4 with neplus quality clarity nose had an apple vinegarlike sharpness and i have noted this before in other gf beers mouthfeel was thin kind of watery the taste had a tart applelike flavor which while not great was drinkable finish was semidry with an applelike flavor that seemed to linger i am not sure how i feel about this one as i have other tests to conduct it was reasonable especially when you consider the narrow bandwidth of the glutenfree style
1194,Blonde Ale,2.34,poured a light gold color with an airy looking white head no residual lacing smell some hops citrus and some bread very cider like taste and feels much like a cider with a carbonated light feel taste is light and not much too it definitely tastes like rubbing alcohol smells
1195,Blonde Ale,1.15,as a long time celiac sufferer ive kept up a long search for a decent good gf beer is like a white rhino gf beer new planet would be out of business if there were many good options this ale  is as undrinkable as the rest of the beers produced by new planet ill drink anything tolerable as there arent many options but this stuff tastes like you sucked on a dirty penny and then provides an aftertaste that lingers on your palate and makes the experience even worse their other beers are horrible as well but this is the worst of the worst do not waste your money or time with this brewery id rate it a 0 overall if it was an option
1196,Blonde Ale,1,
1197,Blonde Ale,1.1,
1198,Tucher Festbier,3.92,on tap a moderately hazy pour into a shaker glass didnt have a lot of head but decent surface coverage was maintained honey lemon tea malt notes greet my nose as i close in on said glass with a light bit of toasted bread melanoidin taste is surprisingly more clean and bitter in comparison the honey malt is noticeable but a somewhat piney  lemongrassy bitterness pairs with it and grabs more attention as each sip evolves similar to other festbiers ive had the bitter and malt notes play together a little better as the beer gets warmer or my palate adjusts improving the overall experience
1199,Tucher Festbier,3.74,there was a strong hops aroma as soon as i opened the can it started out with two fingers of white creamy head but settled to a thin white layer about halfway through the glass carbonation is light compared to most lagers the body is a little heavy and a little sweet but it is well balanced by hops this is very decent festbier at a very reasonable price the rating of very good is accurate
1200,Tucher Festbier,4.07,169 oz can filled may 12 2023 into a tall lager glass l pours clear light gold with a thin creamy white head that recedes to a thick skin large steady carbonation bubbles mediumlight lacing banding  spots s malty grains light fruits a hint of bread dough t gently bright fruity hops caramelized malts somewhat rich a hint of apple it is lightly sweet with a fruity bite at the top of each drink f brisk bright mediumfull body with a smooth middle and a fast clean lightly drying finish it is gently sticky o bright malty and very easy to drink has a zippy feel and a clean finish very well balanced taste and feel it is excellent in its style
1201,Tucher Festbier,4.17,from a 500ml can brewed 51223 clear amber color with a finger of foamy white head bready aroma with some floral hops medium body with good carbonation rich malty flavor with a herbal finish first time seeing this and i would get it again
1202,Tucher Festbier,4.13,a pours a beautifully clear pale goldenyellow color a dense white head rises to over two fingers excellent retention and plenty of lace left behind as it gently recedes s pale malts are the show baked sourdough bread biscuits and honey this is like walking into a bakery just a touch of earthy hops t love the pales malts again baked bread biscuits and honey a bit of an apple cider character just enough herbal and grassy hops to make a presence without any real bitterness added mo a medium to full body wonderful carbonation that is at first crisp but becomes ultra fine and silky smooth with the apple cider like character it does finish a bit sweeter than i would like though that is a small gripe and can drink this all day in big gulps  this seems like a great traditional festbeir to me with lots of character i hope to see this more often i think this is the first time i have noticed this on the shelves near me ill be getting a lot more
1203,Tucher Festbier,3.8,a very good light beer that i would recommend for any one wanted to try german style lagers for the first time its very smooth and crisp and not too over dramatically away from traditional american lagers but he just enough flavor to venture out into the craft beer world

1205,Tucher Festbier,4.45,good beer really full albeit subtle and nuanced malty and warm but presents a lot of classic rustic germanic hop character i could imagine having several just as much as one can do the trick really happy to have come across it and it reminds me quite firmly of tuchers helles which is wonderful as well

1210,Everett,4.8,draught basically the perfect porter brown nitroesque head perfect sweetness
1211,Everett,4.47,canned 122022  so here we are the highest rated american porter on ba the legendary hill farmstead everett this is awesome to finally get my hands on a long time want of mine not to mention i get the pleasure of trying this just 3 days after canning lets crack it open and find out what all the hype is about  pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of dark tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  oh yeah the nose displays such a wonderful balance between roast and sweetness i love it im picking up on aromas of medium roast coffee milk chocolate brown sugar earthy hops raisin dark toast light toffee vanilla and black pepper  it really upholds the aroma in taste though maybe a tad less sweet on the front end of the sip im tasting drip coffee dark bread brown sugar honey milk chocolate raisin vanilla light caramel and earthy hops the swallow brings notes of milk chocolate molasses medium roast coffee brown sugar raisin dark toast vanilla toffee and earthy hops  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick yet sharp beer finishes bone dry and roasty  this is everything i was hoping it would be wonderfully balanced and smooth yet drinks well under its abv im so glad i ended up getting 8 of these
1212,Everett,3.63,thanks to roy_hobbs for this one from his strike during nbs bif 15 16oz can dated 51821 poured into 16oz tulip poured the expected dense nearly solid black color with about an inch of tan head head that had decent retention and lacing  the aroma had a solid but not overpowering amount of roast at the front of the nose backed with solid grains and just a bit of floral hops  similar on the tongue a good blend of grain roast and soft slightly grassy hops  the body was also about typical for the style perhaps a touch fuller than usual smooth and had a dry roasty finish that lingered  drinkability was very good a nice sipper and an easy quaffer at the same time  overall a very nicely done brew a musttry if you get the chance
1213,Chocolate Rain,4.5,750ml bottle at share 2015 vintage near black pour small beig e head fades away aroma is roasty dark chocolate boozy with light fruity accents taste drops in raisins and prunes on top of the sweet roasty malts full and creamy pretty damn warm too everything i have heard about this beer is true a real classic that has aged well
1214,Chocolate Rain,4.08,2021 vintage 202 abv
1215,Chocolate Rain,4.07,this one pours a surprisingly thin dark brown that emits a fair amount of light around its edges brief cola fizz with no head retention or lacing nose has a leathery molasses and salty licorice black tuesday backbone melded with semisweet chocolate chips some vanilla and oak as well nothing overpowering and all the aromas feel like theyre integrated into the beer rather than an adjunct or flavoring thats thrown in on top and feels artificial taste follows  it lacks the overpowering leathery and brackish boldish of black tuesday but the cocoa additional doesnt tilt this sweet instead it takes some of the rougher edges off bt while still maintaining an overall savory or at least no sweet stout lots of alcohol barrel and bourbon spice lingers nicely on the loooong finish plenty of heat as well but again not overpowering i do find the feel a little thing similar to gray monday but not everything needs the chew of bcbs i still prefer bt but this is a fine variant
1216,Chocolate Rain,3.8,2017 vintage  its been a while but im back with another bif beer from eziel this guy supplied me with some truly crazy stuff and im hyped to try this one out i really liked the raspberry cobbler black tuesday variant so i have high hopes for this one too lets dive into it  pours a surprisingly light muddy brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to nothing and leaves no lacing  the nose here is quite pungent perhaps an artifact of 5 year old vanilla beans and cacao nibs im picking up on aromas of cocoa powder raisin dark chocolate vanilla bean heavily roasted coffee hot bourbon light toasted oak and molasses  whereas the nose was charmingly pungent the taste is a bit sharp and aggressive on the front end of the sip im tasting hot bourbon burnt coffee vanilla bean dark chocolate caramel brown sugar and molasses the swallow brings notes of hot bourbon toasted oak vanilla bean cacao nibs black cherry burnt coffee toasted oak and caramel  a full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a sharp and boozy duh beer finishes dry but with a serious alcoholic heat  damn i dont know if it was the age but i really did not vibe with this one its hard to say if it was once well constructed as it doesnt even really show a shell of what it used to be save for the aroma hopefully the black tuesday reserve he sent me is much better
1217,Chocolate Rain,4.57,drinking a 2013 in 2022 look  black and thick no real head smell  chocolate vanilla caramel booze taste  boozy chocolate vanilla caramel lots of barrel feel  full body very very light carb overall  not bad for being 9 years old
1218,Chocolate Rain,4.9,tummy
1219,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4,169oz bottled best by 9724 opened 91023 thin tan head with limited staying power falls to a ring and island quickly and hangs there opaque body at the core with dark brown at the edge no lace rich roasty malt aroma with dark fruit earthy coffee wet wood and spice lots of fruit flavors unclear if its a byproduct of the coffee or yeast malt booze or some other component coffee shows best after 30 minutes or so of warming up booze is present but almost an afterthought amidst the cacaphony of fruit and coffee flavors medium plus body with some prickly heat smoother mouthfeel as it warms lengthy flavorful finish with a bit of sweetness very good
1220,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.8,pours a dark opaque brown black with a small brown head the aroma is coffee bourbon and roasty malts flavor is dark fruits brown sugar roasted malt and coffee medium full bodied and a little acidic finishes clean with a little tingling on the tongue either from the ph or the alcohol very good easy drinking
1221,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.24,aroma is bourbon coffee chocolate dark malts and slightly earthy the flavor is fruitdark fruit chocolate mild coffee and an acidic dark maltwarming bourbon alcohol finish
1222,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.84,this is the 2022 vintage with burundian turihamwe coffee blend from intelligentsia poured from the 169 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass  look the beer is a pure opaque black with no light coming through topped with a creamy finger thick head with ok retention this is a real imperial looking stout  smell creamy aroma of mocha and fresh espresso deep chocolate notes throughout not as much bourbon as in the original variant on first glance which may be a good thing this is inviting dark fruits somewhere within as the beer warms more of the bourbon and woody noes come out a bit vanilla makes an appearance as well as this warms and a slight spice  taste chocolatey up front with notes of mocha in between roasted and toasted malt some vanilla quickly covered up by bourbon which is immediately more evident than in the aroma brown sugar creme caramel surprising that this beer retains a sweeter than expected character throughout finishes with just as touch of bourbon underneath a really smooth almost fruity and spicy coffee note again not as heavy handed with the bourbon which is definitely there but much more nuanced  feel creamy with light carbonation coating finishes smooth with just a hint of tingling alcohol at the very end  overall oh yeah this is a good one i love that it doesnt try to hammer you over the head with the bourbon flavor instead it slowly brings you in with a wide variety of flavors the spotlight here is the turihamwe coffee blend which really makes a difference in the flavor profile that shows in the end product a premium product for sure but it lives up to expectations revealing something new at every sip a special experience that will probably show up in my top 10
1223,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.89,2022 vintage  poured from a 169 ounce bottle into a snifter  look black medium brown frothy head plentiful visible particulate at margins average head retention and lacing  smell coffee cacao bourbon oak cherry high strength of scent  taste bourbon coffee cacao oak high strength of flavor  feel between medium and full bodied moderately mouth coating average carbonation highly mouth warming high bitterness smooth  overall black with plentiful visible particulate at the margins strong bouquet of coffee cacao and bourbon vibrant flavors of bourbon coffee cacao and oak body was between medium and full with high mouth warming properties dynamic flavors and bouquet made for a fantastic drinking experience
1224,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.75,feel like ive been reading about this beer for so long and when i was recently at haymarket bridgman it happened to be on tap lived up to the hype great barrel character lot of chocolate and bursting with berries glad i was finally able to try it
1225,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.24,12 ounce can into a snifter canned 11822 had 9322  pours near black and opaque oily looking with a brief head and a little oily lacing aromas of bourbon roasted malt raspberries vanilla some oak and char flavors of bourbon raspberries roasted malt vanilla light oak smooth a little creamy a very good full body appropriately carbonated  very enjoyable the raspberries show well theres a nice roasted base and the barrels are lighter but good have had this on draft and at events over the years and this wasnt quite as good a  r033115 0450
1226,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.03,2022 version poured from a 12oz can into a snifter im not typically a big fan of fruit stouts but id heard good things about this beer and it didnt disappoint lightly tart fruit
1227,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.53,untappd backlog from 10122019
1228,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.04,the last thing i expected to be at fobab was an old whale i never thought i would tick but here we are and im so happy  despite all that i can settle myself and dig in as i do here in this 8 ball black short mocha headed ale i get chocolate raspberry sticks and not a ton of barrel theres just a little bite of slightly herbal wood which i think more than anything helps to bring us to a powder dry finish  i can see how this would have made the news in its heyday see what i did there but in todays world of absolute confections and bombastic feats of oak its quite underwhelming
1229,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.43,can courtesy of johnnyhops
1230,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.36,part of the wonderful deluge of midwest goodies sent my way by fbarber during nbs bif 13  gorgeous pour body traps light completely dark lovely finger of soft dark brown foam quite the beaut  nose has lovely rich velvety espresso with vanilla and milk chocolate and sure enough theres a hint of raspberries layered in there as well inviting  the berries are much more prevalent here beginning at the first sip it starts off as just kind of a general berryfruit sweetness that builds alongside the other components i will get to in a moment to reveal a jammy decidedly raspberry note well come back to this later the build alongside this has silky espresso and dark chocolate as well as a hint of vanilla and spice and oak from the barrel this brings us back to the raspberry you know how raspberries are actually kind of tart alongside their juicy sweetness its one of the great things about them is they offer a balance and a range of experience and that presents here the finish has some bitter from the coffee and a bit of pucker that feels like the raspberry tartness joining the oakiness of the barrels and a bit of alcohol astringency that works well in this situation to accentuate the other flavours listed there to give it a little ooh to the finish really enjoyable  body is velvety smoothe and that tart finish i descibe above fades to leave behind some of the dark chocolate bitterness and a slight reminder of the alcohol contained therein would not descibe it as hot but it isnt shy about its double digit abv  im really enjoying this raspberry and chocolate are such a natural seeming pairing but i feel like i still dont see it quite as often as id expect in beer i think it really really works well here and am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it thanks frank
1231,Munsterfest,3.82,pours a clear copper color with a nice head and lacing aroma has bready and malt hints taste has bready and malt flavors a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a decent marzen
1232,Munsterfest,4.15,bottle no visible date sam adams pint  a pours a quite dark crystalclear copperorangeamber one finger white head recedes to a splotchy thin skim of foam little visible carbonation heard dissipated faster than id like  s recovering from a cold and straight from the fridge get a little cherry tootsie pop malt sweetness with that dried fruitiness mixed in very much like the sweeter marzens and barleywines ive had toasty rich malt as it warms right to style for a marzen i think  t interestingly the malt complexity and fruitiness are there on the palate but the sweetness isnt somehow manages to have a rich complex toasty malty flavor without being too sweet toward the end the combination of malt fruit and noble hops makes it seem cloying but it really isnt this is an enigmatic marzen in being sweet without sweetness finishes quite clean goes right up to the line of being cloying without crossing it  m heavier side of medium finish is not entirely clean a little slick very low carbonation could be a touch cleaner but superb  o my favorite marzenfestbier straddle the line between the oldfashioned and modern styles this is clearly in the oldfashioned marzen category but is almost perfectly executed the head fell fast and it says a touch undercarbonated in my opinion my only qualms with this beer that would stop me from buying more are the things i dislike about the style 3f did a great job even though i wouldnt buy this again i tend to grade hardest on the styles i like the most and i like this style so take that for what it is
1233,Munsterfest,3.61,pours clear amberorange into my guinness glass thick head that settles to 14 inch  smells like shampoo sorry but it does  tastes well balanced definitely hopforward but not overpowering and none of that irritating citrusy hops more like a dirt hops in a good way malty follows in the end hoppier than i like but thats preference not complaint  feels good a little sharp bite on the swallow the carbonation seems to happen on the aftertaste  overall not my fave m√§rzen too hopheavy for my taste well done for what they were probably aiming for
1234,Munsterfest,3.5,its a solid enough offering but im not super impressed the bready flavor is a tad muted for me and it also comes off a bit stale idk id definitely revisit this beer but its not what id prefer
1235,Munsterfest,4,l  very deep orangeamber with a finger and a half of oatmeal colored head that sustains enough to leave nice lacing s  toasted grains are the dominant aroma excellent restraint with just a little noble hop earthiness taste consistent with the nose and true to the style f  medium heavy like al dente pasta continuing the classicalness o  pays homage to the style sometimes it is ok to not be not normal
1236,Munsterfest,3.79,12oz bottle no dating information found clear medium amber colored body two fingers of putty colored head and this lasts into the session with a high ring leaves behind broken strings of lacing aroma is dark bread malty and floral hops taste is sweet and malty dark and sour bread ends with some floral and fruity flavors of fig pear and apple smooth and silky mouth feel some crispness in the finish lower carbonation really quiet in the mouth but pretty in appearance
1237,Munsterfest,4.65,bottled 71823  give me more tasty german malts fff  lower carb is different for me as other describe  kinda raw tasting  wish i could find it on draft in cleveland
1238,Munsterfest,3.83,12oz bottle purchased from the fridge as a single for 199 bottled 072122 is etched on the glass so that makes this beer just over 4 months old  look pours an almost clear light to medium copper color initially there was a decent khakicolored head but it reduced to just a ring around the rim of the glass and a very thin glacier atop the surface the beer appeared to be perfectly clear until pouring the last few ounces after pouring the entire bottle into the glass this beer has a mild soft haze to it  smell maltforward with notes of spice apple orchards caramel and toffee it has a nice rustic bready aroma peppery notes also  taste it is balanced and pretty drinkable up front it has nice bread crust flavors along with some caramel and apple flavors the finish is very crisp and has a spicy bite to it with a touch of bitterness the finish especially reminds me of applecinnamon and ginger herbal tea almost if this didnt have all of the spicy notes on the finish this would remind me of a jw lees harvest ale its good just tastes like its missing something though  feel the body on this beer is a bit thin in my opinion for being a marzen and 62 abv it also feels like it is slightly undercarbonated  overall im pretty sure that this is my first lager from 3 floyds its a solid marzen offering from an american brewery i have had better and i have had worse granted i am reviewing this beer at 4 months old however i dont think that it has suffered much due to age i would try this again but probably only as a single
1239,Munsterfest,4.35,i normally think 3 floyds beers are a bit too hoppy for me though i do end up enjoying them my preferred taste tends towards malty beers and i was pleasantly surprised to find that here in this marzen by them  i love the mothfeel very low carbonation the beautiful orange color and the drinkable maltiness of this refreshing beer so glad i tried it on tap the bartender made me try it first because everyone was hating it for shame i loved it
1240,Light Beer,1,tastes like battery acid
1241,Light Beer,2.43,first off i dont like any light beers im a guinness stout guy however ill concede theres times when a heavier brew isnt the thirst quencher of choice like when the temp soars in the nineties and you would just about drink water as your preferred thirst quencher thats is a time for light beer and this ones is about as unoffensive as it gets it reminds me of keystone for those timesat an even better price its really light tasting not too much adjunct taste or hops bitterness it really quinces a thirst its easy to drink period for a basement priced brew for those who want to quaff it down this stuff rules i think it gets no love first because of the segment and second because of the price really what are we reviewing here for the segment it competes in and at the price it goes for this is a singularly good product i know its like the third or whatever generation of kirklands offerings in the light beer segment i think its good enough that they should settle on this on and offer it indefinitely
1242,Light Beer,2.6,ive rated every quality of this low and yet the overall score is a 35 why because for a measly 22 you can get 48 of these bad boys 48 at least where i live youll pay 21 for 24 coors an equally shitty beer in my opinion for its purpose you wont find a better deal and thats its appeal yellow color hardly any taste no head yet 44 will get an entire college party popping you know what youre getting and to the end this is great
1243,Light Beer,1.18,it was water not beer it is a shame they even put the word beer on the can
1244,Light Beer,2.68,a pours a crystal clear pale yellow in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and faint pale golden yellow colored highlights the beer has a finger tall fizzy bright white head that quickly reduces to a small patch of very thin film and a very thin ring at the edges of the glass minimal amounts of lacing are observed  s moderate aromas of grainy malts with moderate amounts of corn adjunct sweetness and just a hint of grassy hops  t upfront there are just shy of moderate flavors of grainy malts with moderate amounts of rice  corn adjuncts along with a light amount of corn sweetness that is followed by very light flavors of grassy hops which contribute a light to moderate amount of lingering bitterness  m light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation crisp  o while not a style that i generally seek out this beer was not offensive like some of the other budget offerings in the style easy to drink with a crisp light mouthfeel and well hidden alcohol i would not go out of my way to seek this out again but i was pleasant surprised  note this was received in thanks from a total stranger in the costco parking lot for helping him to load a couple of adirondack chairs into his vehicle
1245,Light Beer,1.44,oof you have no idea how badly i wanted this beer to be good at about 40 cents per can i had the highest hopes for this beer to be a crisp and refreshing one instead i am greeted on the nose with an oddly sweet and undeniably moscatolike smell the taste retains this sweetness but brings in quite a bit of funk as well this beer is just too flavorful to be a beer for getting drunk with nothing to enjoy about it in the first place very bad beer
1246,Light Beer,2.7,when i drink light beer i usually drink miller lite its not like it has a great flavor its just what i drink when it goes on sale at rite aid for under a buck a can when i saw this at costco for 50 a can i thought id give it a shot well its not really as good as miller lite you know how in restaurants when you order a soda water they bring it to you with a slice of lime this beer tastes exactly like that a lime citrus taste its not unpleasant and is probably really nice on a hot day after hours of backbreaking work it has the same alcohol content as miller lite at half the price but double the carbs and half the taste
1247,Light Beer,1.92,this is an alright college beer that i wouldnt recommend you buy  you absolutely cannot beat the price for these but they taste worse than pretty much any light or ice beer ive ever had  stick with pbr
1248,Light Beer,3,123117 can
1249,Light Beer,2.67,well it is christmas time and travels with family figured i needed to try this very similar to a busch light where was this in college at 21 for 48 beers
1250,Light Beer,1.06,the alcohol content is lower than any beer i have ever purchased personally but the most important thing to comment on is the subpar disgustingly flat taste in this fermented water the taste or headache isnt quite as bad as bud light but it gets close i just find it disappointing that such a large company would choose such a low grade beer to put their label on if it was closer in taste to say pabst blue ribbon or even as low as coors light id give 5 stars across board but its not even close on the plus side the price for the quantity is unbeatable and i will most likely continue to purchase this beer and its hangovers because of this as well as how good the company treats its customers
1251,Light Beer,2.03,this is my favorite light lager it has a mildly enjoyable caramel flavor but no head retention smell or real body regardless of price point its better than bud light coors light etc considering the price point wow my buddy and i went to costco the other day and saw these 997 for 48 yep we did a double take too and then we bought three what a deal
1252,Light Beer,1.65,this is the second try it said new taste and while it is less fruity it is even more watered down very poor im sad i have 47 more
1253,Dark O' The Moon,3.99,whoa this is a full flavored pumpkin stout chocolate cinnamon and rich malts theres a lot going on here and is certainly not a boring stout its tough to know what to rate this its busy not exceedingly busy and a unique take on a pumpkin stout thats not going to blend in
1254,Dark O' The Moon,4.12,pours black as midnight with thin tan head that recedes to a ring no lacing pumpkin dominates the smell and taste followed by cinnamon then faint chocolate and dark roasted grains tends toward bitter rather than a sweet stout a tad less cinnamon would be better but in the universe of pumpkin beers this take on a stout is quite interesting
1255,Dark O' The Moon,3.71,very thick smell of spices fudge and pumpkin bar the body falls somewhat behind on that promise providing a generic taste of blunt sweetness spice and some pumpkin bar on the back end very spicy though great body with sweet sumptuousness a not bad stout altogether
1256,Dark O' The Moon,3.86,dark bitter chocolate on the nose and at the front of the first sip is nice pumpkin is dfinitely the star of the show as always with me if there was a bit carbonation bite it would be rated a little higher this pairs well with a good medium to strong mid to full bodied cigar i enjoyed it with a 2012 by oscar short robusto the flavors were very complimentary
1257,Dark O' The Moon,2.75,not the best stout i have had a little bitter taste while canvtaste the pumpkin the overall taste is not good i will not be buying this one again
1258,Dark O' The Moon,3.58,umm i wouldnt say that im mad but your boy also isnt stoked like a honey bee on a cheerio im here with this waterlike beverage did arrowhead brew a beer yu could fool me i was told back in the day parents would water down a glass of wine for the kids to get them stoked and stuff well here we have a beer that seems water downed for jr but thats not me im raul again not awful but this offering does not make raul day boo
1259,Dark O' The Moon,3.14,black with thick brown head excellent retention splotchy lace roast aromas are quickly taken over by pumpkin spice hint of winter squash though lots of nutmeg and cinnamon some coffeeish roast a bit of roasted pumpkin flavor mediumheavy bodied with appropriate carbonation wouldve liked spice to be turned down a bit to let the base beer shine
1260,Dark O' The Moon,3.89,deep dark brown with some ruby highlights and a moderate but lasting milk chocolate colored head and even a bit of lacing the aroma is pumpkin cinnamon and chocolate malt the taste is the same with enough spice to produce some bitterness up front then mellows in the middle with some herbal bite in the finish the body is mediumfull moderate carbonation fairly smooth altogether this is an interesting take on pumpkin beer i think the stout style adds to the pumpkin deepens the flavor and rounds it out a bit
1261,Dark O' The Moon,3.63,pours a chocolate brown with a modest two finger head aroma is roasted malt and pumpkin which is mirrored in the taste as well cinnamon is very noticeable body and mouthfeel are quite light for a stout and low on carbonation though pumpkin is present the roasted malt and to some extent the cinnamon seems to make its presence known a bit more a different take on the usual pumpkin beer
1262,Dark O' The Moon,4,appearance deep black in color with a modest finebeaded tan head with good persistence an irregular unbroken ring is formed about the glass wall  aroma rich notes of cloves cinnamon and nutmeg vie with dark roasted malt brown sugar and spicy alcohol  taste the taste opens with pumpkin spices dark malts and spicy alcohol while bitter cocoa vies with brown sugar later on three are cold coffee notes at the close of the taste there is a bit of nut flavor and a lingering mild earthiness  mouth feel full smooth and very soft with a bit of soft carbonation  drinkabilitynotes a very wellmade example and elegant that brings something new to a familiar style certainly this is not a typical choice for april nonetheless i found it quite pleasing  presentation packaged in a standard twelveounce brown glass bomber with a pryoff crown served in a la fin du monde tulip at the lake house
1263,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.32,12 oz bottle with a 26 october 2020 bottling date stamped on the back label  near black body with a thin semidurable beige head a thin dark reddishbrown edge is visible with back lighting this smells quite sweet i assume from the bourbon and maple syrup it has a lightly sweet taste with a laudably balanced mix of chocolate bourbon and coffee not surprisingly maple syrup notes are faint relatively thick and very smooth body well hidden abv overall the dessert version of kbs
1264,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.47,poured stout black and was topped by a dense brown head of 1 in height with lots of lacing down the snifter the aroma was strong so strong even my covid affected nose caught a wiff of the chocolate and bourbon the taste was very well balanced for so much chocolate and rich chocolate at that it was the star of the show but the supporting cast of coffee and dark fruits and bourbon were not lost but very present the feel is darned near ideal for the genre just a tiny bit less chewy or viscous than expected good beer if they brew it again i would drink it fresh instead of cellaring it for 3 years but even then it is very good
1265,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.5,032523 bottle  home
1266,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.23,bottle poured a pitchblack color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing aroma of chocolate notes with some fudge notes and vanilla and bourbon notes are also perceptible taste is a mix of chocolatefudge with some maple notes and some vanilla and bourbon notes also clearly identifiable body is pretty full with good carbonation and light warming alcohol notes soldi ba stout with some good adjunct but it does get a little bit cloying at some point
1267,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.18,a bottle dated 080922 refrigerated since purchasing in november of the same year poured in a kbs snifter for the review  a vigorous pour produces a dark brown liquid churning up a small finger of tan foam it settles very quickly to a ring around the glass the smell is dominated by what else mackinac fudge a slight whiff of dark roast coffee im not getting anything else the taste is very much like the smell pure fudge followed by dark roast coffee a bit ashy tasting in the finish but nothing that detracts from the experience the feel is medium bodied rich and smooth  in all its pretty typical kbs in that the barrel is invisible ditto for any maple in my opinion ive always been a fan of kbs and appreciate its simple goodness this one is worth your time and the price was right at 214 pack
1268,Dead Flowers,3.42, 090523  on tap chickiespetes  
1269,Dead Flowers,4.09,solid ipa looks it smells like fresh skunk weed combined with lemon zest herbs fresh cut flowers potpourri and peppery spices it tastes like skunk weed cut off the vine mixed with grapefruit lemon zest coriander lime piney notes biscuit flowers mint papaya and fruity candy not overly bitter but it hides the abv well
1270,Dead Flowers,4.25,look beautiful hazy yellow of pure pineapple juice aroma mild pineapple ripe plums slight grapefruit taste pineapple juice plums mild grapefruit feel soft and round tight but slippery overall very good really enjoyed this
1271,Dead Flowers,3.93,poured a pale straw color decent head and carbonation although head quickly dissipated  the nose was wonderful and intriguing a strong grapefruittart fruit smell and something i cannot quite identify maybe an evergreen forest after rain  the taste was a bit flat it did not have that pop i have come to expect from vermont brews there was some limecitrus tones with decent bitterness throughout  but overall it felt  light the taste had little cling and went away far too quickly for a neipa  i did feel it would an excellent pairing with grilled white seafood scallops shrimp whitefish

1274,Cerveza Aguila,3.02,bottle from half time country tick brilliantly clear medium gold in color with a small bubbly white head fed by a steady stream of carb bubbles cereal grain and light green apple with faint earthy spicy hops typical macro not offensive
1275,Cerveza Aguila,3.81,this was given to me by a friend who picked it up while on a cruise he said it was the worst beer ever but i found it to be a pleasant surprise poured from a 473ml can into a lager flute very nice appearance with a thick snowy white head atop a pale golden colored body aromas and flavors of light biscuit and notes of grass grain and herbal hops there is a spicy hop kick on the palate with some pleasant bitterness and a crisp dry finish light bodied as expected with a little sweetness that is not at all overpowering recommended if you can find it
1276,Cerveza Aguila,2.93,there is a lesson here that when you chase getting beers from countries as i have columbia is my 63rd then you are far more likely to endup drinking beer that is not as good as you like to drink so it is with aguila  there are adjunct lagers that define the style and then there are those who brew but dont have lots of competition i suspect aguila is a product of the latter  aguila looks of average color but mine is almost nonexistent foam smells are pleasant almost a faint hard fruit in there but then it fades to not much quickly tastes are so nondescript that i almost want my money back but the goal was to get to 63 countries feel is semidry like most good aals but aguila is thinner than at least half of the competition   as for who barranquilla is and who owns them that is above my pay scale google says they are columbias 1 beer because it is balanced not too far from my truth and that it is owned by millercoors then ratebeer claims barranquilla now bavaria is owned by ab inbev regardless of who owns them im not getting rich off of any of them or are they elevating my enjoyment
1277,Cerveza Aguila,3.74,decanted from a 112 oz 330 ml bottle into a custom taster pint best by june 20 2019 a pours a crystal clear golden color with a one finger foamy white head brief retention bit little lacing s grainy and grassy aromas with an apple note t dry fruity apple and very lightly malty with light bitterness only enough to create crispness and balance m light bodied with low carbonation drinks smoothly crisply and cleanly o this is a solidly constructed lager i would say a cut above most aals international or domestic
1278,Cerveza Aguila,3.19,from the 112 fl oz bottle with no date shown sampled on march 15 2019  yellow bubbly and carbonated pour with good clarity and a fizzy shortlived white head  like all these adjuncts i pick up a kind of crackery and gassy sensation on the nose it seems to be sweet but it does not put me off worth at least a 3 rating based on the style elements
1279,Saison Du Fermier,4.18,tart light refreshing nuanced acidic and dry taste is grape oak barnyard funk and lemon zest
1280,Saison Du Fermier,4.65,blend 6  tart musty peaches and lemon zest on the nose palate with a restrained acid and pleasant pucker bringing mild oaky funk  bright citrus finishes dry yet juicy with a lingering tartness such a good blend
1281,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.25,pours a dark black color with a nice tan head and lacing aroma has a nice whiskey and vanilla hints the taste has nice whiskey and vanilla notes a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a good imperial porter
1282,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,3.75,this just wasnt as dope to me as id hoped but overall still solid easy feel for the beer still despite the abv percentage but i just found it a little meh honestly pretty high floor though still would have again
1283,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.07,vintage 22a  i remember hearing about og gonzo being an awesome beer when i first joined ba i looked around for it for a while but never ended up finding it fast forward 4 years and i end up finding the barrel aged version instead lets see if it can live up to my expectations from all those years ago  pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  there is a hefty bitterness to the nose here just really intense im picking up on aromas of herbal hops toasted oak cacao nib earthy whiskey burnt toast toffee and light vanilla  it shows a similar bitterness in taste but its nicely done on the front end of the sip im tasting cocoa powder burnt coffee dark toast earthy whiskey herbal hops light caramel and molasses the swallow brings notes of burnt toast herbal hops earthy whiskey toasted oak cocoa powder toffee brown sugar and light raisin  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a brisk and bitter beer finishes slightly sticky but goes down remarkably easy for the abv  its nothing amazing like i was told it was back in the day but its a very solidly done beer in the old school fashion
1284,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.06,12 oz bottle 2022 vintage  pours an extremely dark but not quite jet black tan colored head big aroma of bourbon and dark chocolate taste has those elements but is pretty oaky and roasty drier finish medium bodied
1285,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.15,purchased at wegmans in warrington pa 20994pk 12oz bottles limited barrel series listed on the label vintage 22  pours a deep deep brown almost black color a thick frothy mochacolored head on the initial pour fades to a scattered thin coating on top of the beer  a roasted malty aroma with hints of whiskey  a delicious porter tastes of chocolate roasted malts with a distinct bourbon taste from the aging slightly acidic bitter aftertaste the 113 abv is well hidden but its definitely lurking there not a brew youll want to rush through  a medium consistency beer with medium carbonation  overall a great barrelaged porter ive had other willett bourban barrelaged beers and this is a true winner nice job flying dogcheers
1286,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.07,solid black appearance medium light carbonation with about an average body aroma is woodearthy roasted malt boozy with some dark chocolate taste was almost dry otherwise stayed true to the aroma this was very goodmore dry than expected
1287,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.31,pours dark as coal nice tan head the bourbon comes through in the nose and taste nice warmth afterwards very good stuff
1288,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,3.81,poured into a 16 oz snulip glass never sure when it was bottled with flying dog pours a very dark brown with a finger plus light brown head that leaves thick streaks of lace with excellent retention 425  aroma is woody oak char leather vanilla bean dark chocolate and bourbon 375  taste follows the bourbon hits first oaked vanilla char leather and dark chocolate 375  mouthfeel is above medium soft carbonation a little dry and at 113 you know you are drinking something from the barrel 4  overall the barrel totally takes over and for my preference a little boozy with plenty of other flavors but they kind of get lost 375
1289,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.37,bottle dated vintage22a whatever that means into pint glass pours a quite dark brown with a persistent light tan head initial impression is a quite complex blend of dark chocolate roasted malts bourbon oak and a hint of molasses mouthfeel is medium  slightly too thin for a stout but damn close finish is clean and a bit boozy overall this is one of the best imperial porters ive had
1290,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.01,served a snifter from the bottle  appearance a semi thin dark brown espresso coloured body consisting of dark brown which looks black but is evidently transparent super dark  smell light liquor aroma which dissipates very quickly  taste from the front a darker chocolate malt coming off with heavy whiskey  mouth heavy whiskey feel which feels almost like a lighter body imperial stout  overall great grab which comes off boozy but still worth grabbing always in a glass
1291,Emperor Julius,4.59,l  opaque hazy goldenorange with a soft offwhite head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind a good amount of lacing s  floralgrassy piney hops along with tons of citrus and malt t  follows the nose orange bomb up front and throughout intermixed well with piney bitter grassy hops f  full bodied light to moderate carbonation soft fluffy smooth o  an orange dipa bomb and a fantastic example of a neipa
1292,Emperor Julius,4.63,reviewer prior is too hilarious to ignore i also hope i never fall prey to reverse lupulin threshold shift  dang well my reviews get duller and duller over the years  this is a damn good beer by tree house you should get it
1293,Emperor Julius,4.66,serving can canned aug22023 consumed aug152023  thats what im talking about after a couple th beers that seemed noticeably different in overall profile than my memory of them i was starting to get worried that either they had majorly tweaked something my memory was failing my senses were wonky or worst of all that i had fallen prey to reverse lupulin threshold shift but praise be that doesnt seem to be the case this bad boy is dead on  from the look to the aroma to the taste to the palate the whole thing just pops and met my standard unconscious audible groanswearing for being nighperfect solid representation of the style to my tastes and noticeably a tree house character cant do much better than that  the nose and flavor are big characterful mixes of sweet citrus ripe mango with a dash of boozy citruslupuline oil aromatics like the oil that you can see spray off a twisted rind of the light is just right the flavor is similar and has a nice bitter but not overly bitter boozy but not too much finish to it that kind of dissolves into orange rind and makes it take all my concentration to not just plow through the glass as it warms and this one started out at cellar temp the perfumeyboozy character mentioned above melts into a creamy sweet sort of character that really ties the whole beer together and sums up that classic estery fruity soft juicy th character simply excellent  glad i have a couple more and many thanks minor god of drunken flannel for peer pressuring me into buying it  42545475475475    actually typing this out i realized this is the first of these recent tree house beers that came out of my trusty beer fridge 485 and not a normal fridge temps below 40 i think there well could be something to that and my last 34 seeming a little lackluster lesson to you kids out there that warmer is often better contrary to what big beer brainwashes us with   the last drink in the glass made me unconsciously curse out loud alone on my balcony better than the first sip bumped overall up 025 points
1294,Emperor Julius,4.23,a finger and a half worth of an airy yet fluffy bone white colored froth sid retention color is an opaque pale orange nose is much more muted than expected light orange juice and subtle tropical fruits flavor profile is completely inline with the nose feel is medium to full bodied rather sturdy and mostly sleek with a good bite reaaly good and rather unique but didnt quite live up to the rather lofty expectations i had built up
1295,Emperor Julius,3.93,pours a turbid golden with off white head great retention to be fair freshly squeezed florida oranges straight off the tree i find that tree house beers dont always deliver on the hoppy aromatics but this one does somewhat i get a lot of mango kind of in that dole tropical juice deliver with some rind citrus on the finish on subsequent sips the rind and citrus which you could call dank is more pronounced and the tropicality has all but disappeared its sharp as sabtos said its kind of boring after the first sip to be honest and it lacks the balance that regular julius has this is fine
1296,Emperor Julius,4.33,tried at greggs 61623
1297,Gulden Draak,4.53,in a word wow  like a desert in a glass  i think this is a one and done meaning have one and then youre done  incredibly easy to drink and super potent  dark malty carmely etc  much love
1298,Gulden Draak,4.18,poured reddish brown tan head that dissipated quickly the aroma was lost on my covid damaged nose the taste was a bit sweeter than expected and had the bready malts and candied fruit for the abv it is too easy to drink the feel was surprisingly active with the lack of head i wasnt expecting the tingling aspect oa seriously easy drinking tasty and a treat if not for the abv id drink these all the time
1299,Gulden Draak,4.68,l  reddish brown with a large tan head that sticks around leaving behind a ton of lacing s  belgian yeast candi sugar fruit esters dates and figs honey t  follows the nose bready belgian yeast and candi sugar up front and throughout intermixed well with fruit esters  dates and figs honey some caramel light spices f  medium bodied with high carbonation o  a fantastic belgian  maybe more of a strong dark ale vs a red triple but very good nonetheless
1300,Gulden Draak,3.98,dark burnt amber to brown with a pinkish tan head that dies quickly to a thin fuzzy ring  caramelized gingersnap meets a hint of candy apple before coming to a boozy rumlike finish
1301,Gulden Draak,4.21,330ml stubby bottle into a tulip code of 25jv whatever that means  fine looking dark reddish body with an impressive off white head leaving thick lacing sweet aroma with matching flavor strong without being boozy warming malty a light dark fruit taste with a featherlight bitter note late in the finish
1302,Gulden Draak,4.03,very good beer i prefer chimay blue but this beer seems to improve with every sip it is a little sweet but not overly so and has a great body and a finish that stays with you drank in a teku glass from a bottle but would love to taste this on tap
1303,Gulden Draak,4.16,365ml bottle  carbonation has the bottle overflowing once i crack the lid pours two fingers of dense tan head into my snifter retention is very nice but does eventually fade lacing is subpar body is a deep reddish brown looks decent  nose has plenty of sweetness with notes of fig and plum tart esters quickly appear and add a much needed balance reminiscent of cherries no clove smells massive as youd expect a little on the sweet side for me but i can dig it  flavor blasts you with a massive dose of stone fruit has a sweet impression but drinks very clean maybe a touch of tart cherries in the background overall its still not my goto style but its impressive and certainly something i would not turn down  the carbonation is medium by the time i go looking for it dont recall it being insanely high to begin with sweetness is apparent but pretty modest compared to what it could be well attenuated bitterness is low and only really shows up briefly in the finish with the tart fruit has some body but comes through surprisingly light given the modest sugar and carbonation overall the mouthfeel stays reasonable and it brings a somewhat smooth feel that supports the beer nicely  all things considered the drinkability is very very nice there is zero alcohol and the sweetness is in check  between the flavor and the mouthfeel the beer drinks even better than it smells very nice
1304,Gulden Draak,4.32,330ml bottle poured into a tulip  a two finger khaki head seals the slightly hazy chestnut pour into the tulip the persistent foam is tight and creamy except for an island of spongy foam rising slightly in the middle of the glass  the nose is full and malty an opening mineral aroma fades revealing dark fruit raisin milk chocolate and toffeelike dark sugars and a hoppy note in the back the taste is less sweet than expected malty pruny and sweet candied plum flavors with some mineral notes seem to be cut short by a semidry and fairly clean finish hop bitterness is very mild mouthfeel is medium weight with moderate carbonation and soft right through  the clean finish and lack of alcohol character make for a dangerously fast drinking 105 abv glass of beer very enjoyable
1305,Wit,4.5,pours a hazy yellow with massve thick head  smell is crisp and yeasty with notes of citrus citrus peel green apples banana candy and cloves  taste is crisp and yeasty with a soft bitterness notes of citrus citrus peel cloves bananas and some apples  mouthfeel is medium and smooth with effervescent carbonation  overall a great witbier probably the best ive had
1306,Wit,4.24,112 oz bottle exp date 11724 into a chalice l pours hazy white yellow with a fizzy head that recedes quickly to white edge foam low fine carbo no lacing s floral coriander candy sweetness t sweet wheat herbal spices coriander a hint of orange lemon apple tartness a touch of honey wild flowers f brisk gently fizzy  punchy lightly juicy medlight body with a fast and dry finish has a light champagne quality about it o a very unique spicy taste and rather quenching and ez drinking has a very palpable dry finish and a relaxed profile fruity and lightly sweet it is outstanding in its style
1307,Wit,4.22,great creamy feel well rounded with notes of banana and coriander goes down really silky but real fullness too very enjoyable
1308,Wit,4.33,cloudy yellow big white head excellent retention spotty lace aromas of pasta water coriander orange herbs slight spice cream of wheat orange coriander light spice slightly tart light bodied but fluffy well carbonated not that big on wits but this is a good one
1309,Wit,4.29,lightly hazed gold srm 57 with a big white fluffy head that holds 2 briefly before slowly melting over the next five minutes delicate belgian lace coats the glass while fine columns of carbonation lazily float upwards  the aroma has a pleasantly mild wheat backbone modest spicy yeast dances with light coriander kicking up some dust in its wake  wheat bread and a mild sensation of overripe banana gives way to coriander the coriander is mild yet much more present than the aroma had suggested the finish is faint and lingering warmth reveals unmistakable lime flavors and generally brings significant improvements to the experience the bitterness and sweetness are both mild and balanced  it has a creamy full body with a soft jersey cotton texture carbonation is modest while the alcohol is as expected it has a dryness front to back  this is another great summer beer which i am enjoying out back while reading and watching the deer graze mild august days are made for beers like this one
1310,Wit,4.26,look strawcolored and hazy nice two finger head  aroma pleasantly bready with traces of lemon  taste creamy wheat flavor again detecting lemon and kind of want to add more just a hint of good quality funk very easy to drink  feel light and creamy some fine effervescence  outstanding exhibit of the style
1311,Wit,4.45,poured from a 330ml bottle into a sp lambic glass pours a foggy dull yellow with a fluffy but soapy white foam head lots and lots of citrusy orange limes and lemons on the nose a hint of pepper wonderful taste is more balanced between the orange and lemon and peppery spice with a wheatdry finish full mouthfeel with a high level of carbonation which is crazy that this still maintains the fullness it does really really excellent wit bier
1312,Wit,3.78,decent but not a fan of the style for some reason although this is the best wit beer iv had so far
1313,Slapasaurus,4.07,first impressions arent good theres way too much stark white foam just from cracking open a pint can with resultant overflowing the attempted pour to try to empty the cans contents into a clear glass liter mug is also frustrated by all the foam thats surprising as high abv brews usually arent this foamy obviously theres more than barley malt here providing the starch backbone the foam recedes unevenly unattractively and leaves erratic lacing inside the vessel once it can be determined the liquid is light copperamber bright and somewhat translucent the aroma is limited to a dry hoppiness with some vague starch it doesnt taste badly of course theres alcohol present and its immediate the hop taste is vague maybe piney but certainly bittering the biggest surprise and the biggest plus is the mouthfeel despite an alcoholic burn to the taste buds this is remarkably soft and smooth across the tongue overall it actually has a tasty malted backbone along with a nice dry hop bite to finish the pronounced taste of alcohol is mitigated by its smooth mouthfeel and that it has an abv close to 10 this is another example of alcohol adding to the sweetness upfront then drying out the bitterness at the finish a final surprise is the stratified glass lacing once the foam subsided there are many worse options to down a pint for a serious beer buzz
1314,Slapasaurus,4.28,appearance  the beer was golden yellow in appearance with visible carbonation  smell  the iconic 3 floyds dankness is followed by fruity notes  taste  there were definite citrus fruit notes the malt presence was somewhat weak despite the big body the big mover was the lemon dankness that lingered nicely  mouthfeel  the body was big leading to a lingering profile  overall  this is definitely worth checking out for floyds fans
1315,Slapasaurus,4.46,the seldom studied and often forgotten imperial american ipa may be a beer destined for the history books but 3 floyds is single handedly keeping the style alive with this dinosaur of a beer  slapasaurus hits the glass with a medium amber appearance rounded with a reasonably hop induced haze as its creamy offwhite froth builds so to a host of tropical fruit aromas with citrus spruce and grassy herbs in the backdrop but a maltysweet upstart gives the palate a calmer taste of honey caramel graham cracker and granola with the beers opening taste  as the malts stew persistently on the middle palate a quick followup of hops give a bold tropical impression of pineapple mango and papaya not to be outdone more citrusy tones of red grapefruit tangerine and lime aid the beers racy and fruity zest trending rapidly bitter the taste develops a strong and deeply resinous bite with flavors of fruit peels pine needle freshcut grass and hemp in its wake  medium bodied and sticky with both malt and hop resins the session finishes decidedly on the bitter side of bittersweet with drier take on maltydry as the spicy ale comes to a close a long follow through of pine sap citrus remnants and cura√ßao liquortype spice comes in perpetual waves
1316,Slapasaurus,4.49,on tap pours a very slightly hazy orange smell and taste are more old school west coast ipa which is fine by me pine resin and grapefruit dominate nicely bitter no booze taste at all very drinkable medium body fantastic beer
1317,Slapasaurus,4.5,pours a bright mango color with a subtly unfiltered appearance and a foamy pearl white head that provides significant lacing and caps the beer on its entire journey gorgeous beer  the nose features loads of mango papaya guava pineapple and candied orange notes this beer is setting up especially well for my palate i gotta admit i love when that happens  the taste is all about the bitterness that settles at the back of your palate after enjoying the vibrant mango candied orange papaya guava and pineapple flavors you experience up front if you dont enjoy bracingly bitter wcdipas avoid this beer at all costs  if you do enjoy those og beers as i do so much this beer is your jam especially with the full exceptionally dry mouthfeel i found this listed on the 3fs website as 74 ibus and 98 ibus  it is definitely the latter imho and if it moved from the limited release ipas category to always available it would be in my beer fridge every day of the year
1318,Slapasaurus,4.56,color is on the copper side light to tan head nose is magical nice and piney taste was pine and slightly citrus good amount of bitterness on the backend
1319,Coffee Bender,3.92,tastes as close to cold steeped coffee as ive had in a beer
1320,Coffee Bender,4.18,the beer is a very dark brown with some garnet peeking through mediumsized tan head a little lace coffee aroma some roasted malt strong coffee taste espresso coffee taste lingers a little bit of chocolate some late hoppiness mediumbodied i liked how the coffee stayed present
1321,DirtWolf,4.91,pours with nice foam and golden color smells heavenly hoppy and some citrus complex but awesome taste smooth and some sweetness at first and awesome hoppiness at the end definitely my favorite dipa
1322,DirtWolf,4.29,poured from a twelve ounce bottle the body is an orangebrown very clear fluffy white head that creates a ring at the edge good lacing nice looking beer  aroma is a light citrus grass and light pine a wee note of bread dough  taste follows nose briefly then a nice hop bitterness the malt vaguely honey flavored nicely balances this bite and the swallow dries up smoothly no sign of the abv in the taste but it is most definitely felt  good mouthfeel as the carbonation is solid and the beer is soft on the palate  an easy drinking 87 beer that i imagine would be fabulous on tap catch this one fresh as it is an excellent beer
1323,DirtWolf,4.04,pours a rich deep gold with ample head smells fairly predictable for the style herbal hoppy some citrus perhaps the flavor is herbal hop smack from the first sip bitter the citrus and fruit flavors make their presence as it warms up decent malt and of course it packs a wallop but still reasonable at 87 this was my go shelf double ipa for about 2 years but i havent seen it out here for several years now and it tastes a little different than i remember but another solid beer from victory cheers
1324,DirtWolf,5,say no more worldclass
1325,DirtWolf,4.23,best by 923  poured into a willi glass at fridge temp  pours a brassy and dark copper with a full creamy and fluffy head 425  i get some sweet and ripe pineapple on the nose as well as some mixed florals 425  taste starts out tropical with some light sweetness to it moves on to bitter pine and associated florals though i think it balanced out nicely as i kept sipping 425  body has a moderate heft carbo is the same and has lingering pine and florals resins 4  overall a very good dipa that got better and was interesting and dynamic as i imbibed over a half hour and enjoyed the whole time 425
1326,DirtWolf,4.21,with a clear coppery appearance a very hoppy aroma and the taste of hops hitting you from start to finish this is a great dipa for sipping on an relaxing evening
1327,DirtWolf,4.75,this is goodcant tell you exactly why but me likey

1333,Balaton,4.32,blend 2 unsure of the year  weve arrived far too soon at my last beer from my recent trade with merpunk1 this is the highest rated oud bruin on ba and the combination of chambourcin barrels and cherries has me excited to try it its also pretty cool that its only 5 so i imagine it will drink very easily  pours a dark reddish brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing  theres a decent amount of complexity going on in the nose on this one given that some of these can be onedimensionally tart im picking up on aromas of tart black cherry dates red wine vinegar sweet red grape toffee brown bread and a touch of cinnamon  the tartness is really forward in taste but the complexity is still awesome on the front end of the sip im tasting black cherry chewy grape brown bread sharp oak and light cinnamon the swallow brings notes of tart black cherry candy red wine toffee dates and a touch of leather  a light medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a sharp and tart beer finishes lightly sticky but still retains enough tartness to keep it from being cloying  this is delicious stuff man i really wish i had easier access to side project beers they make truly fantastic stuff

1337,Boxer Lager,2.98,poured from a silo can into a pint glass pours golden orange with a fluffy white head smells of sweet adjunct grain nothing else tastes of plain lager grain beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation overall an average beer
1338,Boxer Lager,2.62,compared to coors light masterclass
1339,Boxer Lager,2.57,note i was honest on four of the categories but boosted the overall score due to the budget of this beer  i enjoy many styles of craft beer and will on occasion spend nearly 30 on a four pint pack of high quality stuff today i was looking to stock up on football watching beer my gotos have been high life or yeungling for the bulk drinking lagers i was at a shop rite in new jersey on novermber 5th 2022 when i happened upon this stuff i saw 30 packs of natty and genessee for 24 high life was 26 something called boxer premium lager was 1999 for a 36 case that is 55 cents a can in 2022 i though jeez that will probably be god awful and likely poisonous so i checked beeradvocate and it got some decent reviews i said ill give it a try if its awful i only have 35 more
1340,Boxer Lager,5,not to objective because it is my favorite lager and costs less than a buck for 24 ounces  it has a carapils malt taste that harkens to the beers they made at that brewery since i started drinking some comments attribute it to yeastwhich makes some sense because you couldnt afford expensive malt at that price  most younger serious beer drinkers are sucking down heavy hopped beers if your looking for your beer to taste like high gravity bitters or grapefruit you will need to spend more money  this beer is distinctive and produced in relatively tiny batches at the price there is no comparison  it reminds me a bit of beer from india
1341,Boxer Lager,3.74,this is what happens when millennial beersnob knowitalls review a beer  if this beer were twice as expensive and packaged differently with maybe the silhouette of muhammad ali or a sharp photograph of a boxing glove the 30somethings would be falling all over themselves  as it is this is a cheap easily drinkable beer with a wonderful mouthfeel and a nutmeg hefeweizen taste  not my first choice but an ok choice  is it a budhead  the tantalizing wonderful heavenly mix of two great north american loggers moosehead and budweiser mixed in a 5050 proportion  hells no  nothing is   and if youre not thinking of going to the store and buying a sixer of each both moosehead and budweiser and trying it yourself in a tall dimpled or nonic glass then you are simply a fool   but i digress boxer is a cheap easy buzz throw a lemon slice in and maybe once squeeze of honey and youve got yourself a terrific summer cooler even adding ice wont ruin things for you
1342,Boxer Lager,1.04,id rather go sober manjit is disgusting
1343,Boxer Lager,3.61,poured from 12ounce can into a vintage odouls bowtie glass stunningly clear golden color with a finger or two of white head that settles rather rapidly as aals go this is pretty inoffensive boxer is light bodied not too sweet and mostly dry on the finish with some light grain grassy hops and hints of tart apple on the nose and palate pretty typical however there is something else going on here there are unmistakable notes of hefeweizen yeast which contribute aromas and flavors of banana and clove these notes are present in some other offerings from minhas  rhinelander as well is this a characteristic of their house yeast i dont know but those notes of banana and clove really give this a pleasant kick and you cant beat the price
1344,Boxer Lager,3.32,l clear light bright orange with noticable carbonation for a lasting thick ring and partial patch a cracker vague cereal grain faint candy corn bread hay dry grass smells just ok t bready and biscuity a bit corn chipy some citrus in there like lemon and orange pith corn flakes with a sprinkle of sugar some toffeehoney maltiness in there as well finishes with a pithy bitterness and a pinch of ethanol f not actually watery a bit above a light body below average carbonation not too dry o given all the lousy reviews im pleasantly surprised heady topper it aint but you could pay twice as much for for a worse beer
1345,Boxer Lager,1,colleges kids drink this because its cheap its disgusting deserves a zero rating
1346,Boxer Lager,2.5,l pours yellow gold permeated by streams of rapidly rising bubbles under a 1 frothy white cap with poor retention  s some apple green apple faint hops and a hint of movie theater popcorn butter green apple is the biggest aroma  t sweet corn and a mild corn sweetness start the flavors with apple some very mild spicy hop flavor and a very mild hop bitterness  f the body is light and the carbonation is medium full  o the beer is slightly sweet and misses the boat on character and interest
1347,Boxer Lager,2.75,its a cheap lager nothing more nothing less pours a watery gold head diminishes quickly very weak aroma corny barley flavors highly carbonted
1348,Boxer Lager,2.59,minhas craft brewery boxer lager 12 fl oz can production coded but without freshness dating 699  15pack case  javies beverage philadelphia pa  notes via stream of consciousness its clear but not as clear as i thought it would be i cant see my finger prints through the glass nor are my fingers really that clear odd the initial fingerthick head of bright white that rose up over the fairly deep golden body is now already gone but there are some splashes of lacing left behind the aroma is sweetish and dare i say malty its not grainy and its clear that theres some adjunct in use but there is some maltiness to it theres also unfortunately some esters that i connect with higher fermentation not good the flavor follows and again its surprisingly malty and sweetish like wort i dont detect any specific oxidation like a papery characteristic but it could be that some initial oxidation is making it seem more malty just a theory its medium bodied and crisp i didnt find any hops in the aroma nor do i find any in the flavor except for a touch of an herbal and leafy note in the finish its background though and that higher alcohol ester thing is still there and distracting this is obviously not well made but its cheap  although there are many better made budget beers on the market that cost less disappointing  275  25  25  325  25  259 out of 5
1349,Boxer Lager,2.87,poured from 24 oz can into a pint glass  appearance  the beer pours a very nice golden amber color with tons of tiny bubbles streaming up through the brew and producing a two finger head of white foam the head has a modest level of retention fading over time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass  smell  the aroma of the brew is strongest of sweeter smells of caramel and a decent showing of corn syrup along with these aromas comes a decent amount of a metallic smell  taste  the taste begins with a mix of a bready light caramel and corn cereal taste mixed with a bit of a metallic flavor the metallic flavor gets stronger in nature as the taste advances all while the bready and the corn fade a bit all the while a bit of a cardboard flavor develops and with a loss much of the caramel one is left with a somewhat off metallic and cardboard corny taste to linger on the tongue  mouthfeel  the body of eh brew is on the slightly thicker side for a 5  adjunct lager with a carbonation level that was average a little thinner body may have been slightly better for the mix of caramel and corn upfront and may have downplayed some of the off flavors slightly better overall the feel was not all that bad though  overall  not the tastiest of brews but for the cheap price it is actually a decent go too a good party brew
1350,Zombie Ice,4.41,fantastic piney hoppy smell i taste some tropical fruity flavors like pineapple and guava with more sweetness than zombie dust more malt and more sweetness make this wellbalanced the bitterness lingers with astringency a little more syrupy than i would like the mouthfeel its really quite good if they werent nearly 20 including tax for 4 at meijer this might be a regular drink for me
1351,Zombie Ice,3.81,copper colored with a half inch of creamy beige on top lightly soapy lacing im smelling melon pine and alcohol im tasting melon pine and alcohol the mouth moderately carbonated and a touch boozy
1352,Zombie Ice,4.26,semihazy copper amber appearance with a soapy white head decent retention and lacing pineapple pear pine malt alcohol well hidden medium body moderate carbonation creamy mouthfeel
1353,Zombie Ice,4.13,extra large 192 oz and fairly fresh can with a june 2023 canning date stamped on the bottom served in a 6l beer glass  appearance deep amber colored clear body it is topped with a modest size white head that has good retention and leaves plentiful lacing on the glass  this is an imperial pale ale were that a category given the 85 abv the high abv however is well hidden being most evident in the mouthfeel moreover the flavor has about average bitterness with a strength that seems just a bit higher than average fruity aroma with clean well balanced flavor the best beer ive ever had with ice in its name
1354,Zombie Ice,4.45,on tap at blackback pub in waterbury vt  this one pours a rusted orangeish color with a small head and lots of lacing  this smells like orange piney hops lightly sweet malt marijuana and grapefruit  this isnt as good as zombie dust  thats an alltime classic but its still cool to see an ampedup version of it its lightly malty but not as much as youd expect its very orangey with lots of grapefruit with marijuana and clean piney bitterness  this is medium bodied clean with a smooth bitterness on the back end and very drinkable  i still really enjoy the old school ipa stylings from three floyds
1355,Zombie Ice,4.25,16 oz on tap at art and craft beer ny loved it maybe even better than zombie dust a bit more balanced and malty but just as crisp and easy to drink a little dank citrus pine refreshing good price too
1356,Zombie Ice,4.33,hazy orangey yellow body with a full white head and ring of lacing caramel malt base with resinous pine hops orange and grapefruit nose taste is more fruity with apricot and slight pineapple added to the huge citra hop notes grapefruit king amongst the fruits pine and resin snaps the finish great balance so smooth and resinous with a bittering finish full yet medium bodied this is better than normal zombie dust i said it
1357,Zombie Ice,4.66,what the heck if you love zombie dust youll love this crisp and clean and no caffeine 3 floyds makes outstanding brewskis so no surprise here im a huge double ipa fan and this one goes down smooth as silk my kind of lawnmower beer cheers

1359,Zombie Ice,4.29,appearance pours a slightly hazy amber color with a sturdy two finger head strong retention and shards of lacing  smell orange and orange pith aromatics dank with biscuit and pine tones complementing  taste the biscuity malts complement the orange pith hops from the outset with the hops presenting a stronger force through the middle some melon peeks through but the bitter finish dominates all  mouthfeel medium to full body with moderate carbonation some warmth in the gullet  overall true to what you would expect from the floyd brothers this is a solid throwback to the days when bitterness was what hopheads were seeking
1360,Zombie Ice,4.03,poours an effervescent light amber with a thumb pf cream colored head very good head retention  solid lacing  s some citrus a little breadyness some cattyness once warm  t grapefruit grassyness lime  dryness up front a touch of caramel  pine up front more pineyness leafy hops dryness  a little bit of grassy hop once this beer warms up finishes piney dry with some cakeyness  mf medium body restrained carbonation nicely balanced  nice old school hop bomb very drinkable
1361,Delirium Tremens,4.09,an absolute classic for a reason ive always noticed a bit of cherry and a lot of clove in this beer and its not as bitter as duvel this one needs to be served at cellar temp and not cold in my experience it makes a big difference in picking out the nuances of the yeast strain an alltime favorite for me
1362,Delirium Tremens,3.5,i had this on draft 91223  semiopaque dull yelloworange appearance  huge eggshellcolored head strong treerung lacing remained  bubblegum  soft wheat notes in the nose  soft medium mouthfeel  bubblegum  soft wheat flavors  drinkable and itll do in a pinch but this classic just isnt for me
1363,Delirium Tremens,4.03,112 oz bottle acclimated to 56f and poured into a goblet  pours a rich amberhoney gold with a long lasting 1 finger foamy white head leaving a think ring of lacing  initial aroma is clean fruit esters my brain is saying pear and pineapple but its very faint and im not sure with a somewhat sterile clear alcohol smell additionally a pepperiness a light fresh light green grassiness and a light white floral note can be found maybe damp hay i guess thats probably the yeast after agitating i notice the alcohol comes forward and a clean and pale maltiness can be found  initially before swallowing i get a peppery tingling may be due to the alcohol theres also a sweet vague fruitiness  after swallowing im hit with alcohol upfront stays at the back corners of the roof and bottom of the mouth and top of the front half and tip of the tongue and reminds me of a fruity brandy im getting specifically pear i get a malty note i can best describe as damp hay just like i smelled the pepperiness i smelled is there too it seems almost paired up with a dry somewhat bitter grassiness which differs from the grassiness i smelled a note of dry white wine reveals itself to me upon getting further in and is now present throughout the whole process the aftertaste comprises dryness alcohol burn which fades fruity fumes and that dry white wine taste  feel is very smooth with almost a chew to it fuller body than average genuinely almost a little syrupy additionally the carbonation persists meaning that i can truly enjoy this one slowly which is how i drink beer  overall it excels the flavors pair with each other exceedingly well and it exhibits a top display of coherence in beer the only thing i can think of that i would prefer is a lower abv i generally quite enjoy high and quite high abv beers but the alcohol burn in this one is reminiscent of a brandy or other spirit and its harsh to my tastes still this beer could be renamed delirium tremendous  will absolutely buy again at some point though not often thats on me though i love love love belgian dark ales but belgian pales are not my absolute favorite otherwise it would be a common purchase will be recommending to people for sure
1364,Delirium Tremens,4.03,appearance pours a nearly completely clear 90 clarity light golden color with a massive white head that lingers srm of 7 400  aroma strong aromas of belgian bread spice cloves yeast and bread malts faint citrus and flower underneath 400  flavor strong flavors of belgian bread spice flower yeast upfront it then evolves and shows the alcohol for only a bit before a rich smooth and sweet bread malt comes through with some sweet citrus and alcohol warmth to back it up finish is smooth bready and sweet 400  feel medium bodied strong carbonation creamy smooth shows the alcohol warmth and sweet 425  overall not my favorite style in a belgian strong as sometimes too heavy and boozy but this is a good one probably the best ive had still rich and boozy but also great belgian bread spice and sweet citrus flavors with a decently clean mouthfeel i usually prefer a saison or tripel with stronger yeast and spices for a belgian strong this is authentic and excellent rating 403
1365,Delirium Tremens,5,i have tried to beer from tap from the delirium tremens brewery and from the can and the bottle all of them were perfectly balanced strong ale with a nice sweet candy flavor finish looks clear and smells like sugar definitely a great beer
1366,Beck's Light,1.29,drainpour
1367,Beck's Light,1.97,good when compared to other lights but not worth drinking unless you are on a diet or minimizing the amount of alcohol consumed
1368,Beck's Light,2.02,weak ass yellow appearance more water than malt apparently no head aroma watered down the skunk i dig on from the regular version but it wasnt bad per se just missing  mild bitterness especially for the lack of hops and body for the beer so much water in this beer
1369,Beck's Light,2.61,very light beer that you might consider if you are dieting
1370,Pumpkin Ale,1.64,this just might be the worst damn beer ever with the exception of bud light why does most craft beer taste like it has charcoal for a flavor nasty crap whew
1371,Pumpkin Ale,4.31,it is an incredible beer honestly very close to pumpkin pie turned beer and makes me want to top it with whipped cream reminds me of fall walks in the woods or hikes where i could enjoy the crisp air and changing leaf colors
1372,Pumpkin Ale,4.39,golden flash of a head on a dark caramel body a proper pumpkin pie smell emanates from this one it tastes sweet in a lactose lite sense with a flavorful pumpkin body and just the right mix of spices no bitterness and not cloying either sessionable in a way but also as heavy as it should be 8 but not detectably boozy one other thing i like about this beer is that it is objectively a pumpkin beer other styles moreso mimic strong ales barleywines stouts etc but this one is simply a fine pumpkin ale and one of the best representatives of the style as it basically what you could ever want and hope for in a pumpkin beer and the fact that the mash itself is majority pumpkin as a historical basis for the brew makes it very proper indeed
1373,Pumpkin Ale,4.44,poured out a hazy amber with a white head the smell is of pumpkin cinnamon nutmeg and malt the beer really has a great taste and its like drinking a pumpkin pie with a nice alcohol addition to it good stuff
1374,Pumpkin Ale,4.18,the saint louis brewery llc pumpkin ale 12 fl oz brown glass bottle bottled with love 06212022 1409 sampled on 10112022  notes via stream of consciousness this is brewed with real pumpkin and spices and it clocks in at a solid 8 abv why not if youre going to make a pumpkin or spiced ale that someones probably only going to drink one of why not go big its poured a hazy reddish chestnut brown colored body with golden highlights beneath a short head of tan foam sugary cinnamon greets you in the nose backed by a light applelike fruitiness the flavor follows and it tastes like cinnamonspiced apple cider beyond that theres a bready and lightly caramelish malt base and notes of nutmeg and clove its moderately bitter and it finishes with a dollop of sweet malt fading to leave behind some spice thats mainly clove at this point in the mouth its medium bodied and smooth with a moderate finebubbled carbonation the head retention and lacing could both be better but for a spiced beer of 8 its not bad its not overspiced overdone in maltiness or body or alcohol and really wellbalanced across the board its really nicely done and although i suggested that spiced ales are generally a one and done kind of beer i truly believe that you could enjoy two or maybe even three of these in a row review 8311
1375,Pumpkin Ale,4.34,nice mellow pumpkin spice taste and mild aroma clean finish  no cloying aftertaste
1376,Pumpkin Ale,4.25,pours amber and smells of what youd expect from a pumpkin ale cinnamon pumpkin aromas not sweet as some pumpkins but medium bodied and full nice smooth aftertaste a nice fall pumpkin beer
1377,Crusher,4.55,poured from the can into a spiegelau ipa glass canned june 21st 2023  hazed and opaque body with a muted orange but fairly dark and still a mix of custard but has a much darker than expected color the beer nearly appears frozen head is quite soapy fine white bubbles of three fingers with light retention shampoo like top but lots of ring lacing to match  aroma is a hop surprise hints of soft dank but a real gumdrop like candy sweetness that matches nicely thick and rich with a light sense of sweet malt to counter as well the contrast between dank and sweet hop aroma on this is exceptional huge juicy dank sweet punch is the only way i can describe it like hop thick koolaid  palate brings things a little more into focus but does not hold back mid palate hits with a hot but delicious earthy mid palate punch large and bold but controlled hop blasts of pine earth juiced candy orange pineapple and mango rolling into a minty finish that just does not quit it doesnt stop there with a creamed earthy mouthfeel that feels like a sundae and smells like sweet tilled garden earth  a bit of a punishing sensation but in a real good way crushing indeed
1378,Crusher,4.98,this is one of the most underrated ipas out there great balance hop bitterness and malt no pun intended but it crushes it
1379,Crusher,4.9,154 crushable for sure
1380,Crusher,4.53,nice beer more bitter than heady or focal but not overwhelming to me this tastes more like a west coast dipa not sure if the abv is off on these but a little goes a long waythese can really sneak up on you
1381,Crusher,4.68,apillowy white head on top of a hazy bright yellow beer spine forward dank layered upon a malt base of simple light syrup and caramel mdry finish for sure with low end carbonation tearthy pine with a dank twinge and complex flavours that are almost savoury oquite the conundrum of a brew very west coast old school ipa with the bitter notes playing a leading role

1385,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2,let me start by saying i can hold my liquoralcohol quite well and in no way mean that as bragging but when this beer came out i drank 2 24oz cans because it was cheap well i went home and distroyed my entire house for no reason and couldnt even remember doing it but i was the only one home smh
1386,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.48,purchased a 24 oz can for 129 including beverage tax at a gas station in dayton ohio  look straw yellow color medium head no lacing  smell strong sweet smell green apple and malts  taste very very sweet i can barely taste any alcohol was actually disappointed by the lack of graininess since i genuinely love a good aal virtually no hops remarkably inoffensive for the high alcohol content but no character either almost like beer flavored soda with less carbonation and some alcohol the sweetness is just way too much even for a malt liquor fan there is still some fusel taste but it is masked by the extreme sweetness  feel very light body even lighter than only 8 abv cheap lagers like steel reserve and even the watery natty daddy weak carbonation which means you can chug easily and get drunk very fast which may be dangerous with a beer of this abv  overall my previous review was more positive but honestly i cant recommend this beer for anyone as a malt liquor it is terrible even compared to the usual high gravity brews and seems to be targeting the alcopop crowd with its excessive sweetness but wont please anyone except those looking for the fastest buzz from a beer interesting because it pushes the limits of what is considered beer but even earthquake is way better stay away
1387,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.78,do not buy this yes 10 alcohol is about twice that of the other drinks drink twice the other f_n drinks  look 5 looks ghetto like a 40 should looks like 10 alcohol a wisconsin product while im a state away from home smell2  eww kinda opinionated and sweet taste1 i regret spending 10 of my last 25 on 4 of these damn indiana sundayno liquorlaws making me try to bulk up on this shit tastes like a bad brew sweetened with the corn syrup from a warm 7up you know that corny ass unrefreshing shit that makes you imagine a lobe of corn a lobe of corn thats a thing right instead of the alleged lemons and limes that supposably make up 7up idk tastes liek corn to me like apart from the 500 calories of alcohol due to the 4 ounces pure alcohol this tastes like it had 200 of sugar or a jar or two of sucralose its disgusting i hate it do not buy it feel4 i am drunk though i feel slighty disgusted with myself for drinking such  whats the liquid version of slop slop is a liquid slop overall3 because drunkness is 5 and taste is one it equals 25 25 rounded is 3 ccording to my teachers thats generous af though because taste should really be negative 5 so really the score is 5 billion cuz reality do not buy this  lookclose your eyes smell dont breathe through your nose tasteawful feel drunk ppl dont have feelings silly
1388,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.11,24oz monstrous can procured during happy hour at the pizza brew in calgary stereotypical inner city brick wall graffiti imagery makes up the childish label  this beer pours a clear medium golden yellow colour with one fat finger of puffy somewhat foamy bonewhite head which leaves some stringy webbed lace around the glass as things quickly move southwards  it smells of that standard minhas house essence  musty dank cardboard industrial effluent apple cores and an acetoneheavy metallic booziness the taste is more of the same  wet paper a suggestion of grainy corn malt industrial park alcohol adult bubblegum ie boozy apple mush and very little else  but thats not the point here is it  the carbonation is soft but fairly frothy the body mediumlight in weight smooth like vodka after that initial burning sensation wears off and airily creamy for some reason it finishes sweet all surprisingly restrained alcohol heat and bland apple fruitiness like a cheaply boozedup cider  strangely not the most offputting or awfultasting offering from this brewery  sure its alcoholic but it bears that badge with pride and a pleasant enough softness other than that however this is indeed the lowbrow shit you might take it for all other things being equal
1389,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.5,okay this is not a beer to trifle with if one were to drink a 24 oz can of this and then drive a motor vehicle then he would be almost guaranteed to get arrested on a dui charge i drank only a 12 oz serving on an empty stomach and was thoroughly drunk four o street legal malt liquor has a thick offwhite creamy head and a deep golden appearance i was amazed by the abundance of ragged lacing the can design is completely politically incorrect and it nuances all the wrong things about malt liquor but for those of us who enjoy cruising the underclass of the beer world it is an interesting beer no this is certainly not the type of beer id drink on a daily basis but for kicks i am enjoying the ride so please excuse any inebriated verbiage four o has a strong apple aroma and some grain can be detected in the smell as well the taste is highly sweet and fruity with some alcohol sting to it mouthfeel is rather heavy and this concoction finishes wet and sloppy put it to you like this if all you care to drink is busch budweiser miller high life shiner bock and coors banquet etc and you dont appreciate the wild side of beer then dont fool with this stuff but however if you like to go into forbidden zones from time to time id recommend you try this with extreme trepidation to be sure well for those who relish trying outlandish unacceptable drinks like this id recommend a try at home with an ironclad assurance that you will not under any circumstances operate a motor vehichle although you may not like this beer you cant really argue that its not interesting  update note about an hour after writing this review i was hit with a nausea that lasted over 24 hours so thats what i get for going out on a limb and sampling this filth i really cant with a clear conscience recommend this trash my advice is to stay away from it and not damage your psyche  rjt
1390,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.24,oh boy oh boy oh boy this right here is taking me back back to the days when i literally drank beer out of a brown paper bag except now i pour it in a glass strange  crystal clear straw yellow color foamy white head is surprisingly sticky on the side of the glass  the aroma is a sick adjunct combo with a really putrid sourness huge corn smell  the flavor is very sweet highly grainy then like a bomb the alcohol kicks in it is like someone dropped a shot of everclear in a bud light  alcohol burn on the throat and tongue but decently carbonated  uhdrink it cold it obviously is created to get you crunk cause it is a cinch to slam and not savor which in a strange waymakes itkind of drinkable whoa i think i am gonna have my beer geekdom revoked
1391,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.27,i cant believe that i have finally gotten around to this beer it has been in my refrigerator for a couple of months awaiting me getting in the mindset to crack open a 24ounce can of what i just know in my heart of hearts will be absolute and utter rubbish i have succumbed to too much garbage in cans to expect anything else this is the backswing of the canquest  on the upswing are some really quality brews from serious brewers and then there is this kind of thing onward  i got a fingers worth of bonewhite head out of my pour with low retention settling into wisps color was a light lemonyyellow with nequality clarity nose had the same fusel alcoholbubblegum quality that has been noted in many like beers let us call it like it is  this is cheap massproduced swill intended for an audience whose sole purpose in drinking this is not for enjoyment but instead to get as banged up as cheaply and as quickly as possible mouthfeel was very thin with a raspberrycandy like taste on the tongue that was totally unexpected and nearly caused me to gag ok i just made a deal with myself  i will drink half of the can to give it a fair shake but the rest of it goes in fact i am doing a drainpour right now of everything not in my glass at the moment so that i will not even be tempted to finish it finish was breathtaking and not in any good way my chest hurts i can feel the sugar leeching the water out of my brain on my way to a worldclass hangover and my asthma is kicking oof shame on whomever made this for public sale  i dislike that i canducted a drain pour at any point during the canquest tm  i humbly apologize for having done so today is sa 26mai 2018  i am revisiting this beer in its entirety to put things right the canquest tm has a canmitment to drinking every beer to the dregsleespuntkick  this represents an early failing on my part it also may not have been reviewed to style but my current policy is not to fk with original often early scores sorry  i am so ashamed of my original that i am going to revisit this beer my overall impression given 10 years of canflection is that it is not as horrible as i made it sound it is as advertised  an american malt liquor designed to get you crunked it is still within the style guidelines but i dont even want to cantemplete them it is like quantifying garbage the maggots lent a piquant flavor   okay its a fantastic aml but as a beer in general it sux balls yer the top of the bottom this is unfit for human cansumption  any to style vs to taste reviews should be taken accandingly
1392,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.18,i recently got a 24oz can of this from my girlfriend she had noticed my malt liquor kick as of late and decided to get me some real ghetto fuel all 10 abv of it the can proclaims street legal on the front the can is interesting there is artwork depicting a city skyline with a brick wall below it and graffiti depicting the brand and details very appropriate considering the target audience for this beer here is my impressions  a again the can is interesting the beer pours a straw yellow small head that foams rapidly and disappears just as rapidly looks like a budweiser or typical american lager  s smells somewhat syrupy strong corn odors not a favorable sign prior to tasting  t i can honestly say this stuff is pretty low on my list of the worst things i have tasted i made a batch of mead last year that went wrong and it came out with a really high 17 abv this taste almost just like that with a strong sweet corn flavor it literally tastes like it might be a liqueur of some sort i am not sure it is possible to chug this even with it ice cold it would be interesting to find out the amount of carbs per serving of this stuff after a 15oz tasting glass of this i am not sure i can drink the can damn 135 down the drain  m syrupy do not want to hold it in my mouth any longer than i have to leaves a sweet alcoholic aftertaste  d awful i have a feeling if you could put this down rapidly you might vomit it probably helps to be drunk already or homeless to handle this stuff in quantity the abv puts it on par with wines for serving size of 6oz in one standard drink as opposed to 8oz for a typical malt liquor  conclusion it might be fun to show off at a party or if you are feeling the need for a quick drunk undoubtedly this stuff will cause a nasty hangover in quantity open can of this only in case of emergency
1393,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.02,poured from a 24 oz can has a golden color with a 12 inch head smell is mild a bit malty taste is yuck nothing but alcohol i would have been better served pouring this into a shot glass feels light and yucky in the mouth i really struggled to finish this can overall a poor excuse for a beer
1394,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.44,thrid review tonight  not inebriated yet  but i will be after this 24 oz  app30 looks average for a malt nice and light golden  just like a colt 45 or mickeys  smell40 sweet sweet malt and hints of alcohol even in the smell kind of looked forward to the taste  taste 15 malt and alcohol i cannot even say the alc is contained well because its not  mouthfeel 30 average medium body  due to the alcohol  drinkability 20 i can drink this  but itll be hard to pretend to enjoy it  if you want to get messed up drink two of these otherwise steer clear of this malt liquor
1395,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.12,pale golden with a small pure white head that quickly shrinks away the smell is very solvent like grain alcohol with a sweet caramelized onion smell this shit is just bad metallic and way to hot with a sweet vegetal note that makes it unpalatable this is the worst malt liquor ive ever had a drain pour
1396,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.81,sent as part of the good bad and ugly 08 bif as per the conditions of the bif i must review and send an ugly beer here she be  dispensed from a 24oz can with a brick wall on the side enblazoned in spray paint graffitti the words four o street legal not sure of what street they are referring but whatever  pours a clear straw color with a very nice looking white head plenty of lacing and the head actually stays for quite a bit nice  aroma is corn cob and sweet liquor possibly some rice adjunct as well not a drop of grains but i wasnt expecting that from a malt liquor again not too bad so far  kind of sweet when it first hits the tougue then the rice cereals kick in a little bit of that alcohol gag comes up due to the sharpness and solvency of the alcohol kind of an old valentine day candy sort of taste to it a bit stale yet sweet and somewhat tolerable  i have to say this wasnt as bad as i was expecting a beer with graffitti on the label cant be that good but this wasnt all that bad of course i served this ice cold and as it warmed it became less and less drinkable but i cant say this is the worst beer i have had  pretty dry finish and candy alcohol in the finish as well overall sweet and alcoholic if i was really desperate i may have this by all means spend your money elsewhere
1397,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.96,received as part of a winter holidays gift of malt liquors from a friend who doesnt drink beer and thought this was something id like as hilariously misguided as the gift was i do appreciate trying something new and something id never buy on my own  pours a very clear corn husk yellow with a onefinger white head that sticks around a fair amount given the alcohol content fruity esters sweet dominate the nose perhaps its low expectations but the taste wasnt that bad clean and not as buttery as i am used to in my malt liquor travels but fruity in flavor and slightly buttery in texture and a very mild carbonation body is heavy with sweetness but not quite cloying one of the better malt liquors ive had but not something i want to encounter ever again in my life once is more than enough
1398,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.68,well its a struggle to know where to begin gotta love a can that tags itself pours like a beer syrup with little head that looks infected little deposits of bubbles at nucleation sites aroma of corn and cider hops like they ran past the mashtun with a hop cone at some point in the process medicinal and alcoholic taste is just as bad somehow i think of duvel what that is this is the opposite no sublety or grace or balance but oddly enough no worse to drink than the pbr i had last night theres something compelling about the big bruising flavor like a big dumb drunk that you enjoy listening to at the bar only because hes not picking on you and youre sure hes bound to pass out soon
1399,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.91,purchased a 24 oz can of four o at a liquor store in atlantic city nj the can was left in a hot car for a few hours to warm up the beer and give the aromatics a chance to shine  appearance pours a nice clear yellow with a solid fingerandahalf of foam that quickly dissolves away many streams of fine bubbles from the bottom of the glass  smell very corny a slight bitter element almost as if some of the metal from the can leeched into the beer aroma detected at least two feet away from glass not pleasant  taste for a beer with a cartoony graffiti landscape and the words street legal and 10 abv on the can it showed a surprising amount of sophistication there was a very strong corn taste with the harsh bitterness but lurking behind everything was a smooth cherry taste more like robitussin than maraschino but cherry nonetheless  mouthfeel the fizz just wouldnt stop stuck to my teeth and roof of my mouth not pleasant  drinkability i finished the 24 of 40 quite easily once i got past the first 8 oz of it the beers feel mellowed out once exposed to air the price wasnt right 155 plus tax but that notwithstanding this is an adequate malt liquor for well atlantic city
1400,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.5,40 ounces can courtesy of unclemattie poured a golden color beer with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing surprisingly aroma of fruity ester with some alcoholic phenols taste is not as bad as expected with some subtle adjunct and some fruit ester the alcohol is really noticeable and i guess can be expected from a 10 malt liquor medium body with some good carbonation this was definitely not as bad as expected but not something i would go for again thought
1401,Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.19,is it the hops or the hopping i like other fort points especially the citra ddh i bought this one for the low abv but it just doesnt measure up in flavor or feel
1402,Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.25,352020
1403,Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.9,146 yum
1404,Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.47,canned 12222 consumed 122622  i was surprised to see that trillium did a xmas drop in the chicagoland area of fresh hazy beers so i grabbed some as soon as i could for my holiday week i find that when someone can do a lower abv 66 with a lot of flavor that that is more an achievement than knocking out a dipa my pallet generally goes toward liking the higher abvs but i need the lower one once in awhile when having more than one beer in a sitting i am loving the balance in bitterness here more than anything the midwest brewers love to land on the sweeter side but i actually like the dryer bitter finishes more the beer does lack quite a bit on the nose as i am not getting much beyond some citrusy hop notes buried deep the feel is full and smooth overall a great beer i wish i had a fresh zombie dust to compare to see which would win for me
1405,Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.27,nice light fluffy pale ale i love this line of pale ales in general with the ddh being the best variant maybe due to having the ddh version first i really expected too much of this full disclosure this is very good one of the best pale ales ive had and packed with a lot of flavor for a relatively smaller abv and i do love galaxy hops  but this doesnt stand up to the ddh fort point
1406,ApriHop,2.38,the hops drown out any apricot flavor this stuff is horrible
1407,ApriHop,4.71,one of my favorite beers ever the dark almost caramel flavor of the apricot is a much better compliment to the ipa style that you might think a perfectly balanced beer and a great pickup if you can find it
1408,Samuel,4.9,2020 vintage at the brewery bottled  white head lace clear yellow gold color beautiful beer  a bit tart a bit citrusy but refreshing and balanced green apples white wine and grapes earthy wheat light saison spice but not like a belgian saison more subtle fruity but drinks like a white wine fairly dry but bubbly  very enjoyable and worth the hype cant believe i finally got to try this one
1409,Samuel,4.66,this is mild honeyed sweetness light lemony great funky and super smooth
1410,Samuel,4.73,b3 bottled 82720 poured from a 750ml bottle into a sp cheers stemmed wine glass pours a foggy orange with a fluffy white foam head foam dissipates but lingers as a thick white foam collar around the glass aromas of white wine lemon honey hay oak all in perfect harmony taste follows with a bright lemony tart finish full mouthfeel as it warms it takes on more white wine qualities pleasantly tart perfectly carbonated amazing beer
1411,Samuel,4.94,slightly foggy but bright yellow with a soft white head that retains well  insanely refreshing and softly effervescent up front it starts with melon and peach characteristics but then subsequent sips allow subtle farmhouse funk and oak to develop while even adding hints of passion fruit seed as it warms the mediumlight body then comes to a bone dry finish  batch 4    on the evening of march 10th 2023 i had the pleasure of enjoying a batch 2 bottle thanks to the contrite generosity of a long lost friend ultimately coming away enjoying it even more than b4  here an oaky funk pairs with an impressive array of stonefruits and pear accompanied by a beautiful bouquet of herbal accents including a hint of spearmint making for an absurdly unique yet ever delicate expression unlike b4 i do actually feel that i perceive the faintest hint of buckwheat here which provides a satisfying comfort in a small but substantial way  this beer exhibits such unbelievable balance and complexity that it may be their best barrel aged saison and i find myself increasing my already very high score of 476
1412,Modelo Especial Chelada,2.5,it tastes like a tomato flavored sprite a bit too rich for me id be curious to try it with a freshly cracked open modelo especial and the fixings added afterwards that would also bump the alcvol up from 35 to 44 the canned version will not be a repurchase for me  style fruit beer  tapcanbottle can  abv 35  rating 25
1413,Modelo Especial Chelada,4.64,this is a great summer beer to drink in the pool or river on a hot summer day especially between meals if you want to fancy line a pint glass with salt and lime slice perfect beer
1414,Modelo Especial Chelada,2.82,24 ounce can best by date of jul 2022 stamped on the bottom of the can served in a pint glass the beer pours a slightly hazy reddishamber color with about a half inch offwhite head that fizzled away quickly pretty much no lacing at all the brew smells like tomato juice and salt and thats about it taste is similar to the aroma but with the addition of some lime grainy malt and a slight weird bitter flavor i didnt care for it much at first but did get a little better as it warmed mouthfeelbody is light its easy enough to drink with a good amount of carbonation this is ok i guess but theres other chelada style beers id rather have but with that being said id drink this one again if someone gave me one
1415,Modelo Especial Chelada,1.47,24oz can served to me by socalled friends  this is an abomination no matter how you slice it but people seem to love it im not sure how to rate this because i truly hate it but it obviously has its place ive seen these chelada beers all over gives me gut rot heartburn and tastes like musty cheap beer and spoiled tomato juice  ugh
1416,Modelo Especial Chelada,4.06,it was very tasty
1417,Modelo Especial Chelada,3.02,tried this on a whim as i dont think i have ever had a chelada style beer drank from the 24oz can the beer smells and tastes like v8 which is to be expected with a slightly salty finish nothing much more to say i tried to find other notes but it was tomato all the way altogether not terrible but id rather have a bloody mary
1418,Modelo Especial Chelada,3,bought a 24oz can 325 foodland 122 days old or 4 months before best by month date stamp smell of lime and tomatoes reddish brown color high carbonation mediumheavy mouthfeel taste of tomato salt lime reminds me of a chilled tomato soup appetizer overall not bad first time drinking a chelada and it is better than i expected refreshing on a hot day good as a premeal drink
1419,Modelo Especial Chelada,2.71,my wife loves these things im still trying to learn her ways but this is marginally better than some of its peers i suppose brewed with natural and artificial flavors and sweeteners and whatever the hell certified color is sounds pretty fake to me and that kind of thing turns me off in beer shouldnt it just be tomato juice and some salt and lime i dont know but it doesnt taste bad murky reddish brown color to this no head at all but a lot of fizz and just a little sediment in the big can which was somewhat more expensive than anticipated not quite a budget beer it smells salty and citrus forward some acidity evident from the tomato and a natural enough lime essence maybe a hint of black pepper too but i dont get any real beer character in the aroma at all more like a bloody mary without the booze this is very low alcohol the flavor is okay salty and kind of cheap tasting at first but the tomato comes in nicely and there is a v8 juicy vibe to it it is a touch sweet and i wish that would go away but also i think the proportion of beer is a little light in here like i want more lager crispness coming through and i think this loses some refreshment capacity because its more the tomato juice than the beer that said ive had worse and even though this gets a little yucky as it warms its one of the lesser of the evils i reckon in this style nothing is ever going to beat making and blending your own but you can do a lot worse than this one ive heard from a trusted source that the limon is dynamite i need to track that one down
1420,Modelo Especial Chelada,2.98,straight out of the can rose red color heavy carbonation classic chelada strong lime salt tomato climate and a tinge of beer flavor pretty weak at 35 abv but that is to be expected for chelada i guess  my only gripe is i really cant drink much of the stuff it is incredibly salty goes great with some fish tacos though
1421,Sosus,3.66,22oz bottle  review from notes  ive been meaning to get my hands on this one a double ipa from one of my favorite ipamaking breweries and this doesnt disappoint with massive pine and floral notes smells and tastes like a bottle of pinesol  great stuff
1422,Sosus,3.9,a medium haziness of orange for coloring with a white soapy foam composition of one inch sticky strands of lacing strong carbonation factor  s really sweet sugary peaches watermelon and guava a bit of strawberrylemonade good strength has a bit of juicy gatorade flair  t dry flowery hopping citrus and orange grind with a bready malting  m bready malty consistency for mouthful  o overall loved the nose fruity and berry like fresh wet and gatorade like the flavor was a bit less impressing less complexed and basic
1423,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.68,now i understand this is what every rauchbier i have ever had has been trying to do campfire smoke malty brown bread caramel and molasses but not syrupy or burnt werthers and cellars i love this beer
1424,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.06,500ml bottle poured into tulip  pours a dark rootbeer brown with one finger of beige head that leaves a nice sheet of lace as it recedes  smells like beef jerky smoked meat garlic rosemary thyme onion burned bread and roasted caramel malt  tastes of pumpernickel blackened toast roasted caramel malt barbecue smoke some more subdued meat flavors and some cowboy coffee  feels deep and rich full bodied with subtle carbonation finishes chewy  verdict vigorously recommended a highly unusual but very enjoyable beer it would go pretty well with a steak or a burger or something
1425,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,5,deep dark rosy color with tan head that kept it to the bottom nose is medium with strong smoky almost acrid characteristics taste is deep and rich smoke wellbalanced mouthfeel is rich and creamy despite strong smokiness great beer
1426,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.19,smoked beer on steroids more intense finish than their other beers but the aroma is weaker excellent smoked rauchbier
1427,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.34,mahogany hue with a small sudsy head cured meat and campfire smoke aroma probably the strongest of the schlenkerla beers that ive tried mediumtofull bodied mouthfeel that was nicely carbonated tasted some caramel malts behind all that smokiness strong desire to barbeque something now long lasting lingering finish drinking this right after their fastenbier slight edge to the urbock
1428,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,3.87,this one really grew on me over the course of the bottle love me all the smoked meats but find smoke flavor offputting in a beverage this one smells and tasted deeply of smoke however its so wellcrafted and balanced by an absolutely delicious malt presence thats neither too sweet nor too bitter
1429,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.18,500 ml bottle  pours a clear dark chestnut brown in color thick cream colored head aroma is a wonderful balance of bready malts and savory woody smoke taste is similar although the smoke is more subdued in the taste medium bodied
1430,Oktoberfest,3.33,dark ambercopper appearance lots of carbonation off white head that faded within a minute muted malt sweet aroma taste followed the aroma not much depth albeit highly drinkable there are better marzens out there but this is okay given its lower price
1431,Oktoberfest,5,i really like this beer im not even a beer drinker i bought it for my mom as she is a yuengling drinker i was shockingly surprised at how much i liked it even mom loves it better than her standard yuengling flavor is smooth not bitter really nice texture and body highly recommend
1432,Oktoberfest,3.5,tasted like their traditional lager with a drop of samuel adams octoberfest added to each bottle and a 6pk is about the same price as one of yuenglings 12pks not the marzen you should settle for  style marzen  tapcanbottle bottle  abv 54  rating 35
1433,Oktoberfest,3.72,poured from a 12oz bottle into pint glass  dark amber in color what you would expect from an oktoberfest offering very little head maybe 18 of an inch which dissipates quickly no lacing look 375  understated notes of bread malt and caramel go well together but do not stand out smell 35  refreshing but fairly light for a seasonal offering of this kind a bit sweet and lacking in spice of other oktoberfests taste 375  very light in the beginning but starts to stick around longer after about 14 of the way through highly drinkable even if it is a bit on the lighter side feel 400  overall a pretty good oktoberfest offering could easily have a few of these in one sitting but it falls short of its closest highly available competitor the more flavorful sam adams overall 35
1434,Oktoberfest,4.75,this is as close to a traditional german oktoberfest beer as it gets without being in a german pub the only way it could be any better is if was served ontap or in a fest beer tent in germany ive had yuengling lager von fass at the brewery many years ago i was impressed then but wasnt with their bottled lager as brewed by miller the black  tan was an improvement but this oktoberfest really hit the mark this is the brew to serve at the oktoberfest in fredrickburg now im looking foward to trying their porter
1435,Oktoberfest,3.4,its alright prefer sam adams by a long shot good for gatherings for the price
1436,Oktoberfest,3.45,12 oz bottle into a becher glass l pours true clear amber caramel with a light and fizzy off white head that has zero retention steady carbo bubbles no lacing s caramel malts faint apple a hint of brown bread light raisin notes t taste follows aroma to the t adding background dark fruits very little aftertaste and sensing lightly sweet  zesty citrus and malt f brisk light  dry interestingly dry o very crushable and good tasting overall i enjoying it on a hot  steamy august day and it stays lively if you like lighter bodied beers this could be your friend it is good in its style
1437,Oktoberfest,2.64,i really like yuengling traditional so was excited to try this marzen style a little disappointed in the flavor i love oktoberfest beers but this one is not a fav of mine not as malty and light on pronounced flavor
1438,Oktoberfest,4.42,i get excited when i see the oktoberfest beers in the stores it means football season is close so far shiner was first in stores here in sotex drank my fair share walked i to heb and what did i see yuengling oktoberfesthell yeah  havent had it yet yuengling hasnt been sold in texas for too long damn i love this its one of the easiest drinking oktoberfest beers smells great tastes great no beer snob review just a dumb good beer good work yuengling
1439,Oktoberfest,3.69,picked up a 6 pack of bottles out of the beer cave at oncue on broadway in edmond ok oncue is a clone of the beloved tulsabased cstore called quiktrip it was not stocked had to open a case to get to it fortunately it was already entered into the pos system and they could ring it up  appearance clear copperamber with frothy buff head that lasts  aroma marzen without the umlaut smells more american toasty bready malts with hints of caramel and nuts light floralgrassy hops  flavor clean and crisp not overly sweet and with a decent noble hop balance still does not have the nuance of a german version  mouthfeel light to medium feels a lot like other yuenglings  overall a respectable american ofest not complicated and has familiar and welcome characteristics  ps i contrasted this with their flagship traditional lager and this tastes more nuanced and cleaner id rather the traditional lager tasted like this  but unfortunately an allmalt m√§rzen costs more to make
1440,Oktoberfest,3.4,poured from a bottle a deeper amber in color with a small head smells of malt dark caramel and dark fruit starts with a dark caramel flavor that lightens into a malty nutty flavor decent marzen
1441,Oktoberfest,3.38,poured from a bottle into a dfh shaped pint glass  the beer pours a clear copper color with a fluffy beigekhaki head that dissipated quickly leaving behind very little acing  the aroma is typical of the american versions of this style mostly sweet with some bready malts and crackers there is also a generic hoppyness  the flavor has a caramel sweetness with notes of crackers and dark bread there is also a hint of spicy hops light bodied and moderately carbonated  overall this is a dumbed down version of the style quite drinkable but not terribly interesting
1442,Oktoberfest,4.69,looks like a typical oktoberfest beer smell was of biscuits and flowers just lovely taste was smooth and creamy just the right amount of sweetness mouthfeel was a little sticky overall a great choice i have tried a lot of oktoberfest beers and this is one of the better ones definitely worth a try
1443,Oktoberfest,3.48,12oz bottle poured out a clear golden amber color with a small offwhite head of foam it left minimal lacing on the glass it smelled of caramel toffee and floral notes sweet caramel and bready malt backbone with a mild bitterness
1444,Oktoberfest,2.96,went to a wedding and the choices were this and bud ugh liked this better than their usual lager and waaay better than bud a little sweeter and more flavorful than regular yuengling wouldnt search for this but it was drinkable better than i expected
1445,Hop Wallop,4.5,reminded of this beer by the how many beers of fame have you reviewed post surprised that i have not reviewed this before have probably had a case of this miss this beer
1446,Hop Wallop,3.96,a smooth drinking ipa that pours into a gorgeous golden haze with about a 2 inch white frothy head the head lingers for a while in the glass which is great the beer gives off wonderful hoppyearthy aromas with a tropical twist the taste follows the nose giving pine and floral like notes but with some tropical fruit notes too this definitely packs a wallop at 75 but does drinks more like a session could definitely have more than one but i would not advise as the alcohol could sneak up on you enjoy the drinkability and smoothness of this wonderfully crafted ipa
1447,Hop Wallop,4.85,ive been saving this bottle for a few years only to pull it out after a hop devil it is still one of my favorites great flavor color nose and flavor victory excels again
1448,Hop Wallop,3.47,appearance liquid gold pure clean and translucent looks like an ale youd expect to see in the tavern of a great dwarven kingdom just dont drink too deeply or too greedily puffs up a layer of choppy white foam that disappears after introductions are over living on only as a pattern of sticky striated lacing  bouquet floral earthy notes but their aroma is dainty and distant like flowers far away on a mountain traces of dried pine occasionally waft in on that faroff mountain breeze pleasant but falls profoundly short of being impressive  feel a cold babbling brook of bubbles cascade gently on this lightbodied ale crisp with a dry tangy finish that promises to linger but ends up dipping out early  taste bright semisweet pine quiet notes of pepper and a wisp of lemongrass all stand before a crackery malt backbone  overall meh its pleasing refreshing and theres nothing wrong with it but its meek and doesnt add anything new to the genre a serviceable middleoftheroad ipa thatll never stand out but sometimes thats just what the menu calls for
1449,Hop Wallop,4.28,pours golden yellow with a 2 inch white head with good retention heavy lacing to end  strong aroma of pine grapefruit earthy floral  taste is resiny pine slight spiciness including pepper  medium bodied light carbonation dry bitter finish  this is a damn good ipa one of the best
1450,Hop Wallop,3.83,had this several times before my dad gave me a 6er about two weeks ago i have one of these left but here are my thoughts now poured into a tulip the appearance was a semidark yellow branded color with some transparency about it some carbonation seem rising at a modest pace lace coats in a semidusty way but clingy the aroma had a strong citrusy pithybitter rind character strolling in for a balance with some bitter piney hop tones malts seem barely there the flavor leaned towards the bitter side with a touch of sweet pine dry needles arranging underneath mild pine tree aftertaste fairly dry the mouthfeel was pretty dry running along my tongue holding its own as its scraping like what i remember of old school ipasdipas sturdy carbonation and good for the style sure is a sipper finishes bitter through dry pine tree notesdry overall not for the faint of heart this is what old school dipas seem to have started out as this is one i would come back to preferably for me
1451,All Hallows Treat,4.61,l pours jet black with light quickly dissipating head out of a 16 oz can little to no lacing s unmistakable peanut butter with soft chocolate and alcohol in the background t chololate peanut butter with some light banana ester flavors are present here similar to a really good trappist ale but with some extra fun f medium light carbonation my only complaint is that this beer could use a bit more carb to retain some head o maybe my favorite beer ive had in the flavored stout realm this beer really delivers on what was advertised
1452,All Hallows Treat,3.84,for those who think that you have to give up the childhood treats for craft beer brewery ommegang has some news for you applying a light coat of chocolate and peanut butter onto a belgianstyled stout gives us a little more treat and a much less trick  dark and rusty garnet all hallows treat comes with a yeasty fogginess and a heady tarnish froth as the scent of fruit and chocolate come first the undercurrents of peanut vinous spice and deep caramelization provides a complex and balanced aroma sweet with brown sugar hard candy and chocolate the early palate shares a malty balance with a sugary coat of spice cake  as the ale rolls along the middle palate the fruit flavors of cherry date fig and raisin links up with a near piespice medley of cinnamon allspice clove and ginger for that quintessential beglain balance but then the chocolate and peanut come together in a buttercup way especially with the lingering candied sweetness that leads to a vinous peppery and woodsy taste late on the palate  full bodied and maltydry overall the beer carries a drying and relaxed sense of maltiness with hints of cola and coffee into a long aftertaste redolent with red wine and spiced rum
1453,All Hallows Treat,3.89,purchased as part of a build your own  4 pack from wegmans in collegeville pa purchased on 82823 two dates on the bottom of the can 71723 which is the canned date and 21224  l pitch black  s robust peanut butter and subtle dark chocolate aroma  t bitter dark chocolate faint peanut butter flavor  f quite thin mouthfeel moderate carbonation  o a good imperial stout the aroma is better than the flavor but still enjoyable
1454,All Hallows Treat,3.94,aroma is peanut butter chocolate and slightly earthy dark malts the flavor is fruitmild raspberriescherries dark malts and a mildly sweet chocolatepeanut butter finish
1455,All Hallows Treat,4.15,not much to look atblack with a little shortlived head no lacing chocolate and vanilla on nose with a hint of peanut butter the flavor is where this shines same as nose but really amped up without tasting like fake chemical additions moderate to heavyish body but leaving a clean mouth feel
1456,All Hallows Treat,3.84,ommegang all hallows treat imperial stout 76 abv pours black with a slight head that dissipated quickly nose is slight peanut butter and chocolate taste follows slightly sweet moderately bitter decent mouthfeel overall very good
1457,All Hallows Treat,3.96,black in color with a fingernail of beige around nearly all of the rim theres also just a trace of it elsewhere on top the aroma is of a lot of peanut butter and some milk chocolate im tasting peanut butter and milk chocolate the mouth is dry and viscous
1458,All Hallows Treat,3.91,pours dark thin foam heavy pb aroma tasty pb and chocolate body not too sweet good flavor could be smoother i wouldnt call this imperial at 76 but its worth a try
1459,All Hallows Treat,4.43,love this one sweet balanced cocoa chocolate sweet peanut butter very balanced hops not dry in the slightest dark sweet easy drinking hope to find it again
1460,Tripel,4.58,poured from a 330ml bottle  pours a slightly hazy golden straw with a huge  domed white head and only a little visible carbonation the smell is of mellow yeast and slight banana and the taste follows on from this whilst adding notes of toffee malt  bread fruitiness and a medium bitterness everything is very well rounded together the mouthfeel is thick without being syrupy subtle prickly carbonation and a warmth from the alcohol overall a great beer subtle complicatedrich without being overpowering one i think id notice different things on on different occasions 
1461,Tripel,4.19,absolutely beautiful pour gold amber big foamy head that lasts well instant sweet esters and yeast with some banana aromas too taste follows now with nice carbonation and a sweet dry finish almost like a dessert wine finish lovely and complex triple really enjoyed it

1463,Tripel,4.3,aroma is your typical belgian bananaestermalt and the body is an excellent example of what usually comes after a bright refreshing wave of banana clove honey and malt with delightful and refreshing carbonation a delicious exemplar of the belgian tripel
1464,Tripel,4.46,112 oz bottle from a mix 4pk exp date 010624 into a watou chalice l pours clouded apricot orange with a very thin white head that is a skin low carbonation no lacing s banana bread clove a hint of rum gains more hop aroma with light warming t fruity banana bread light clove yeast a hint of citrus zest white pepper a suggestion of grains wheat distant cork it is gently sweet f gently brisk lightly juicy mediumlight body with a fairly fast  dry finish becomes more smooth with warming yet retains a light  bright fizz o i rolled the bottle to get some sediment into the pour and it was a very slow pour that produced no head this was on purpose the beer is lively and foams over if poured quickly esp into the correct chalice this affects lacing as well nice to have the option overall a beautiful tasting and drinking beer most certainly a sipper and has a classic belgian taste  feel no noticeable traces of alcohol yet it is lightly warming it is outstanding in its style

1467,Tripel,4.28,shared 750ml bottle into a teku dating difficult to interpret  excellent looking beer glowing golden body with a strong white head leaving streaks of lacing slightly musty aroma but such a good taste sweetness some spice notes slightly drying mouth full finish sweet then dry lovely drink

1469,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.34,appearance dark red good sized pink head  smell cherries tartness  taste nice sweet cherry flavor with a bit of tartness a little syrupy feel  overall picked up at the source in new glarus im not a fruit beer guy but this was quite tasty the cherry flavor was more on the sweet side than tart or sour so that was a plus in my book might even have to get a 4 pack sometime
1470,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.65,12 oz bottle obtained at the brewery two days ago poured into a clear plastic cup  compared to the raspberry tart i found much more clarity and brightness in this liquid foam built on the pour but didnt persist long on the nose cherry cordial pie cherries bold and in 3d on the palate piecherry heering but not syrupy sweet a flanders red character slowly creeps up in the aftertaste over each sip never subtly malty but the dominant flavor is otherwise pie cherries the balance this maintains in drinkability is remarkable clean and almost crisp despite suggesting syrupy residuals its body sports a lithe drawn out curvature another spectacular acheivement on their part mesmerizing and moreish another i havent had in 9 years  glad i have some left 2187
1471,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.79,drink it and you can see its world class ranking perfect cherry brew exploding with taste
1472,Wisconsin Belgian Red,5,as perfect a beer as you could find the door county cherries are as delicious in alcoholic form as they are in pies or raw the deep red color mirrors the incredible aroma and full flavor of this champion
1473,Wisconsin Belgian Red,5,i might be biased since a won a beer vs wine dinner with this beer on my dessert course you can tell they somehow get 16 cherries into this bottle and not in a bad way its a little fizzy on your lips during the entire experience from the carbonation this is the most unique tasting beer ive had the chance to drink its thickness is enjoyable since it doesnt stick to the inside of your mouth everyone should make the drive to wisconsin to enjoy this beer
1474,Wisconsin Belgian Red,3.5,good beer but too sweet needs a higher abv than 4 for the 4pk price a little to cough medicine taste
1475,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.84,the perfect mix of sweet and tart its way better than sam adams cherry wheat
1476,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.05,great cherr ale slightly sweet great drinking
1477,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.03,friend of mine went to wisconsin and brought this back poured into a snifter as recommended and immediately caught the whiff of the cherries this followed with the sweet and tart flavor of cherry and some hint of the bitterness on the finish expected more of the oak like a cabernet but none to be found overall a great beer for its kind
1478,Shiner Bock,4.44,a fantastic brew when had fresh on tap in season does not age well in the bottle though drink it fresh and you get saison qualities a staple quality beer from my part of the country oklahoma
1479,Shiner Bock,3.36,i tried a pint of this beer off the tapper at the united club at the houston texas airport it poured a clear copper with fizzy white head that eventually dissapates and leaves no lace the scent had german malt and grain presence the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with semi sweet german bock malt base with grain presence the mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation overall it is a good beer
1480,Shiner Bock,1.42,choked one down tastes like soy sauce left in the heat over watery and smells like an old boot i couldnt even finish the whole thing mouthfeel is like sandpaper
1481,Shiner Bock,3,overpriced swill dont buy thats what i think
1482,Shiner Bock,1.7,bad watery flavorless tasteless thats all i have to say cant find 150 words to say mediocre but at 103 i have to repeat watery flavorless thats it ive reached 150
1483,Shiner Bock,3,tastes like the tap water version of michelob amberbock not a repurchase the drill sergeant from full metal jacket might have been right about a few things is all im saying  style bock  tapcanbottle bottle  abv 45  rating 3
1484,Shiner Bock,4.89,it kind of reminds me of coca cola but without all the sugar  its one of my go to beers for flavor and taste
1485,Shiner Bock,3.85,if you hate on shiner you are probably 1 young 2 not from texas 3 use beer reviews to feel better about your sorry life compared to todays brews it is certainly underwhelming and not particularly complex for those of you living in austin in the early 90s well before it became an unrecognizable doppelg√§nger of itself shiner was the best thing around the revenge of the nerds of beers  dated but better than a lot of stuff that comes out in 2023 the eternal foil to aals
1486,Redd's Apple Ale,3.8,very good if you think about it asalcoholic beverage not so much as a beer in feeltaste i prefer drinking this apple ale to most hard ciders and its great in the fall or on a summer evening
1487,Redd's Apple Ale,1,too sweet cant taste any hops or malt whatsoever
1488,Redd's Apple Ale,3.71,almost like an apple flavored mikes hard lemonade
1489,Redd's Apple Ale,4.8,why redds doesnt sell as well as angry orchard is beyond me has anyone actually bothered to sit down and try this not only does redds actually have an apple taste to it but its smooth crisp and refreshing just keep it refrigerated overnight put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes and youre in hard cider heaven  seriously angry orchard is so watered down compared to redds
1490,Redd's Apple Ale,2,de color dorado con una espuma jabonosa de poca retenci√≥n cuerpo ligero y carbonataci√≥n media aroma manzana verde y algo de cereal en boca tiene notas dulces y un final levemente √°cido
1491,Bl√•b√¶r Lambik,4.35,pours crystal clear dark ruby with almost purple hues 2 fingers of dense pink tinged head builds and hangs around forever an essentially perfect appearing beer aroma has a huge minerality only mild lactic tartness subtle pungent funk not much fruit taste is burnt plastic like funk some bitterness moderate tart sourness blueberries are subtle i poured the sedimentation in a separate mini glass it has huge blueberry aromas and was much sweeter and richer a blueberry cobbler character almost the taste was a little more tart and a little more blueberry forward but still not a ton ok back to the main pour as it warms it opens up a bit like a good wine fruit comes out a bit and lactic acidity builds but still never reaches the mouth puckering tartness of most cantillons its very clean crispy even with a high but appropriate carbonation and very good drinkability overall a very nice beer is it worth the hypehoops one needs to jump through to obtain it the short answer is probably no but hell it was fun anyways  5425425475425
1492,Bl√•b√¶r Lambik,4,bottle rbesg 2007 in glasgow grand tasting hazy deep red colour distinct aroma of blueberries and ripe raspberries also some woody notes very sour flavour lemon and blueberry notes quite good
1493,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,5,it has been 29 years since i had the last taste of this beer but i remember it like it was yesterday when i first tasted it i thought at the time it was the best beer i had ever had up to that point and after all these year it is still the best beer i have ever had while i was stationed in germany i spent many many marks on this beer best money i ever spent been around the globe and have drank countless different beers from many different countries and i have not found a beer that i enjoy more that this one the color of this beer is warm and relaxing the feel of the beer is smooth and silky not watery or thick the smell is somewhat sweet caramelly and the taste is a little sweet although not sugary sweet mellow leaving a very pleasant aftertaste that slowly fades away
1494,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,4.95,the absolute best beer i ever had the opportunity to have my portfolio of beers have 687 different beers of all styles i wish i could get this in the states
1495,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,4.42,1660 euros for the one liter growler and one liter of beer at the kloster reviewed 102318 capped bottle marked mindestens haltbar bis 240419 on the front label prefilled and stored in a reefer at the kloster stored on my window sill at 51 degrees and consumed at the same temperature from a hand washed and dried glass coffee mug appearance  4 body  medium amber clear head  large maximum 45 cm aggressive center pour offwhite creamy good retention diminishing to a three mm ring and complete layer lacing  very good  multiple partial rings of tiny bubbles some connected by columns and some having stalactites first pour  medium amber hazy aroma  45  caramel malt flavor  45  less caramel and more malt than the nose slightly sweet no hops no alcohol 49  abv no diacetyl no dimethylsulfide palate  4  less than medium creamy soft carbonation impression and interpretation  45  an excellent dunkel possibly the best ive ever had id had it vom fass while visiting and attempted to buy one of the fascinating 1 liter growlers as a souvenir  imagine my joy when i found it came filled with beer
1496,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,4.66,i drank it on a trip to the monastery when staitioned in fulda for the 411th acr it was one of the best drunkel beirs ive ever drank love it
1497,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,4.85,my very favorite bier ive only drunk this brew at the monastery the bier itself is worth a trip i was stationed about an hour away from there when i was with the 11th cavalry and i have had many daytrips there for great times with friends and for the chance to taste the best imho products of german brewmasters
1498,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,5,
1499,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,4.38,visiting my son and daughterinlaw in germany we took a day trip to the kreuzberg monastery for lunch and beer bought a very cool growler to bring home filled with beer of course the monastery sits on top of a mountain and has beautiful views  one of the smoothest drinkable beers in germany great aftertaste
1500,Interlude,4.22,bottled april 2022  yet another bottle i grabbed when me and my buddy did the cellar tour there last month on paper red wine barrel aging and mixed fermentation is everything i want in a saison but this is a style for me that needs to do a lot to impress me that being said i trust allagash to deliver though so im excited to try it  pours a slightly cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  theres really not too much funk in the nose but the earthy vibe is still keeping me intrigued im picking up on aromas of bready malt tannic red wine wildflower honey stone wet hay lemon yogurt light earthy hops and pear skin  its sharper up front in taste which i appreciate but returns to the yeasty vibe on the back end on the front end of the sip im tasting tart red grape lemon juice doughy malt earthy wheat sharp oak honey tart plum and pear skin the swallow brings notes of earthy wheat wildflower honey lemon yogurt stone wet hay bready malt and tannic red wine  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a tannic and beer finishes dry with a great balance  this is really solid stuff its not quite as funky as i prefer for the stylr but its close plus for what it is allagash killed it
1501,Interlude,4.6,3000th beer rating on ba  2012 bottle 95 cork and cage 750 ml bottle drank out of a bulbous wine glass on 122321 just spectacular
1502,Interlude,4.46,2016 vintage
1503,Interlude,3.91,shared 750 ml corked bottle at local tasting vintage 2007 bought at √∏lbutikken or h√∏keren copenhagen may 2011 ale aged in oak barrels abv is 95 clear orange colour moderate white head aroma of brettanomyces sour fruits and apple cider vinegar medium sour flavour brettanomyces galore woody finish decent hops interesting and unusual
1504,Interlude,3.39,what is this a double saison 104 and a 424 average this outta be interesting  pours a darker color than almost any saison guessing this took some barrel notes with it to the extent that it literally turned the saison beer darker or maybe its just a maltyboi or both anyways its this mixture of dark amber and brown not much for head retention maybe 14 white at its peak but really settles a lot less than that the aroma had more of a belgian quad than it did saison vibe but there was a bit of fruitcake like breadiness in the nose seems this one has an ample amount of brett characternose  taste brings all the dark fruit in the world into a beer with no dark fruit no doubt the wine barrel brings a lot of that but also this belgian yeast that doesnt seem like a saison yeast at all more qua bspa or bdsa mouth feel has a grip load of alcohol heat to it not something i want in a saison but this isnt much of a saison its more like a wine barrel aged quad not sure i really get this saison
1505,Interlude,4.46,2017 vintage poured from a corkncage bomber into a dogfish head tulip  l cloudy pour brownamber color looks like apple cider with thin fizzybarely there head modest ring of lacing  s tart and fruity red wine and the cellar its stored in  tf modestly tart red wine and oak grape must funk and plum dark fruits leather baking cherry and black pepper medium bodied light carbonation and sticky on the tongue complex more red wine and fruit to finish  o an absolutely fantastic redwine barrel aged brew great complexity and flavor easy drinking despite some tartness and brett outstanding
1506,Interlude,4.6,bottled on 072716  notes of funky red wine oak barrel mild leather slight acetic vinegar barnyard farmhouse hay straw spice toasted bready malts graham cracker caramel toffee vanilla dried fruit tart apple pear apricot cherry plum pineapple with floral earthy herbal hops
1507,Ichnusa,1.91,best before 022024 classic smell of industrial beer on the nose only malts and cereals especially corn very clear straw very clean very filtered nice foam hat in the mouth effervescent liquid without soul classic industrial product based on maize and with a contribution of hops reduced to a minimum both in terms of taste and above all in terms of bitterness just enough body not to be called watery and always active carbonation malted part that prevails but does not give a real defined taste slight hint of corn in the aftertaste and nothing else beer for mass consumption soulless
1508,Ichnusa,2.45,nice light taste but there are other beers i would buy again
1509,Ichnusa,3.53,i tried this beer a few days ago when i arrived in rome poured from a brown 223 oz bottle has a straw color with a 12 inch head smell is of malts a touch skunky taste is strong of malts and grains refreshing feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer
1510,Ichnusa,3.23,330ml bottle poured into la chouffe tulip  a golden clear medium sized head which hung around for a bit and left some lacing  s other than a small hint of malt there wasnt much to report  t malty slight notes of corn and grain  m crisp texture moderate carbonation  o typical southern european pale lager not bad for what it was but not exciting or memorable
1511,Ichnusa,1.83,cerveza ligera de carbonataci√≥n media con una cabeza espumosa de poca retenci√≥n aromas d√©biles a malta y ma√≠z en boca es plana sin llegar a destacar ning√∫n ingrediente
1512,Ichnusa,2.68,from a large bottle obtained in cagliari sardinia clear golden color with white head smells of grain light feel and moderate carbonation light grain and straw flavors with some grassy hops had this on a hot day accompanied by pizza and it was pretty enjoyable but on its own its a pretty generic euro lager
1513,Ichnusa,3.15,looks thin smells bready tastes relatively okay but with slightly sharp almost annoying carbonation and a bit strange sticky bitter aftertaste anima sarda  sardinian soul stands on the label i hope there was one originally before heineken
1514,Dirty Bastard,4,strong dark fruit flavors with roasted bitterness
1515,Dirty Bastard,3.73,interesting flavor but i might be a wee lad wonder how thisd pair with a glass of scotch whisky i think itd go well probably
1516,Dirty Bastard,2.93,real thick hazy caramel color with some stained fizz head all plump like a biscuit it doesnt smell like much to me right now but my nose is a tad stuffy tastes like the left side of a boot sole you can really see what they mean by dirty bastard its heavy and strong and it hits you hard with those delayed hops but i dunno founders historically hasnt done a lot for me and i cant say that the dirty bastard changed my mind reminds me of a post christmas december evening right when its really starting to snow and you get home from work after dark and youre a little glum from the holiday season being over and then you notice that the wet snow has soaked into your parka i would say that wet snow in clothes is the best descriptor for this one not entirely bad
1517,Dirty Bastard,4.5,im reviewing this for the style of dark thick string beer which this is its resinous and sticky and thick and taste like caramel raisins if i wanted to sip a darker thick boy of a beer slowly this is great  i usually like to throw back beers though so i probably wont be drinking this one too often but its a great beer id have at a restaurant if i only wanted to order one this would pair well with a juicy steak
1518,Dirty Bastard,3.79,early rating was a bit rough a much better beer nonrefrigerated i do get some of the peaty taste more of the alcohol at the bottom refriged it had like zero smell or body im enjoying it much better getting more of the taste at room temp
1519,Dirty Bastard,4.04,on tap at the brewery  appearance medium dark brown very small light tan head that lingered leaving some lacing  nose a little peat a bit of cooked sugar sweetness  mouthfeel smooth medium heavy adequate carbonation  attack toasted malt light sweetness  finish balancing bitterness  overall a very good scotch ale doesnt have quite the bang of the barrelaged backwoods but solid
1520,Dirty Bastard,4.1,a awesome rich mahogany brownish head espresso  stoasted malt reminiscent of a brown ale dark fruit dates iron  t toffee rich malt character candied fruit leather  m good  o rich nuanced light a quad and a barley wine had a bastard baby very good
1521,Dirty Bastard,4.5,i have had a few other scotch ales and they tended to be heavier and sweeter this one pour amberdark and has a nice head it smells of malt and a bit of alcohol the flavor is spot on one of the best scotch ales i have ever tried if you are looking for one of the best scotch ales this is it
1522,Dirty Bastard,4.65,one of my favorites for cool or cold days the taste is caramel warms me up inside would love to have it on tap but for now in north texas the bottle is all i have i can find it in most stores
1523,Dirty Bastard,3.68,look dark red 1 finger head  smell toffee with a hint of malt  taste tasty sweet not what i was expecting at all but its super good  feel lingers in your mouth for a minute  overall very good very surprising beer
1524,Dirty Bastard,3.89,yearround release  6 pack 12 oz bottle dated 011223  85 abv  50 ibu brewed and bottled in grand rapids mi poured into a bells branded nonic pint glass  look  pours a thick and fluffy tan colored head that leaves lacing slightly clear dark reddish amber appearance smell  the scent is sweet toffee roasted malt caramel dark cherry no scent of alcohol taste  the taste follows the nose with sweet toffee being the most dominate not really getting any hop taste other than a slight bitterness in the aftertaste the alcohol is undetectable feel  medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel and finishes very dry overall  the sweet toffee flavor kinda borders on overpowering making this pretty unbalanced and almost cloyingly sweet
1525,Red Stripe Light,1.23,drainpour
1526,Red Stripe Light,2.91,drank for 7 straight days in jamaica perfect abv and feel for the setting the resort also had miller lite which i do not drink often i did a side by side between the two while floating on a raft in the caribbean the red stripe light was superior to the miller light in terms of smell taste and feel more hop presence and a nice bready backbone ill probably never drink it outside of my occasional trips to the island by for 7 days it did me well
1527,Red Stripe Light,2.42,1 single from the aforementioned gas station usually dont buy light lagers under any circumstance buttttt gotta try em all  pours a dehydrated piss yellow with a large bone white head as expected carbonation is heavy lacing is pretty decent at the end of the swill  smells like your typical light lager though red stripe has also been far more corn forward in my opinion  taste follows suit super corny with a mildy bitter lime presence for whatever reason  feel is light and watery as youd expect but it swallows easy and luckily it has no skunk  overall i assume this was 1 because it was old and didnt sell or perhaps others from the pack had broken dunno but for 1 there isnt much to complain about there are better adjunct lagers out there
1528,Red Stripe Light,3.36,had a few everyday for six straight days wile on my honeymoon in jamaica very light yellow color when poured very light in the mouthfeel very easy to drink and with the 36abv it was perfect to sip on all day and i will be drinking again if i make it back to jamaica
1529,Red Stripe Light,2.11,again go for the rum
1530,Beelzebub,4.71,a pours a motor oil black with a thick brown head with solid retention and lacing s roasted notes with hints of earthy hops t meaty roasted porter notes with surprisingly balancing earthy hop notes subtle sweet alcohol notes m silky smooth o very well balanced beer excellent
1531,Beelzebub,3.85,black with two fingers of mocha head big air bubbles lead to quick dissipation soap bubble lacing  chocolate coffee and pine in the nose  taste is similar chocolate strong umami some sugared coffee light pine and dry finish bitter aftertaste  medium bodied slick feel with restrained carbonation  solid beer but to my taste the dryness distracts a bit from the lovely piney bitterness
1532,Beelzebub,4.4,16 oz can poured into a tulip  a black with a two finger mocha head  s dark chocolate roasted malts earthy hops hints of citrus some char  t dark chocolate roasted malts pineyearthy some char touch of the citra dry hopping  m smooth full body  o a well done stout and it aged gracefully i think i got this in a box of beer in 2017 or 2018 and i just forgot to drink it right away but have no issue with what time has done to this beer
1533,Beelzebub,5,from can into tulip glass amazing aroma of hops as soon as i poured it taste is all stout with chocolate and cocoa an unbelievable combo of a strong stout but with hops in background great beer
1534,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.46,bottom line this is a delectable pastry stout worthy of angry chairs lofty reputation they simply seem to have mastered some sort of alchemy regarding the style that few if any can match  its perhaps not a dead ringer for the namesake dessert  but it honestly isnt far off and the resemblance grows with successive sips its sweet but not cloying realistically its more rich and decadent than sweet the coconut is a lovely light touch never overbearing but adding another layer to the profile chocolate and vanilla are prominent joined by molasses cherry and caramel from the malt base incredibly long finish including lingering notes of coffee chocolate and vanilla  this is another absolute home run from angry chair every single time i have one of their highestrated pastry stouts i think theres absolutely no way it can possibly live up to the hype  and then it not only matches but surpasses the hype
1535,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.42,from a 32oz crowler filled at the brewery 060323 served in a tulip  pours a thickandviscous appearing motor oil black a scant quarterfinger of coffeecolored suds lasts a halfminute or so leaving a soft creamy collar and a barely rousable oily sugary film of superslippery lacing  nose is roastymalty nutty and mildly sweet aromas of fudge and dark roast coffee some nuttiness and woody husky coconut as it warms  taste is fudgysweet  but much less sweetness than anticipated tasting brown sugar chocolate vanilla fudge molassessweetened coffee and  more prominently and notably as the beer warms  an earthy woody nuttiness ground bitter walnut thick and heavy perfumy vanilla and husky coconut nice alcohol is hardly noticeable  feel is smooth and viscous dense but less thick and heavy than it appeared going into the glass with superfine prickly carbonation making it feel a little lighter than it might otherwise i want to say that it feels sugary like sugar water but thats totally hallucinatory  it tastes like it should feel sugary but it does not abv is hardly evident  overall outstanding i like to buy these sweet and sticky pastry stouts mainly so that i can complain about them and leave bad reviews but this was so damn good that i was wishing i hadnt offered to share it with boy and spouse mammosilenus who never likes stouts stole several ounces of this and then came back looking for more and had to be beaten back
1536,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.53,such an awesome beer like most of angry chairs stouts this thing coated the glass with sugar making it difficult to hold without developing sticky fingers this is offset completely by the delicious deep chocolate nose and palette with boozy sweetness grabbing hold and a light aftertaste of vanilla
1537,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.19,dark black little to no head imperial german chocolate cupcake stout is super sweet and not my favorite kind of stout this needs the barrel its tasty  i split this 4 ways so still got about 6oz and it was probably 3oz too many total dessert stout good for what what it is  not for me
1538,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.5,sampled 1182019 while in line at toppling goliath chocolate greatness
1539,Dortmunder Gold,4.38,sampling a 12 oz bottle poured into my 5l dimple mug at cellar temp 6172023 date stamp on the label the beer pours a clear copper color with a few lazy streams of carbonation rising to the surface there is a foaming soft eggshell white head of 2 cm this foam fades quickly to a thin edge layer and leaves very scattered lattice when i take a sip or swirl the mug aroma is a big of caramel and toasted bread with hints of biscuit as well i do get some spicy hops and maybe tea note as well overall the nose is kind of mild but also complex first sip reveals a light to medium body with smooth texture and gentle carbonation very easy drinker as would be expected for the beer and this style flavor is toasted grains and biscuity malt with some spicy hop and black tea again this lingers briefly after the swallow a nice easy drinking yet flavorful beer glad to have finally posted this review
1540,Dortmunder Gold,4.21,on tap at great lakes  while visiting cleveland for my first time i couldnt pasa up the opportunity to come to the legendary great lakes and naturally i had to start off with the worlds highest rated dortmunder lager lets see what its all about  pours a mostly clear copper gold with 2 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  the nose is gentle but very well balanced im picking up on aromas of biscuity malt earthy hops black tea black pepper toffee light honey and raw grain  and its very similar in taste but thats fine by me on the front end of the sip im tasting bready malt black tea herbal hops toffee raw grain and light white pepper the swallow brings notes of biscuity malt herbal hops toffee black tea black pepper raw grain and light orange zest  a light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth and crisp beer finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness  this is damn solid i havent had a dortmunder in a while so im goad to have this one of all of them
1541,Dortmunder Gold,3.44,great looking beer with little head staying power is about the best i can say about this brew now its not that the rest of it was bad it was just mostly alsoran i just found it to be a bit metallic tasting and the smell was just not there still a decent brew not one i will go out of my way for
1542,Dortmunder Gold,4.1,pours a crystalclear ambergold with a thick white cap nice lacing aroma is roasted malt biscuit grassy hops flavor follows the nose sweet up front with a bit of noble hop bitterness in the finish feel is medium bodied with good carbonation overall a fantastic beer
1543,Dortmunder Gold,3.84,5123 ford from a 12 oz can purchased from the washington beer store  very little lacing or much head  aroma is sweet malt right up front slight citrus as well  taste is definitely lager sweet cracker dry hoppiness comes through
1544,Dortmunder Gold,4.32,poured into a stein from a 12oz can well within its date range  appearance dark golden with a massive offwhite head that dissipated gradually leaving nice lacing  nose pleasant toasted malt  mouthfeel medium which was pleasantly heavier than id anticipated  attack plenty of malt balanced with hop bitterness  finish hop bitterness lingers but doesnt approach astringency  this fine lager deserves every bit of its many awards and its 1 ranking in its style true to style heavier and more flavor intense than many lagers
1545,Dortmunder Gold,4.43,pours a crystalclear gold with a foamy white head and good lacing very bright herbal and hay like aroma toasty cracker and sweet bread dough the taste is spicy herbal and fresh with a toastybready malt backbone moderate body and clean drying finish very flavorful and quaffable i dont really know exactly what a dortmunderstyle lager is supposed to taste like but this is worldclass beer
1546,Spotted Cow,4,a slight haze medium gold in color 1 finger finely pored ivory head that receded to a wispy cap nice lacing  s funky lemon orange and clove  t yeast driven flavor that follows the nose mild to moderate bitterness at the end  m light to medium bodied moderate carbonation moderately dry finish  o very enjoyable easy drinking refreshing would pair well with a wide variety of foods
1547,Spotted Cow,4.45,a perennial favorite this has a nice robust flavor while still maintaining a certain lightness to the beer if youre not expecting the bottle conditioning the yeast you find in the bottle might gross you out but it makes for a delicious beer
1548,Spotted Cow,4.21,claims to be a farmhouse ale taste like a cream ale nice summer beer could drink all day long and not feel bloated picked up a case at total wine after stopping at brewery this one you will remember best selling beer in wi and only available there as well
1549,Spotted Cow,3.75,1 pint draft poured into shaker glass at dugout 54 in milwaukee very quickly dissipating head light mild taste highly sessionable beer not much hoppiness or maltiness
1550,Spotted Cow,4.55,tried this for the first time as a draft beer smell great and had a nice light finish
1551,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.9,rereviewing this one as its been a dozen years since i last reviewed it  12oz can 5162023 into a tulip pours a clear amber color with a huge billowing almost duvellike eggshell head with lots of sticky lace  aroma is hoppy and grassy floral piney northwest hops fragrant sweet malt  taste is a blend of bready caramel malt and floral hops light bitterness clean water nicely balanced very old school  mouthfeel is soft medium bodied crisp drinkable something about it is vaguely reminiscent of beers brewed with belgian yeast  overall a tasty classic approach to the apa one of my first goto beers from the 90s its somehow comforting to know that beers like this are still being made ____________  previous review 8192011 preserved for posterity  3835  rdev 18 look 4  smell 35  taste 4  feel 35  overall 4 on tap in an american pint glass at bicks broadview grill review from memory less than 30 minutes ago  color is a slightly hazy copper with a beautiful 1finger head good carbonation  aroma is floral and herbal hops  taste is floral bitter hops with a nice pale malt balance this beer straddles the line between a pale ale and an ipa used to drink this often and its been way too long  overall this is a good example of a northweststyle pale ale generous with the hops and always refreshing
1552,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.96,12oz can date stamp on can bottom is pkg on 042023 very legible stamp nearly clear deep gold colored body one finger of white head which settles back to a thin cap and ring leaves behind strings and spots of lacing aroma of toasted malt with hops expressing the flavors of citrus and grass taste has a solid malt base citrus flavors of orange and lemon slightly spicy grass floral medium mouth feel which is substantial some tongue sting very good carbonation a totally good experience all around
1553,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,5,smooth flavorful thick feel perfect pale ale clean tasting yum
1554,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,5,lets try this one out of a bottle definitely great flavor piney crisp and light i love his beer cheers
1555,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.71,a nice easy drinking pale ale but prefer sierra nevada pale ale
1556,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,4.19,on tap in the marvelous bryson city outdoors taproom a deep orange amber with nice creme head good aromas of hop and malt and very nice tasting brew with a clean hop balance very nice maybe better than sierra pale ale excellence
1557,Torpedo Extra IPA,4.14,pours clear and amber in color with nice head and good lacing getting pine and orange aromas which are fairly strong very nice tasting and a beer that you can enjoy drinking a lot of not as nice as the lengthwise zeus imperial ipa but definitely a very excellent quality beer getting malt and hop tastes i feel that if it had a little less bitterness it would taste way better it is very smooth in the mouth and feels thick  overall a very high quality beer and i definitely plan to buy more of it
1558,Torpedo Extra IPA,4.24,ipa is my go to style and hop presence is important but thats not to say the more the better and the most hops wins balance is extremely valuable so it matters that the grain flavor isnt covered by the bitterness so using more grain for a stronger ale requires more hops and this one does that in great proportions
1559,Torpedo Extra IPA,4.14,not as dank as i was expecting from the can but thats no bad thing pours dark clear amber mild carbonation instant scents of pine florals and citrus taste follows but with maltiness and subtlety its very mellow for its abv and dangerously drinkable lovely stuff
1560,Torpedo Extra IPA,3.82,poured from a 12 ounce can into a teku glass  look medium amber moderately hazy cream colored frothy head above average head retention average lacing  smell pine resin biscuit clementine floral medium strength of scent  taste biscuit pine resin clementine high strength of flavor  feel medium body high bitterness mildly astringent average carbonation moderately creamy  overall medium amber with moderate haze and cream colored frothy head bouquet predominantly malty with pine resin and some citrus notes flavors were overly malty with pine resin and mild citrus character body was medium with mild astringency and high bitterness overall this beer was much to malty for the abv in my opinion the flavor was strong it just wasnt one that match my palate preference
1561,Torpedo Extra IPA,5,this is and has been my go to beer for several years i have tried many many ipas some were good at first but did not taste as good later it has the perfect balance of hops and malt full bodied yet not overpowering still my favorite ipa
1562,Torpedo Extra IPA,5,one of my favorite everyday ipas it checks all the boxes and is just a really delicious ipa love the higher ibu
1563,Torpedo Extra IPA,2,while i find the original sierra nevada pale ale to be quite flavorful and refreshing the torpedo extra ipa was just too much for my tender lil guy taste buds not for me way too harsh not enjoyable  style ipa  tapcanbottle bottle  abv 72  rating 2
1564,Torpedo Extra IPA,4.49,fabyellow brownish in color pines in smell balanced by sweetness the taste is bitterness of hops balanced by sweetness of caramelized malt sharp finish light body so drinkable and enjoyable a great take on ipa
1565,Old Chub,4.75,poured up into my irish pint glass  appearance nice dark amber with a nice white foamy head that settles into a ring of foam around the glass with decent lacing  smell caramel with toffee with nice malt forward toasted notes some bittersweet chocolate as well  body full bodied and thick very satisfying on the mouthfeel  taste nice malt forward upfront with delicious dark fruits plums raisins did i say raisins sure did and its delicious followed by some banana in the background with coffee notes with bitter sweet chocolate despite the 8 abv no boozy aftertaste at all  overall this is absolutely delicious nice full bodied scotch ale loaded with flavor that the craft beer enthusiast will love not a beer to be swilled down due to the the 8 abv savor and enjoy cheers

1572,Pearl River Lager Beer,3.68,smells like unripe feijoas  nice lager smooth drop so dont drink it fast because it will put you on your ass  although nice semi warm its a dream if nicely chilled but do try it for yourself  if you like tsingtao you will convert  if you can tolerate kingfisher then i think youd like the taste of this beauty
1573,Pearl River Lager Beer,1.09,horrible
1574,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.66,poured from a green 112 oz bottle has a light golden color with a 12 inch head smell is of green apples grains not a good sign taste is green apples some grains a bit of vinegar kind of bland feels light in the mouth and overall is not terrible but not to my liking
1575,Pearl River Lager Beer,1.75,i had this beer while travelling in china on business in april 2015 likely to never get there again so i decided to try as many different china brewed beers as i could this was 1 of 6 beers i tried in my travels and in doing my research before departing the states this was considered a top 10 china euro lager beer the abv was 53 according to my language assistant i poured from a clear glass 600ml bottle after purchasing at a restaurant quite a different look from the picture depicted a  mellow yellow with very slight head and almost no carbination s  grainy mild to the nose t  watery and bland with some sweetness f  light no lacing and thin  if you must have a beer while in china then give it a go  but it is not much to write home about
1576,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.47,format a 330ml dark green bottle with a pretty ordinary macro label looks suspicious  appearance pours out a fairly thinlooking light yellow with okay carbonation a fizzing white head drops from a finger almost immediately doesnt look great  aroma there is a touch of cereal grain there but much more adjuncts  particularly rice smells cheap if not offensive  taste i dont mind some asian adjunct beers  some actually make the rice taste quite nice this is not one of those beers an awkward fug from the rice and only cheap and light cereals to back it up  aftertaste more rice awkwardness on the finish not a great beer  mouth feel light in body to the point of being somewhat watery with a moderate to higher carbonation  overall a fairly cheap lager at au38 a case but there are better quality beers even at this level id rather spend a few bucks more and get some vb
1577,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.26,drank it directly from an ice cold can thats how you drink macro lager 43 abv  typical adjunct with very minor skunky taste poor malt presence plenty of rice though  good to go with chinese food especially crayfish stirfried with szechuan peppercorn
1578,Pearl River Lager Beer,3,touch of grain some bit of skunk definitely more beery than the weaker pearl river beers with some extra bitterness thats not entirely metallic quaffable cheap
1579,Pearl River Lager Beer,1.67,330ml can from yue hwa chinatown singapore sgd 230 light golden straw that is clear and thin with a bubbly white head on top that sets as a patchy lacing that barely covers half of the surface area  sweet with water and light grassy hops making up most of the rest there are a few adjuncts but thats about it and it is very light  water with a hint of sweetness and the faintest of grassy hops on top there is a bit of biterness but not much else to speak of other than a hint of citrus towards the end  thin and light with medium carbonation and a strange semisweet feel with a hint of skunk and bitterness  a very poor beer and up there with some of the worst i have tried although by no means the very worst the beer was cheap and thin with little in the way of taste or smell
1580,Abner,4.59,such a well balanced beer hill farmstead doesnt go crazy with one flavor profile and that is embodied here while labeled a ne ipa is more caramel colored than hazy and tastes blend west coast and east coast styles similar to focal banger definitely hoppy at the start but mellows with a malty oaty finish partly hoppy and partly rustic abner is a expertly minimalist ipa they do all the little things right
1581,Abner,4.34,a really great double ipa had a pint at the bench restaurant in stowe vt pours a hazy orange color with a good size white head and good lacing on the glass mostly citrus aroma but nicely balanced with hoppy goodness mouthfeel is rich crisp and moderately bitter an outstanding double ipa
1582,Abner,4.61,definitely a double the alcohol flavor is produced more so than other hill farmstead beers however the beer is truly a hf beer with the deep caramel hue and succinct crisp hoppiness that is so refined amazing beer but i prefer a lower alcohol beer
1583,Abner,4.69,6 weeks old can to wine glass  look pours a goldenbrownish orange with a pillowy white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a good amount of lacing floaters all over the place  smell piney resiny somehow woody and slightly smoky also sweeter notes of melon and gummy bears  taste less intense more balanced but all the notes which can be smelled can also be tasted resiny body with notes of sweet melon and burnt caramel and something woody and smoky popping up here and there medium sweetness followed by an intensely bitter finish  feel clean and full at the same time medium carbonation quite crushable  overall very complex west coast style iipa that combines a typical piney and woody body with different kinds of sweetness some unexpected notes smoke gummy bears are also in the mix but everything fits in seamlessly id definitely locate this one somewhere close to heady topper and pliny the elder great beer that once again demonstrates the versatility of hill farmstead brewing high quality stuff from different styles
1584,Abner,4.48,draft at armsby abbey  well damn my first hill farmstead beer and its the 35th highest rated beer on ba i know theyre more known for their saisons but im very happy to try this  pours a hazy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing  for the style this isnt super juicy in the nose im picking up on aromas of the overripe melon lemon zest bready malt light caramel peppery hops fresh grass and grapefruit rind  its a little more aggressive in taste but still feels more rustic than juicy and fruity on the front end of the sip im tasting lemon zest crackery malt tangerine overripe melon weedy hops and light caramel the swallow brings notes of grapefruit zest orange juice bready malt peppery hops fresh grass and light tangerine  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a zesty yet creamy beer finishes mostly dry and very balanced  holy shit this is a great beer super unique for the style and so drinkable especially for the abv i need more
1585,¬ßucaba,4.32,2018 vintage sipped on march 24 2023 in a stout snifter glass  dark brown with deep red highlights a near 1f cap appears briefly before settling to a thick rim film a few spots of lacing surprisingly  oak aged bourbon and booze aroma up front toasted dark bread malts chocolate and caramel  flavors of bourbon soaked toast and malt vanilla dark chocolate and a touch of cherry wine  big and boozy body yet quite smooth theres a light touch of carbonation and the dark chocolate slips in the finish  an incredibly well aged barley wine ale a nice tug of war between strong booze and mellow sips
1586,¬ßucaba,4.53,vintage 2018 poured from bottle into tulip good 2 finger head recedes rather quickly to a small pool so so lacing jet black in the glass no light gets thru big barrel on the nose caramel toffee and dried fruits good nose taste follows the nose big bourbon on the front big hit of malt sweetness creamy caramel some raisin plum on the tail end and finishes with a good assertive bitterness residual bourbon caramel left on the palate
1587,¬ßucaba,4.27,12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter 2018 vintage drank january 23  caramel brown with a half inch of short lived tan foam some suspended sediment from the second pour malty sweet aroma caramel bread dark fruit and some mild alcohol tastes much the same with the addition of toffeemolasses type sweetness and a touch of metallic tang it is sweet but a clean bitter finish keeps the sweetness well in check medium body low carination smooth and soft closing with a warm alcohol bite  this has held up well but the ba character is gone and im guessing some of the hop flavor has disappeared but oxidative flavor really only a small metallic tang is low drinks easy considering the high abv
1588,¬ßucaba,4.38,2018 release consumed 82222  rightfully a classic of the style the 2018 bottle is very smooth and although i taste the alcohol its very easy to drink the bourbon is definitely there and wonderfully balanced as it should be the mouthfeel is thinner than a ba stout this is a wonderful world class beer and always worth having on your shelf or fridge
1589,¬ßucaba,4.54,had the 2018 version on tap at other half dc  dark mostly opaque reddish brown still somewhat see through tan head  raisin boozy maple toffee oak fig jam on the nose taste follows but with some coffee bitterness to go with the fig raisin clove toasted sugar chocolate  probably best barleywine ive ever had boozy but not over powering somehow everything seems in place where i often find barley wines to be unbalanced in one way or another
1590,¬ßucaba,4.5,12 ounce bottle 2019 vintage 01192019 is stamped on the neck of the bottle im assuming thats the bottled on date served in a snifter the beer pours a dark reddishbrown color with about an inch light tan head head retention and lacing are both good i like the aroma the brew smells like bourbon vanilla brown sugar coconut cherry and oak really sweet and malty smelling for the most part i think the taste is similar to the aroma but with the addition of some raisin fig and chocolate flavors its sweet tasting but not overpowering at all mouthfeelbody is full its coating and easy to drink with a lowmoderate amount of carbonation if youre into english style barleywines then definitely pick this one up im glad i did
1591,¬ßucaba,4.94,2018 sucaba enjoyed november 2021  rich warm intense cola brown in the glass light aroma with toasted coconut standing out thick almost excessively so with a long finish theres a hint of hops on the end sticky and sharp
1592,¬ßucaba,4.54,no head hazy caramel brown body smell is rich bourbon whisky dominates with caramel malt figs tobacco and a healthy rye spice taste is more subtle than expected figs brown sugar whisky cherry just a hint of coconut vanilla and lots of rye spice smooth drinking nice alcohol warmth not as overpowering as expected which is good it has balance and plenty of going on what an amazing sipper if i had a cellar id jump on another bottle
1593,Head Hunter,4.23,12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for 299 plus tax canned on 051523 so this beer is almost three months old  look it has a nice orange gold color with a half finger of beige colored head the beer is fairly clear however it is unfiltered and there is a slight haziness  chill haze  smell lots of resinous pine and citrus grapefruit and orange notes also dried pineapple this smells really nice i wouldnt mind wearing fragrance that smelled like this theres a subtle darker biscuit malt underneath all of the hops spicy notes along with some paint thinner subtle green bell pepper on the finish more fruitiness comes through on the nose as i get into it and as the beer warms up i ultimately get a nice sweet cantaloupe note along with lots of orange zest  taste ooooh this is seriously intense they werent kidding when they said aggressively hopped westcoast ipa it has a bit of that enamelstripping character that scares you at first and then ultimately endears you is actually really nice and while it is very bitter on the finish it still has very clean flavors on the palate and the bitterness doesnt linger too long it also has a nice caramel malt character to stand up to the piney resinous hops and bitterness so its actually fairly balanced for such an aggressively hopped beer quite impressive and enjoyable  feel it has a medium to medium plus mouthfeel with a bit of chewiness very clean  overall its really good i kind of liken this beer to a stronger version of sierra nevada celebration ale for such a bitter and resinous beer its actually quite drinkable and refreshing this is just my second fat heads brewery  saloon beer good stuff  from the website hops simcoe centennial mosaic citra chinook malt pale c15 carapils carahell wheat yeast american ale beginning gravity 168 plato ending gravity 30 plato color deep golden
1594,Head Hunter,4.31,enjoyed a pint with lunch after visiting the pro football hall of fame 8923 for 550  beer was served golden orange with a nice white head  nose was a nice combination of tropical and citrus fruits  taste was new school ipa with a not quite imperial sized malt base that displays nice flavorful hops that give notes of orange grapefruit mango and some strawberry finishing with a nice piney bitterness 610 on my scale  mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and refreshing  overall a delicious wcipa this is dangerously crushable
1595,Head Hunter,4.24,i consulted the toprated beers list for ohio on this site before taking a road trip this beer was 21 on the list with thousands of reviews so i had to find some this is a superior ipa nice fresh scent when i first poured it and lots of foam that lasted a little hazy dark amber color this was hoppy but ive had more intense hop taste even so this was delicious i tasted grapefruit and maybe some orange or lemon nice mouth feel should have bought more next road trip
1596,Head Hunter,4.21,poured from a 12 oz can dated 62323 into a pint glass l  pours a medium amber color with a fluffy white head that dissipates slowly s  smells of pine and citrus t  tastes bitter citrusy and dank f  medium body and carbonation o  very nice west coast ipa
1597,Head Hunter,4.87,clear deep gold nice white head great retention rings of lace melon mango grapefruit lychee native grape aroma taste follows smell just enough malt to keep it balanced nice midrange sweetness lingering bitter finish medium bodied clean appropriately carbonated this beer is near perfect for a west coast ipa
1598,Head Hunter,4.35,solid west coast style ipa strong hops aroma with great bittering
1599,Head Hunter,4.64,very nice great hops nice dry finish
1600,Head Hunter,4.27,cloudy yellowgold color with nice white head super piney but also juicy flavors of mango orange grapefruit and pineapple overall really fantastic when fresh on tap
1601,Head Hunter,4.56,tasted from a 16 oz can acquired in ohio  l  light gold color with very slight haze and constant mesmerizing streams of tiny bubbles that constantly rise through the beer huge pillowy frothy offwhite head that lasts and lasts  s  big hops aromas of grapefruit and mandarin orange but with another earthy note similar to pineapple there is a bit of bready malt in the finish very restrained like a saltine cracker  t  strong citrusy hops hit the mouth immediately with navel orange grapefruit and pine the hop flavors are aggressive as hell and leave no room for malt to shine through exceptionally clean fermentation with no yeast fruitiness noted  f  medium body with a bit of mouthcoating effect yet somehow the finish feels dry moderate to high carbonation gives a fizzy impression on the tongue hops bitterness strong enough to peel paint alcohol presence fairly high which matches the listed abv but the strength seems appropriate with all the other heightened sensory inputs  o  this is a worldclass american ipa on the aggressive end of the styles spectrum it slams your senses unapologetically and i love it for that
1602,O'Doul's Amber,3.43,clear light amber with 12 finger of quicklydissipating light than head  smell is slight caramel and toffee as would be expected good aroma just not much of it  taste is molasses toffee bread crust tea and a bit of noble hop spiciness almost like having the base bread for gingerbread with a glass of iced tea but much less flavor intensity and drier moderate bitterness  feel is light  with moderate fine sharp carbonation  overall decent beer in an absolute sense and good for na beer none of the unfinished wort flavor that is present in oldschool na beer the tea flavor is the only oddity but halfway through it im used to it if i wasnt doing a review im not sure i would have specifically noticed it
1603,O'Doul's Amber,2.39,purchased in canada brewed in canada under labatt this is probably my favourite non alcohol brew so far nice mild malt and the subtle hop expression really seems to shine in this one not crazy about the ingredients having glucose syrup but theres only 2g of sugar per can so it cant be much
1604,O'Doul's Amber,4.81,if youre comparing this brew to real beer dont this is a nonalcohol brew if you are a retired alky like me this is a godsend it is as close to real beer as i have ever tasted i now have something to look forward to when eating pizza or burgers now when we go to friends for dinner i bring a 6 pack of amber and i capital i can drive home thanks ab
1605,O'Doul's Amber,4.67,great alternative and nice taste i enjoy it during the week when you dont need or want to drink
1606,O'Doul's Amber,1.67,i only drink this if i am a guest at someones home and they bought it for me because i do not drink alcohol otherwise i would not buy or drink this stuff
1607,O'Doul's Amber,1.77,tuesday october 12 2021 818 pm 12 ounce bottle poured to wine glass sight amber clear off white foam lacing smell malty aroma not a lot of hoppy aroma taste slightly bitter not a lot of taste mouthfeel creamy slightly tart  medium body lively carbonation long finish bitter aftertaste overall fair not ok too repeat not to look for
1608,O'Doul's Amber,2.23,12oz brown bottle  review from notes  this is slightly better than regular odouls but both suffer from having little flavor and what little flavor there is is mostly funky garbage juice but there is a bit more malt to this and id take it over the og anyday  shout out to kenny dennis
1609,O'Doul's Amber,1.23,purchased as a single bottle from kroger for 99 poured into a nonic pint glass  l  pale very clear amber with zero head s  wholegrain sliced bread bran flakes and deer feed not much else t  molasses and bran are pretty upfront and is quickly followed by a vile flavor along the lines of a musky old bread thats been left in the hot sun for two or three weeks fairly sweet with nothing to balance it out reminds me almost of ipecac syrup f  thick with minimal carbonation not easy to drink o  its pretty hard to fuck up worse than the original odouls but they managed to do it with this one for the price i would pay ten times the amount for you to not make me drink this i have a feeling it would be slightly less terrible if it was wellcarbonated i mean itd still be awful but itd be drinkable i think this is the second entry of the beers i actually hate list i highly recommend not purchasing this its not worth it even if its less than a dollar
1610,O'Doul's Amber,3.06,12 oz bottle code 20223 cg0156 twistoff crown purchased single off shelf poured into a 14 oz mug  l polishedclear tawnycolored liquid ambertinged foam on the pour which all but disappears leaving only a razorthin collar  s relatively mute aroma expression lightlyworty brown bread crust no offputting offaromas just dull  t vienna lagerlike but one thats old and perhaps slightly oxidized bold yet dry apple juice overtone the aftertaste is near bone dry with a mellow caramel note most prominent also a lowmoderate neutral bitterness and maybe a mild toasted bread around the edges really it tastes almost syrupconcentratelike  f might as well be flat the little tingle it lends gives a flicker of life to its coiled light body the little bit of pudge up front swells then vanishes  o probably not supposed to pour this in a glass  i guess i should have expected such bland blandness the code suggests this bottle is almost a year old maybe ill take another crack at this in the future  interesting run of na brands leading up to this milestone review 1750
1611,Molson Golden,4,poor i would beat you as easily as rick moranis molson golson mofos
1612,Molson Golden,1.94,i havent had this beer in over 25 years and now i know why starts with a sourfunky aroma taste follows the aroma but is somewhat mutedthankfully i know my tastes have changed but i couldnt find much to like about this beer
1613,Molson Golden,2.04,when i first started drinking beer it was busch miller and shlitz then i tried molson golden thats all my friends and i drank now fast forward 40 years its okay i dont hate it i just out grew it
1614,Molson Golden,2.04,ehhh it says on the bottle specially brewed for the unique flavor of an ale and a lager problem is its a weak ale and weaker lager this could be okay if it wasnt so watered down
1615,Molson Golden,3,molson golden lager 5  clear straw gold color with a frothy white cap of foam solid lager aroma and taste with mild corn grains and hops better than most cheers
1616,Molson Golden,3.23,molson coors canada molson golden 12 fl oz green glass bottle coded sep2622 13 61020040408 sampled on may1222 129912pk  total wine  more cherry hill nj  notes via stream of consciousness its poured a gold to deep golden body beneath a fingers width of white foam the aroma is sweetish and just lightly grainy its obvious that this is an adjunct beer the hops are as expected light nonspecific and in the background the flavor follows pretty closely its lightly sweet and threaded through with delicately spicy and herbal hop notes theres also a delicate applelike fruitiness to it as far as bitterness goes theres just enough to balance it and it teeters on becoming sweet it finishes with a drop of sweet malt and apple lingering and then some emerging hops as the malt erodes the head dropped fairly quickly althought plenty of fine bubbles can be seen rising steadily below id say thats about average and the lacing follows suit in the mouth its mediumlight in body and gently crisp all in all its not bad for what it is review 7961
1617,Molson Golden,3.28,molson golden is perfect beer before oktoberfest from when it gets hot in n hemisphere around memorial day to labor day this beer quenches your thirst leaves a nice crisp up front flavor then a corn and hop finish drink this ice cold in july and august but when september rolls around it is change to another beer at middle of september i stock up on oktoberfests since they are best and seasonal granted you can get molson golden all year round and i did get a case of this in winter but this is a summer beer i wish golden was a 55 or 57 at only 5abv it is on par with labatt blue granted different flavors this is a typical adjunct lager that is designed to be consumed with speed this beer reminds me of fishing on 1000 islands in a boat which is illegal in canada good times i say 325 overall but certainly not poor this is a good beer and deserves respect for being a good macro i know the men with man buns would argue that ipas are better blah blah blah but for an import and being a beginner beer for the 16 to 20 crowd down the tracks or in the woods this is a tasty beer i guess the use of corn makes it cheap too but for a adjunct lager this is what is expected
1618,Molson Golden,3.6,drank ridiculous quantities of this in college in rochester molson dominated there we used to fill the bed of a pickup truck for bottle returns weekly while fond memories and nostalgia drive a likely higherthandeserved rating i do believe this still tastes okay and quenches the thirst on a hot summer day
1619,Molson Golden,2.46,i cannot believe ive never reviewed this old time classic this beer was once regarded as the high end of imports my dad and older friends really thought there was something extra special about canadian importsmaybe there was circa 1993 i dont know but it really did seem exotic to be when i was 16  soo here we go it couldnt be more clear gold watery pale gold thin scattered white foam lace  sweet corn and green hop with sour yesstie aroma all over  subtle cleaneasy feel like water but with fermented canned corn and wheat crisp bite then smooth with a green corn wheat and long malty flavor subtle easy mundane  its a 700 6 pack bro
1620,Molson Golden,3.3,molson beer in canada is better and different than what gets sent to the usa its a bit more hoppy crisp and very fresh tasting with a some more bite than the us version even in the 1980s i had long neck bottles in montreal and i enjoyed the light taste of molson
1621,Molson Golden,3.27,poured into a grip shaped goblet color is straw transparent head is off white and presents with less than 1 fingers worth of head then dissipates to nothing but a ring along the glass  smell is sweet corn adjunct and a nice grassy hop kick  taste is adjunct basic macro lager some corn limited hop character  mouthfeel is high carbonation moderate sweetness low bitterness but sharp carbonic lingering bite  overall a decent macro lager the sweet corngrassy hop kick is enticing and the adjuncts are not awful
1622,Molson Golden,2.26,poured a clear pale yellow with a half  finger white fizzy head that disappeared in seconds there is very little visible carbonation this bottle is without a nose taste of slight corn sweetness with a tiny hop finish moderately full body with light carbonation very disappointed in this beer which i have not had in over 30 years and i use to like i remember mg had a lot more flavor head and aroma this is not worth the calories
1623,Molson Golden,3,12oz green twistoff bottle stamped sep2721 poured into a vintage bowtie glass at fridge temp no abv listed on label the beer pours bright light straw yellow with nearly white head the head recedes to a pencil thin ring and single layer of tiny bubbles the aroma is faint with slightly sweet grain and corn the taste is semisweet  barely tart with minimal bitterness and noticeable diacetyl the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a somewhat dry finish overall poor not clean with no noticeable malt character label says this is made in golden co assuming by coors
1624,Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.48,thinner barleywine both in appearance and in mouthfeel hops are noticeable on the nose lots of barrel in the profile with a lovely bourbon barrel aged maple syrup character great under the radar barrel aged barleywine
1625,Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.5,2019 version poured from a 12 oz bottle into a morning delight tulip glass toffee aroma taste is sweet malts molasses barrel smooth sweet and boozy
1626,Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.26,bottle from bottle barn mahogany pour fluffy head fades to tiny ring woody toffee aroma hint of booziness to come taste is sweet malts molasses barrel notes smooth sweet and boozy wonderful
1627,Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.5,dark cloudy brown with lightly fuzzy hpead and lacing smell is boozy malty dark fruit notes molasses and brown sugar taste is boozy bourbon sweet brown sugar and molasses light dark fruit and vanilla notes medium bodied mouth watering and yes boozy very good
1628,Apricot Ale,4.3,pours a cloudy honey gold with a finger of head that dissipates to a thin ring with a little lacing aroma of apricot and tart apricot taste follows nose wonderful
1629,Apricot Ale,4.21,rated in 2016 and gave it an overall of 358  thought id give it another go 2009 bottling  uncorked bottle and lost half of contents to it be a gusher ugh  cloudy pale rose color medium nose fruity flanders red style taste was a lot more balanced nice stone fruit presence thirst quenching drinkable and much more palatable  okay came back to bump up my score its growing on me
1630,Apricot Ale,4.02,13 oz snifter draft pour at lures bar  grille pours a hazy creamy yellow with an offwhite head aroma and flavor feature sour apricots oak tannins leather funk clean malt and tons of acidity very sour mouthfeel is prickly and astringent overall its tasty but a bit unbalanced
1631,Apricot Ale,3.73,375ml corked and caged bottled 2017 opened 62020 small pop and hiss upon opening small white head that disappears quickly no lacing bright golden apricot flesh color and fully opaque vinous aroma oak barrel and muted apricot fruit initially bracing acid tart and bright fruit and just a hint of powdery funk the apricot becomes more pronounced as the beer warms overall the warmer it gets the less sharp and more flavorfulenjoyable it gets medium body low plus carbonation lengthy high acid finish very good
1632,Apricot Ale,3.58,cascade is one of the few us sour brewers that i regularly enjoy i have no idea why 750ml cc bottle2015 project split with my wife  id be remiss if i didnt mention i picked up this bottle at hyvee for 5 on clearance because why not the pour is unalloyed gold with plenty of life with a nose of what tart apricots thats just a guess  apricot ale is a sharp simple beast nitric acid puckers the palate  the barrels team up to cause arid mouth syndrome apricot is subtle but runs throughout light  airy this glass is going to do me just fine but its the rare sour i can consume more than one of  not cascades best work but perhaps the apricot is just not enough to stand up to the microbes still a good solid brew
1633,Apricot Ale,4.45,500 ml bottle served in a sour glass 2017  this beer pours a hazy yellow color it is topped with a fleeting tan head that leaves no lacing  the smell is pretty damn amazing i get funk dank basement and an acidic flanders ale smell there is tart apricot this is what i want sours to smell like  tart and acidic the apricot helps cut the acidity but only so much it has that wonderful dank basement and funk flavor the sourness is puckering and i love it  light bodied with a dry mouthfeel  i picked this up at a local store off the 12 off shelf i am pissed that i didnt buy them all i hope someone doesnt beat me to it great stuff
1634,Apricot Ale,3.86,a 750ml corked and caged bottle 2015 project poured into a 3 fonteinen stemmed glass  appearance a lightly hazy golden orange colour with a one finger white head that had decent retention while leaving lots of nice lacing  aroma tart apricot oak hay lime zest light funk  taste sour very sour tart apricot hay dust wood oak lemon zest  mouthfeel moderately sharp medium bodied with moderate carbonation  overall the flavours were enjoyable but it was just too sour and coupled with the acidity it was just a bit too much for any easy drinking but good for sipping
1635,Apricot Ale,4.14,this is one i prob should have had fresh but alas it became a cellar beer 2008 vintage so hopefully it held up  pours with no carbonation and no head the cork looked dried out so prob lost its carb over time very clear icedtea orangebrown copper color with tiny floaties  nose is quite nice not much for fruit but plenty of sour funk big bacteria souring and acidity acetic and lactic acids little barnyard funk getting a touch vinegary with some buttery oak still there and a bit of candied stone fruit in the background some malty aromas as well  taste brings more of the malt and sourness a bit of a sweet candy malt and caramelized sugars with some candied apricot not a ton a bit of alcohol but not much souring bacteria again with mild acetic acid maybe lactic but hard to tell light barnyard funk a little malt vinegar into some buttery oak as well mild tart flemmy finish lingering sourness malt and candied fruit  mouth is med bod a little fuller touch syrupy med acidity and funk low to almost no carb light alcohol warmth  overall not bad definitely an enjoyable sour but apricot is mostly gone as expected if im ever out there again ill def have to try this fresh provided there arent 20 other beers i need to try like last time i went
1636,Apricot Ale,4.42,2015 bottle  a  pours clear orange to the dregs a pretty sight with a moderate white head some thin lacing  s  acidity with punchy apricot lushness a hint of funk  t  bright sourness a mild fruit hit a subtle minerality and just a hint of sweet apricot that lingers in the close  m  mild carbonation and prickly acidity closing with a slick long tail  o  a superb sour delivering a solid bright core and lush fruit
1637,Molson Canadian 67,1,are you kidding me absolutely the worst beer ive ever tried a neighbor  friend bought a 4 pack of 16oz cans and invited me over to try one slightly amber colored on the pour no head no taste no nuttin glad i didnt buy it wouldnt even make a decent drain cleaner
1638,Molson Canadian 67,2.59,ok we get it its not heady topper its not an illustrious ipa not is it even regular molson canadian we get it that being said our neighbors to the north crafted a very good lowcalorie option for when you want to crank brews and not worry about your waistline molson 67 still holds that classic canadian lager tast with a third of the calories while that is something we at the 1009 are hardly worried about when grading this category its hard to avoid unfortunately this is a dying breed molson phased out 67 almost a year ago for molson ultra so we grabbed this while we could so long 67 you had a good run
1639,Molson Canadian 67,1.1,it tastes like if you left bread in a perrier overnight
1640,Molson Canadian 67,1,terrible
1641,Molson Canadian 67,2.23,355 ml bottle served cold into a pint glass leftovers from a party a couple of weeks ago  apperance clear rather play golden colour small half finger of white head with better retention than expected even a trace amount of lace  smell  weak grainy aroma with some corn notes metallic and slightly vegetative undertones nothing offensive  taste  a faint flavour of beer but mostly like beer flavoured tonic water or club soda nothing horribly offensive  mouthfeel  feels way over carbonated body is super light but these two factors dont go too well together  overall  worse beers exist and as a low carb option for people who dont like beer this may be viable still of youre drinking a beer this light isnt water a better option
1642,Molson Canadian 67,1.83,appearance  poured from a 473 ml can into a pint glass poured a very light clear straw color with 3 fingers foamy head that died fast carbonation looks lively enough does it look like the style yes  aroma  corn and water mostly water  taste  spring water with corn in the background  feel  extremely light watery body with prickly carbonation  overall  might as well just drink a molson caanadian original from what a remember the taste was tenfold better
1643,Molson Canadian 67,1.75,
1644,Molson Canadian 67,1.78,molson canadian sixty seven the look of it is very light and its yellow smell of hop and of corn remind me of the coors light it the molson canadian the smell of it nothing too different from the canadian very similar now the taste of it well nothing to different than a molson canadian a bit lighter a bit if a different taste to it its a bit plastic taste to it so overall would i recommend it  for man no for women maybe if you know what beer taste like dont drink that crap but for women who likes to drink beer but wanna drink low alcohol percentage and wanna have low calories this beer is made for u
1645,Landshark Lager,2,this is a below average lager pours a shampoo gold with a bubbly white froth the nose is non existent as is the case with these garbage brews no flavor at all
1646,Landshark Lager,2.8,bought a 6pack of bottles the first 3 were great and then they were rough after that  even for michelada mixing   wanted to like these more  but probably wouldnt buy again
1647,Landshark Lager,2.63,12oz undated bottle unless theres a date on the 6er i might get back to you on that  on the pour there was some decent white head that maxed out at 2 fingers although it faded fast surprisingly above average lacing is left on the sides of my glass body is golden and light  aroma is like an exaggerated corona with skunky hops right upfront and a dry but lightly corny malt in the back  taste is like a watered down and extra sweet killer high life with some of those corona style skunky hops this beer is very sweet and rhe finish tastes like corn flakes for the high price it just isnt good  feel is filling and syrupy why does this come off as so sugary the aroma did not imply it was going to be this full and lingering in the finish this is closer to heineken than corona and i mean that in a negative way  overall this was pretty disappointing not as bad as some true cheapo lagers but the whole selling point of this beer is jimmy buffet and honestly the brew is just as whitewashed and deluded as calling jimmy buffet authentic yucutan music
1648,Landshark Lager,3,average lager little lacing and a quickly diminishing head best quality is the clean dry finish which is also to say that is its only quality average beer
1649,Landshark Lager,4.95,i have never liked beer but i like to give it a chance a couple times a year i found this one and gave it a try i really liked this one so this will be what i will be drinking from now on
1650,Landshark Lager,2.86,12 ounce bottle no lime fizzy and yellow saved by a little bit of maltiness one and done
1651,Landshark Lager,1.26,you immediately get that strong sicking smell when you open it and it only gets worse from there it pours yellow and has some sort of nasty lime flavor tbf id prefer a bud light lime to this not a good summer beer at all
1652,Landshark Lager,3.65,16oz can code 22209 209th day of 2022 appearance clear medium strawgold think but lasting creamy white head moderate lacing  aroma very clean and mild cracker and creamed corn no discernable hops  flavor crackers and cornbread very scant hop low bitterness clean finish  mouthfeel light mouthfeel not watery nominal co2 no astringency or other harsh feels goes down easy refreshing  overall in 2022 landshark delivers on price and flavor clean and inoffensive a solid clean adjunct lager with no unpleasant surprises much like narragansett
1653,Landshark Lager,2.25,typical macrolager nothing to write home about refreshing and light  a good daytime beer
1654,Landshark Lager,2.74,smells slightly malty pours clear light gold taste of light malt and with a hint of lemon this has a crisp clean flavor but doesnt really inspire me to purchase another
1655,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,4.39,750ml waxed and capped bottle into a bbt snifter  pours as thick as motor oil dense dark no head or lace but with thick sticky mocha colored legs that stick around nose is incredibly aromatic chocolate dense mocha dank espresso all dusted with cocoa powder beer opens chocolate molasses espresso and mocha notes of syrup tobacco and barrel in the middle enhance a deep coffee bean presence more mocha espresso and a funky coffee bean bitterness in the aftertaste body is thick and chewy with low carbonation rich and full on the palate and goes down messy long lingering aftertaste few imperial stouts rival perenniala consistent body
1656,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,4.38,2022 version this was really good  dark black pour  great viscosity i think the coffee overpowered the barrel a bit  i wanted more barrel to say the least very enjoyable but ive had better coffee stouts
1657,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,4.43,look  black thick syrup nice rim smell  coffee chocolate barrel taste  same as smell just fantastic feel  thick and creamy medium light carb overall  pretty fantastic
1658,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,4.5,been sitting on this for awhile and finally cracked it at a share with a few friends it was well worth the wait definitely have to have it a little warmer
1659,Barrel Aged Bomb!,4.62,2021 vint 12 oz bottle into an oversized cognac snifter pitch black low foam leaves a lil ring of oily film instead smells of dark chocolate vanilla caramel and bourbon taste follows  cleans up with a zap of alcohol feel is heavy  a stout stout low to no carbonation overall  if you an adjunct stout fan youll do cartwheels over this meaty beaty big and bouncy
1660,Barrel Aged Bomb!,4.5,104 solid but prefer the og
1661,Hennepin,4.68,this is another one of those beers that have been around and drinking here and there so long that im surprised i havent reviewed it pours a cloudy gold with a huge white head cant fit the 12oz bottle in a pint glass excellent retention bands of lace aromas of green banana ginger white pepper savory herbs a bit of citrusy coriander sweet bready malt flavor with an awesome herb and spice component i get celery flatleaf parsley coriander ginger white pepper and a bit of clove along with some green banana and pear light bodied effervescent fluffy and satisfying mouthfeel really set the standard for american brewed clean saisons
1662,Hennepin,4.35,pours a clear golden color with a runaway tall foamy head and heavy lacing  smells of yeast banana citrus and spice  tastes of sweet malt belgian yeast orange pear and apple with an alcohol warm peppery finish  medium light body with moderate carbonation slightly syrupy smooth mouthfeel  this is a very tasty wellmade brew
1663,Hennepin,4.25,look huge head that receded quickly smell yeast lemon orange little bit of banana marshmallow maybe touch of pear taste follows nose with the fruit flavors especially lemon peel celery taste maybe what others are calling coriander considerable bitterness a hint of sweetness i did get the ginger but it took me a while a little funky wintery spices quite a luscious beer finishes dry but with a sweet tingle pleasant carbonation low viscosity but still creamy with the foam and crisp on the whole i like the spices and flavors of this beer a good modern saison i got this one from whole foods
1664,Hennepin,4.12,procured in a tradeproxy arrangement with turkeysdrinkbeer in february 2022 drink in october that year  l there are orange cordial vibes going on with the presentation of this beer making my mouth water before i even contemplate putting my nose into the glass theres no head bar a small rim around the edges sediment from the fullbottle pour hangs suspended in the beer barely ruffled by the few large bubbles of carbonation that dart to the top of the glass  s on the nose theres a slight yeast note and an indefinable tanginess that hangs in the aroma  t the taste has sweet orange sherbety orange pith and yeast  that orange note probably accounting for the tanginess i picked up on the nose the orange is followed by a musty slightly aniseed note its probably the coriander and whatever birdofparadise grain is or perhaps its the last vestiges of the yeast playing with those spices regardless its extremely tasty and definitely compels a second mouthful straight after the first  m on the tongue theres almost a sherbety quality to the beer but its followed by a spritzy snap after the swallow and it dries things out quickly after that point 425  o this beer comes together extremely well the taste is somewhat unique and the mouthfeel and nose only add to that impression i wonder if i could drink more than one of these though as i can imagine palate fatigue setting in quickly with such a sweet sherbety beer it treads this side of the cloyingly sweet line well but volume could push it over based on drinking one rather than several however it stands up very well  cheers
1665,Hennepin,3.98,great taste of a european farm house ale slightly sour
1666,Hennepin,4.02,awesome saison that most people could pick up and enjoy love the color on this and the foam sticks around forever bright orangey taste with a bit of ginger some delightful malty sweetness smell is a bit offputting very sour and yeasty a bit funky but its a very pleasing drink would definitely get it again ommegang is consistently excellent
1667,Hennepin,4.13,this was actually pretty close to excellent for me great floral notes grassy underpinnings and a good citrus finish i liked this one more than i thought i would
1668,Hennepin,4,expected a little more from this brew for the price and the rating enjoyed the carbonation akin to with a semisweet sparkling wine mouthfeel but overall it tasted too much like booze and spices i got mine from a 4pack at a grocery so maybe a draft experience would be different might seek out again
1669,Hennepin,4.21,nice golden color with a real lively foam head great spicy notes to the nose like clove nutmeg nice spice on the palate slight funk and bitterness and the carbonation is good cant go wrong drinking ommegang
1670,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,5,never drink this straight from the can pour chilled limearita into an icefilled glass and enjoy makes a quick  easy not too sweet margueritalike drink with a crisp carbonated finish getting difficult to find similar drinks have recently disappointed corona hard seltzer limonada and high noon sun sips hard seltzer lime were the most recent disappointments if you know of a good limearita substitute please let me know
1671,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2.42,5723 can from anthonys fridge  look is a sickly light straw color little to no bubbly no head  smell is sweet lemonade  taste is sticky sweet more lemonade than anything  feels and tastes like a melted freeze pop  how deceiving for it to be labeled bud light this small 8 oz can had 220 calories and 29 grams of carbs sugar bomb
1672,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2,gut rotter
1673,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2.34,pours the color of lemonline gatorade cloudy briefest of quarterinch heads that disappears a bit of carbonation breaking the surface no lacing smells like margarita mix with a whiff of alcohol burn at the back taste is thick sugary drink mix and cheap grain alcohol like something youd mix together with your friends in high school mouthfeel is thick sweet but the carbonation is nice
1674,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,1.79,if you want to puke i your mouth id suggest you to drink this its bad
1675,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2.11,smells like a margarita but doesnt quite have the taste of one as the lime is somewhat front and center but battling with other tastes for top spot feels slick on the tongue the booze is mostly hidden here but youll get to taste it soon enough i wouldnt have this again
1676,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,3.49,color on the pour seems to be a hazy yellow with no head at all smell is malty lime does that make sense like lots of lime with some really sweet white bread smells not bad but a bit odd taste is kind of a medicinal malty lime again a bit odd right mouth feel is sticky tangy sour and sweet a lot going on here right lots of bubbles still popping in the back of the mouth and throat after the taste kind of fun like pop rocks overall this is an over priced product i love that this is a bud light product i do not like a lot of the bud line up starting with the signature bud let alone the crap bud light yet this seems to laugh in the face of the bud light artificial flavor huge abv and nowhere light in the mouth feel i really have to rate this well for kind of kicking a lot of bud norms to the curb and i do apologize to regular bud drinkers carry on and cheers drink what makes you happy do not let some one else tell you what to drink
1677,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,3.18,25 oz can 19089 contains alcohol purchased cold poured into a 28 oz mug  l cloudy jadeyellow liquid foam on pour quickly collapses to nothing persistent activity of bubbles rising  s smells shooting out as soon as the tab was popped smells exactly like a blend of margarita mix and malt beverage  enticing but hardly representative of my beloved malt liquor species  t margarita mix sweet but not sickly so the backgroundbase is certainly malty no doubt and no doubt artificially enhanced with the added sugars but its definition is obscured rather flavorful faint vinyl pool liner note in the back though is that bitterness or booze struggling to break out a bit cloying eh  f its not allout syrupy but theres definitely a concentrate or two slicksliding though its core for 8 the booze is buried rather well not laborious to swill fantastically mellow in its alcohol presence but nonetheless a tad too weighty  o id been avoiding it but it was inevitable a gapfilling review if there ever was one alcopop all the way interesting but not all that bad for what it is ill never rid of my sweet tooth or my love of both malt beverage and lime i may have said it before but if slop like this is a malt liquor and the reasons this is on ba are probably understandable if debatable then yall gotta add my oldschool jawn smirnoff ice in somewhere  fruit and field beer wink wink 1467
1678,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,4.06,very intense aroma of banana vanilla and clove thats practically intoxicating on its own body is thick with a dank cloying sweetness thats filled with juicy banana melon cloves and honey earthy and pithy very interesting a great example of a belgian wheat
1679,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,4.36,i cant believe i havent reviewed this yet  pours out a clear straw color that becomes moderately hazy when the yeast is added remains translucent capped with a rocky head of snow white foam excellent retention barely reduces at all  nice tart citrus aroma lemon grapefruit not overly sweet or sour or candied or perfumelikequite restrained very wheaty some green banana hay and a touch of spices  nice pop of lemon and orange upfront green banana coriander doughy malt hay vanilla on the finish clean and crisp  fluffy and pillowy  dry extremely drinkable  world class witbier i cant believe this is only rated an 85 this set the benchmark for the style its flawless its a perfect witbier
1680,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,2.27,my girlfriends roommate gave me a bottle of this after she told me she didnt like it always interesting to have a beer given for free because it was so bad this should be a treat  look standard witbier look  smell strangely enough this smells exactly like sweet corn  taste unfortunately it tastes like it smells and it tastes like canned sweet corn juice not a pleasant taste  feel feel isnt horrible for what it is  overall it is hard to get past the smell and taste of straight sweet corn im not sure how this is 85100
1681,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,4.13,for a large productive brewery this is genuinely one of the better beers love the white gold hazy colour extremely drinkable and refreshing on palate fresh orange and good carbonation cannot fault and a few of these babies go down great on a summer evening
1682,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.85,if it is summer time hit this again and again easy on the pallette great to bring or drink at occasions looks nice in a small glass remember your getting 112 ounces so they go quick as another had saidlife is too short to drink beer water this will be a treat for all at the next bbq goes well with anything really but seafood even better with the hint of orange peel this one will have you hitting the head often so make sure to have a glass of water now and again you will thank me in the morning it makes for great conversation the monks dont fonk around  you need not be a beer snob but there is no reason to drink bud coors miller when you can go to the road less traveled without breaking the piggy bank
1683,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.42,750ml bottle in mae kasa thailand pours a hazy midgold with a white head aroma of orange and herb flavour of coriander orange wheat nicely balanced  a classic wheat beer
1684,IPA,3.78,pours a toasted golden color with a big rocky offwhite head some soapy lacing on the glass  a mix of floral and piney hops in the aroma a little bit of bud and perhaps mint bright  a light toasted malt a bit heavier than most ipas the hops are earthy with light pine notes  the malt is a beefy on the palate fairly balanced but finishes with a earthy bitterness  misses the mark on style more of a hoppy apa the malt is quite substantial its good though
1685,IPA,4.57,appearance slightly hazy amber big fluffy white head with good retention fast rising bubbles  aroma citrus pine and grassy  flavor citrus pine and grassy medium to low sweetness moderate bitterness  mouthfeel low astringency soft on the palate by finishes dry moderate length finish  overall an iconic ipa out of ga initial aromas are of citrus grapefruitlike and pine however as it warms and aerates you begin to pick up additional aromas of which fresh cut grass was most noticeable the tastes are just as complex you get a nice malty sweetness intermixed with citrus pine and herbs none of which are powerful or offensive it finishes semidry with a short eloquent bitterness perfectly balanced and harmonized nothing boring or harsh in this ipa start to finish one of my favorites
1686,IPA,3.96,dank drying and tasty
1687,IPA,4.25,yum a refreshing and delightful ipa just the right amount of hops and a surprisingly light mouth feel tastes and smells like a well thought out ipa the folks at sweetwater have a winner
1688,Antarctica Pilsen,1.63,269 ml can drinking in a glass thin persistent foam leaving laces terrible metallic notes and of cooked vegetables watery no smoothness only its powerful advertising strategies may explain why it sells so much
1689,Antarctica Pilsen,2.25,a 355 ml glass bottle served at 6 c poured into a pokal glass clear light yellow color with a poor head faint aroma with a hint of grain taste is similar to aroma nothing exciting watery with a medium carbonation rather short and faint finish
1690,Antarctica Pilsen,1.19,look clear and undertone gold color without sediments very low foam formation with very low persistence smell smelless none at all taste fleeting malt taste without expression none aftertaste feel very low carbonation watery overall very light pilsen beer without expression in all directions drinkability 15

1692,Antarctica Pilsen,1.5,
1693,Antarctica Pilsen,2.75,350 ml can in belem  49    nice looking white head dies down to a partial coat rather quickly but still leaves good lacing  finegrained carbonation is visible carbonation in the clear light golden body  feel light lively body with crisp mediumhigh carbonation  semidry finish   taste  typical light lager with hints of cereal as well as light malts and a touch of hops mild but lingering aftertaste more clearly reveals the hops   smell faint cereal and light malts with a touch of spicyherbal hops  o about average for this style in this area certainly not worth seeking out but passable
1694,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,2,had that one time at a party back in the day i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included
1695,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,2.66,make your own it will taste far superior this isnt horrible but not great either
1696,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.19,16 ounce can thanks to my friend laura for this one served in a pint glass the beer pours a light reddish color with about an inch or so light pink head that didnt stick around for too long small amount of lacing aroma is nice but also subtle the brew smells like tomato salt lime and a bit of clamato taste is similar to the aroma but i do think the clamato and tomato have more of a kick here theres also a bit of celery and grainy flavors noticeable too mouthfeelbody is light its easy enough to drink overall id have to say this is average its not bad but not great either ive had other bloody marychelada style drinks before and theres others i like a lot more than this but with that being said this one isnt offensive at all and id drink it again probably wouldnt buy it for myself though
1697,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.46,look this is not your homemade michelada no one should get this expecting the flavors of a high quality bloody mary or something like that most of these reviews seem to be from lager drinkers who like flavored beer but dont understand what this is supposed to be that being said if you want an incredible hangover cure that has more of an msg taste than a salt taste at least by comparison to a bloody or a homemade michelada but is well balanced with the acid from the lime and tomato this is your thing the salt content is there enough that you will taste it but very much more in a way that will make you grab this after a long bike ride rather than a day of sitting around that being said theyre heavy enough in fill but light enough in alcohol that a couple of these will last you a day of sipping in the sun with no worries about driving home later all in all as a michelada lover and someone who has developed my own recipe based on tommy sandovals this is the one i keep coming back to when i need to remind myself what its like this is the base of the flavors that define this cocktail and it is wonderful for what it is chuck your own couple dashes of hot sauce or cut it with more beer this mich is a utility and i can respect that about it is it 55 no fuckin way but i would challenge you to find a better canned michelada
1698,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,4.03,a lot of people are not judging this michelada fairly this is a great michelada that is a higher abv than most other micheladas on the market the clamato adds a great flavor profile that is very refreshing and delicious my only complaint is that it could use some more lime flavor i sometimes add a slice of lime to this and it makes it even better
1699,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,1.27,this one pours a weird and dead looking light red color with a small head and not much lacing  this smells like an old fetid tide pool salt warm rain water pepper spice and ketchup  i dont know who this is made for but its certainly not made for me the back end is weirdly sweet tomato ketchup type flavors but also with an unpleasant spice to it i dont mind a bit of brine in certain beers but it just feels so old and nasty with the clam juice in here  this is simultaneously super watery but also uncomfortably thick at times with a weird slickness it just kind of hurts going down  i could barely stomach about 3oz of this thing its just not my thing not at all i hate it
1700,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,4,25 oz can code 19236 purchased cold single poured into a gibraltar glass  l cloudy pinkish liquid looks like a raspberry wit but without any foam suds of which explode and vanish on the pour with subsequent pours the murk gets murkier and some nasty spitty tomatoy foam smears do cling tomato specks abound  s moderatelyintense emanation of tomato juice and limey brine on the nose however little if any clam smells innocent enough not necessarily offputting unless you have a depressingly dull diet certainly has a fresh floral overtone  t tomato juice mellow undercurrent of grainsoupy adjunct lager lightmoderate sea mist barely a kiss of citrus color but a rather forward peppery bite i wasnt expecting almost a subtle tomato pastey sweetness around the edges but thankfully not sweetlyflavored like caramel or sugar pepper and lightly malted tomato nectar prevalent in the aftertaste  f mildly spritzy carbonation coupled with the peppery bite makes for an enlivening burnsting upon the tonguepalate mellow heat building an embery fire take the flavors away and its arguably rather witsmooth in its textures up front and relatively pricklyhot at the back like perhaps an egregiously coriandered extratriple  o should i be surprised that i enjoyed and was fascinated by this  the recipe works well but to my taste id prefer a little more brine and maybe some umamifunk to give it more depth not sure id quite go gangbusters experimenting on cocktailish flavor doctorings with this but i can already think of a variety of ways to accent flavors here lime wedges more clam juice anchovy oleo celery salt spicy mango tequila chaser et al overtly bloody marylike noticeablydeliciously malty and applicable within countless culinary scenarios  needs and begs to be paired with charred meats oily carbs spicy fruits etc etc definitely going back for another  wow 1639
1701,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,1.92,blegh the taste of tomato is so strong it doesnt even taste like tomato its worse than a v8 it looks decent but tastes like clam juice do not drink
1702,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,4.74,the best chelada bud makes you get 25 ounces of tomato based clam beer beverage for 3 what more can you ask for im an ipa guy but the balance of spice clamato and budweiser creates a vortex of euphoria that smoothly slides down your throat look is typical of a cheladamichelada off redpink with floating bits of tomato smell is very tomato forward with the typical malt smell of budweiser taste is amazing a perfect balance of spice and refreshing light beer along with a decently high carbonation this is a great summertime beeri drink a lot of these after being on the water all day but also make great drinks after skiing too a great all around beverage
1703,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,4.32,any flavored beer in a big can you gotta be skeptical when my friend showed me this beer i couldnt believe what i had been missing i like budweiser but only on draft at a ballgame it seems this is a perfect combination ive mixed my own bud and tomato juice with a little worsteshire and lime its killer as well but you can get 2 of the 25 oz for 6 perfect great for hangovers i can only drink 2 of them at the most as they taste packed with sodium then i switch to regular beer cheers
1704,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,5,i cant get enough of these red beers  i have bought out every local storeal around me and it looks like i may have to make my own for a bit  i wish the distributors would push these a little harder in our area  its typical that you find something you really like and there is a very limited supply  awesome flavor and i wuld make a permanent place for it in my garage fridge if i could find more than a can or twould at a time 
1705,Landbier,3.82,clear straw fizzy small white head mediumpoor retention  smells sweet slightly funky a fruity note i cant quite place a hint of cocoa  pop of sweetness upfront corn cracker malt hay hint of lemon and pineapple peppercorn touch of grass corn sweetness with some ryelike spice and a musty mildew note crisp and clean and slightly dry finish  solid lager complex but crushable

1707,Landbier,4.08,pours clear golden with a frothy head the nose is bready malty with a touch of earthy spices and a touch of toast clean and crisp light bodied but with a firm bready and slightly toasty malt presence balanced effectively with earthy and grassy hops with notes of citrus they did a nice job making it interesting and flavorful within the style
1708,Landbier,4.51,a sturdy pour from a 16oz can yielded a finger of soapy white foam that slowly became rocky and then shrunk to a lasting cap leaving behind thin rings of lacing clear dull yellow straw color with extremely small rising bubbles  a perfect blend of bready dough fresh baked and toasted malts and floral hops greets the nose grain and grass with some apple juice and a hint of citrus featuring lemon join in  neutral at first with average bitterness as in the taste bready malt and floralcitrus hops prevail a little juicy but not as much as the smell suggests a faint kolschlike white wine taste appears the end of the taste is semidry but not crisp bitterness rises a bit with added spice the finish is a quick and even withdrawal of all flavors except for briefly lingering hops  very light bodied with plenty of lasting carbonation exceptionally smooth and easy to drink in spite of the light body and lowish abv a thin but sturdy malt backbone exists again i must mention the smooth and clean finish outstanding warms well and remains lively carbonated throughout

1717,Vanilla Porter,3.39,from a mixed 15 pak of 12 oz cans poured into a chilled pint glass pours a deep clear reddish brown color with a faint off white head that quickly dissipates and leaves behind no lacing aroma is faint vanilla like a vanilla coke taste is light and crisp with distinct sweet vanilla aftertaste mouthfeel is very light and not chewy as i prefer with a porter drinks more like a flavored brown ale or vanilla cocacola ok but not my style as far as porters go
1718,Vanilla Porter,3.5,still going through old reviews and posting them here  pours dark with a thin off white head  vanilla nutty and dark aroma  clear and present vanilla some dark nutty chocolatey undertones  light easy carbo and moderate to thin body
1719,Vanilla Porter,3.4,poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic pint  look  deep dark amber kind of a root beer color gorgeous shade head is fluffy billowing with life a bright cap on the mellow body a very attractive looking beer could be a hair darker though  smell  fairly weak initial note is just metallic but some toasted grains poke through after a bit no real vanilla or anything though  taste  vanilla and milk chocolate doesnt even register as a beer really more of some kind of dessert drink its not obnoxious or inyourface though its got a bit of class and sophistication  feel  a bit too thinbodied for how i typically enjoy my dark beers could do with a bit more sparkle and pep as well  overall  eh its ok for a random bottle somebody left in my fridge after a party i cant complain it makes for a decent weekday afterdinner sipper just a nice little tasty treat to finish the day
1720,Vanilla Porter,3.55,no head thin looking unremarkable brown color fairly thin mouthfeel overtly sweet vanilla smell and taste like an alcoholic version of a vanilla flavored soft drink
1721,Vanilla Porter,3.66,clear reddish brown appearance with an average size tan head and light lacing aroma of toasted nuts vanilla and ripe fruit vanilla overshadows the nutty slightly smokey character in the taste sweet malts are close to being cloying medium bodied moderately carbonated mouthfeel
1722,Vanilla Porter,3.6,l  copper pour with thin offtan head no lacing s  faint vanilla t  sweet tasting f  thin mouthfeel o  just not much here for me
1723,Vanilla Porter,3.64,poured from a bottle a thin light cola color the nose reminds me of a cream soda with the vanilla notes upfront its sweet to the sip with more of that syrupy cola character
1724,Chocolate Stout,3.62,draught nitro ibu 69 velvety tan head thick and bold black looking elixir soft dark and caramelized roasted grains for the aroma slightly watered down dark roasted grain and dark chocolate flavor that is ok
1725,Chocolate Stout,4.69,this beer is really good beautiful opaque look with a smaller dark khaki head first sip and you already taste the chocolate this isnt your normal dark chocolate stout this is a milk chocolate flavor and it is good probably higher on the calories so probably only have one but if you get the chance to try it do it
1726,Chocolate Stout,3.88,not really into chocolate but friend dropped off some stouts and this was one of them would not buy it but for what it is its well crafted dessert beer makes me miss lagers
1727,Chocolate Stout,4.25,pours a very dark color with nice head and lacing aroma has very generous dark chocolate hints the taste follows the nose with a well balanced very enriched chocolate flavor a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a good stout
1728,Chocolate Stout,3.53,on tap at das beer garden black body with a nice creamy khaki head smells of cocoa and roasted malt tastes of cocoa and roar malt as well milk chocolate without the milk roasted malt and light bitterness in its stead medium body and very drinkable low carbonation hitting some of the old classics and this does not disappoint
1729,Old Milwaukee,1,barf
1730,Old Milwaukee,2.09,old milwaukee beer  the look of it  a finger of head that quickly goes away yellow golden color light carbonation nothing special about it  the smell of it sweet grain and some corn  the taste of it taste like a newspaper  so overall would i recommend it  no  wanna have a cheap beer go get a pabst   would i buy it again  no
1731,Old Milwaukee,3.57,i rather like this stuff for a massproduced beer i find that it has a unique characteristic taste which hits the spot sometimes this is a notch above the rest of the pack its still just a plain old american adjunct lager but its a good example of the style imo
1732,Old Milwaukee,2.25,ok now im confused two old millwaters listed on here from two different breweries had to give them the same rating i believe the one we drank in college was brewed by either schlitz or strohs i am not sure and it really doesnt matter
1733,Old Milwaukee,3.23,new to this beer not that bad good head crisp with a bit o sweetness smooth
1734,Old Milwaukee,2.43,leftover from a party a couple of weekends ago served cold in a pint glass figured if i was going to drink it might as well review it gave it 25 across the board last time  appearance  pale piss yellow color with two fingers of fluffy white head that dissipate very quickly lots of bubbles and good clarity  smell  some general light grain aroma possibly some corn not anything else  taste  thin with initially a touch of grain and some corn sweetness and cooked veggies to close not great but worse certainly exists nothing too weird going on with after flavors  mouthfeel  thin fizzy and otherwise nondescript  overall  decidedly mediocre however worse aals are certainly out there and this is enjoyable enough if youre thirsty enough or its hot enough outside
1735,Coconut Vibes,4.43,while i wanted more coconut up front this was an amazingly complex beer everywhere else phenomenal mouthfeel incredible flavors
1736,Smoked Porter,4.49,poured from a 1 pt 6 oz bomber limited 2022 edition into a tulip glass  appearance very dark brown with a massive fluffy tan head that required multiple pourings to fill the glass as the head slowly receded and left abundant lacing  nose dark roast and wood smoke plus a bit of dark dried fruit sweetness  mouthfeel medium light adequate carbonation  attack chocolate dark roast and wood smoke nicely blended  finish bitterness from the dark roast to balance the roasted malt attack  overall an excellent brew well deserving of its high rating its also a home run pairing for the smoked then braised venison shoulder hank shaw recipe were enjoying with it for dinner ive purchased this brew before and will every year they brew it
1737,Smoked Porter,4.17,2022 bottle consumed in 2023 initial nose was overpowering but after letting it breathe a bit is was fine very dark in color with a tight tan head nose again after letting breathe for a few seconds was slightly charred taste was slightly smokey but more like a dark chocolate flavor smoked beers are not my thing but this was good
1738,Smoked Porter,4.25,22oz bottle vintage 2022 poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 65 abv the beer pours opaque medium brown in color with light brown head the head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing the aroma is moderate in strength featuring meaty campfire smoke the taste is strong smoke up front with lesser notes of dark chocolate and ashy roast in the background moderate bitterness the mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish overall straightforward and delicious
1739,Smoked Porter,3.96,2022 vintage  strangely enough this is one of the first beers i heard talked about on ba when i joined at the time the thought of a smoked beer seemed foreign to me and i spent a bit of time in my early days of beer trying to find this locally ultimately to never find it and forget about it so when i saw it in chicago i was suddenly brought back a few years and decided to instantly buy the bottle lets see what one of my first wants is all about  pours completely pitch black with a finger of tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  the smoke is huge in the nose but makes for a strange combination with the almost creamy underlying porter im picking up on aromas of charred oak campfire smoke milk chocolate vanilla dark toast brown sugar light earthy hops and burnt caramel  it takes the smokiness a bit too far in taste for my liking but ultimately its still enjoyable on the front end of the sip im tasting beechwood smoke charred oak milk chocolate raisin dark toast and molasses the swallow brings notes of campfire smoke charred oak acrid coffee burnt sugar molasses and light milk chocolate  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a slick yet smoky beer finishes mostly dry  well i finally had it is it good yeah amazing no its not quite balanced enough to say that but it was nice to finally try it its funny that this is my third review in a row that is a smoked porter and despite it being a long time want i eated it the lowest of the three
1740,Smoked Porter,3.99,2022 vintage  poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter  look black medium brown frothy head opaque no visible particulate average head retention slightly below average lacing  smell alder oats medium strength of scent  taste alder oats slight cocoa medium strength of flavor  feel medium body slightly below average carbonation moderately silky mildly creamy moderately bitter  overall black with a medium brown frothy head and average head retention bouquet was pleasant but dominated by alder smoke scent and simple the taste was also dominated by alder smoke and was just a touch harsh feel was medium bodied with mild creaminess and moderately bitter overall this was an enjoyable beer but i think it would have benefited from some age to mellow out some of the smoke character
1741,Smoked Porter,4,2021 version pours a deep brown with a medium head and almost no lacing  the smell is pretty strong chocolate and smokiness  the taste has strong smoke up front with a big char taste on the finish that lingers  the mouthfeel is mediumthin medium carbonation with a long smoky charred finish  overall a very enjoyable although strong tasting beer
1742,Smoked Porter,3.87,near jet black body that allows no light penetration tan one finger head light aromas of roasted malt and smoke dry bitterness on the tongue with roasted malt and delicate smoke i thought the mouthfeel was a bit on the light side with above average carbonation a well constructed porter
1743,Smoked Porter,3.75,2019 vintage a bit of bitterness from the hops or roasted malt that i think is excessive and conflicts with the smokiness
1744,Smoked Porter,4.36,from a large format bottle purchased and consumed on premises at the alaskan brewing public house in juneau this beer is probably underrated dont let the smoke deter you from trying this beer 45  a  pours with a two finger tan head with reddish highlights black opaque beer excellent lacing photo worthy 45  s  slightly smokiness in the nose 40  t  a nice dry english porter with good burnt bitterness smoke is evident but moderate faint faint malty sweetness dark chocolate but its about the bitterness theres some depth of taste as well as the beer warms the smoke swirls with the roasted malts to create a nice flavor 45  mf  some acrid bitterness on the back of the palate in the finish 425
1745,Tiger Beer,2.37,for reasons that are completely unclear to me this crappy lager is very popular in southeast asia so thought i should order a bottle at a restaurant in hoian last night  the beer pours the expected golden amber color with a white frothy head and light lacing head retention is fair at best on the nose i really dont get much of anything maybe some black pepper and some cereal grains along with some faint sandalwood mouthfeel is more of the same in this very light and watery beer the finish what there is of it is fairly dry with minimal bitterness alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile i know its only 5 but i would have guessed it was even lower than that so i guess this beer would be good for washing down salty or spicy food it really is pretty watery stuff  this beer was so lousy that i ended up getting a heineken after a bottle of this stuff it was the only other option at the restaurant the heinie sucked as well but it was slightly better than the tiger beer would not order this beer ever again
1746,Tiger Beer,2,500ml can purchased in canada full bodied and flavourful but not very good overall a lot of flavour for a lager but the flavour just isnt good not a lot of carbonation has a bit of a gasoline aroma and taste especially when it warms up a bit sort of reminiscent of a malt liquor
1747,Tiger Beer,3.03,pours a slightly cloudy pale golden coloratrion with a medium frothy quickly receding head and slightly visible carbonation smells of light crackery malt and grassy hops with hints of honey taste is a decent balance of light crackery grainy malt and grassy slightly floral hops with hints of honey and straw finishes with a light bitterness and some grassy hops and honey lingering in the aftertaste smooth mouthfeel with a light body and mediumstrong carbonation  im not saying that this is a great beer but for what it is it actually came as a pretty positive surprise to me maybe its because im having this rather fresh but its quite a crisp refreshing lager that goes down easy in the sweltering heat it may not be all that flavourful but what do you expect from a euro lager certainly better than any aal ive ever had while its not overly sweet with some decent grassy floral hops and a light bitterness noticeable in the finish pretty lightbodied for the abv though
1748,Tiger Beer,2.61,exactly what you would expect of a mass produced lager little flavor little aroma no head looks more like a pilsner the label says full bodied i cant find the body
1749,Tiger Beer,1.95,tastes like sugar and water no malt no hop
1750,Tiger Beer,2.88,clear yellow appearance fast fading head no lacing sweet malty vegetal aroma crisp fairly clean as long as it stays chilled corn taste with a miniscule hop presence light bodied well carbonated mouthfeel leading to a short lived finish
1751,Bud Light,3.15,lookpale copper closer to yellow white fizzy rapidly dissipating head smelllight hint of hop and grass and light citrus grain corn tastea sweet note after the bitter start melting to a sweet drying losing its carb a little making it easy to swallow a light pilsner taste to me never cloying sweet feelthin as expected in a light pils or helles lagerfuller to me than expected overallthis was a gift and would probably never buy on its own not that it is bad but i have been buying beers for 30 years and this one i am sure i have never purchased but that is mehaha so many other options that i prefer but overall not a bad beer i have had plenty worse than this and were allegedly made better
1752,Bud Light,3.66,i drink lower alcohol beers now and this is that overall crisp and refreshing price is right
1753,Bud Light,2.24,on tap pours a light gold colour with some faint grainy smells taste is a watery beer taste that does not improve bud heavy us much better throw a few olives in to make it palatable
1754,Bud Light,1,the original piss water
1755,Bud Light,1,awful
1756,Bud Light,3.8,on a hot summers day nothing goes better than a bud light at 799 a 12 pack bottleswhats to complain about oh yeah its woke who cares drink up
1757,Bud Light,1.05,crap in a can
1758,Sharp's,1.17,water with color barely any aroma or flavors
1759,Sharp's,2.25,from notes looks like miller smells like miller tastes like miller with water chaser then another water to wash it down feels too light to count as beer overall i dont know this isnt my thing
1760,Sharp's,1.5,i didnt think i would have anything good to say about odouls but its a damn site better than this even for a low alcohol brew this is just not good i really do not like the taste and cant get past that
1761,Sharp's,3,bottle ran me 099  mediumbodied but lacking in flavour amber malt 6 rowpale malt malt extract  certainly drinkable it has a nice albeit shallow flavour a dependable nonalcoholic beer but not something anyone would likely crave probably better than odouls but do we really care  high c  average
1762,Sharp's,2.23,12 oz can  pours clear pale straw yellow with a decent white head and lacing for the style  the smell is of well what little smell there is is of not much maybe some grain or adjunct corn clean  the taste is of not much there is something that hints towards grain an odd chemicalish something in the very brief finish  watery and not terribly fizzy crisp as tonic water  there are much better na brews out there this has virtually nothing to it except water and some bubbles  i had this on a clean palate and i am not congested this is too mild even for a macro na adjunct lager
1763,Sharp's,1.38,look murky yellow with a lot of carbonation feel fizzy malty and light taste sweet and malty a bit like pear cider tastes like flat beer smell apple juice and malted corn
1764,Sharp's,2.68,pours a yellow color with a lot of carbonation and a nice head the smell is of grains mostly corn and the taste is the same mouthful is watery but ok overall it is ok to drink just a bit to watered down for me
1765,Sharp's,3.93,good beer taste for non alcohol beer of course im not real picky on taste as much as i am price paid about 10 and some change for a 12 pack of cans it gets the job done
1766,Kalik,2.55,my son brought me this from his recent trip to the islands with his honey poured from a bottle and into a beer mug this beer is has a light golden color with a little head the aroma was really skunky and it followed through to the taste all in all it was not a good beer for my taste i will not be trying this again unless there is nothing else to drink
1767,Kalik,2.98,12oz clear glass bottle poured out a crystal clear strawyellow color with a small white head of foam it left some lacing on the glass it smelled of caramel toasted corn and floral notes sweet caramel taste with cracker sweet breads and a very mild bitterness
1768,Kalik,1.1,drainpour
1769,Kalik,2.18,when in the bahamas do as the bahamians do  and drinking an islander not named corona seemed like a good deal to me on vacation just a few weeks ago like a lot of things in life it may look good but things can get a bit crazy once you actually commit a lot of skunk from this guy and a bit harsh on the mouth but not a bad overall taste not the worst but definitely definitely not the best
1770,Kalik,1.15,this beer had a sweetness about it i just didnt like it was also kind of cloudy not sure why a aal would be cloudy i would take about any other aal over this one
1771,Kalik,2.5,i had one on tap while on my honeymoon in the bahamas it was watery and inoffensive it is typical to its style an island aal so i wouldnt penalize it for that however even for the style i wasnt too impressed with the taste and flavor it is versatile and works with many meals however it isnt a good mouthfeel the color is decent
1772,I Let My Tape Rock,4.5,bba from wakefest 2022 pours dark and fairly thick minimal head has some coconut floaters massive chocolate aroma mixes with light coffee and sweet vanilla coconut lingers on the finish flavor is molten chocolate espresso lava cake chocolate covered coconut flakes i get a little cherry cordials on the finish thick and creamy yet there is a hint of lively carbonation overall an amazing beer a year old and the coconut is still there  4523 bomber 45 rating
1773,I Let My Tape Rock,4.8,batch 1 glad to have tried this coconut dreamboat coconut rocks abound plus rich vanilla cocoa maple and awesome rye to balance everything out super thicc old school jwb mouthfeel super impressed by this gem
1774,I Let My Tape Rock,4.69,had in 2018 was probably my favorite j wakefield to date great collaboration of flavors and enjoyed this a lot thought feel could have been a little better
1775,Sol,5,i may drink too much choice of alcohol is lager beers thats it have tried most oof them except the crappy ones like natural ice lots of bud light and modelo and corona this beer tastes like nothing to me but tastes like something good that doesnt taste like any other lager out there i really like modelo but this beer is even easier to drink for me has a flavor that is not crappy but there is no flavor to it that makes it very easy to crush for me
1776,Sol,4.11,from a clear bottle dates 0224 pours a nice gold colour head doesnt last smell is wet grains and some malt taste is sweeter with grainsome light white bread good for style
1777,Sol,2.7,sol is good dont be a snob
1778,Sol,2.53,new mexican lager to me clear 12oz bottle accompanying my chile coloradopale strawcolored and completely transparent with minimal head and lacing adjunct sweetness shines though not altogether badgrains sweet maltsnot mad at this for a mexicanfood companion
1779,Sol,2.23,i was surprised i had not reviewed this beer before poured from a bottle into a tall pint glass clear yellow color with decent initial white head and lacing doesnt smell like much a bit of corn taste is boring corny but slightly refreshing very thin rather have a corona
1780,Sol,1.4,calling this stuff beer is like calling a veggie burger a steak however due to the low alcohol content it might be not too bad on a very hot day
1781,Sol,1.47,looks clear and light golden almost no smell at all slight slight skunky cornbread smell in there very light taste of carbonated water and hints of beer this is not for me
1782,Sol,3,the look is light golden hay smells sweet and mildly hoppy taste is solid only beaten imo by dos equis for mexican beer overall a solid mexican beer however based on price would not be a go to
1783,Sol,2.84,poured from a 32oz caguama bottle best by january 2023  on the pour fizzy looking bubbles come together to make a one finger head that quickly dissipates to a surprisingly fine covering over the top of the beer the body is a light gold with lots of carbonation and some very light lacing  smell is very light and almost not there bit what i can pick up is just corny malts and some skunked hops from the clear bottle at least its clean apart from being light struck  taste is a bit of a let down once again very light right on the very first sip there is a hit of bitterness that implies hops but that quickly fades as you drink and get used to it there is a certain minerality and tartness as well that lingers until the malts fully take over about halfway into the sip the hops dont taste fresh at all and are only providing bitterness and grass flavors one again very clean with almost no yeast notes  feel is actually decent being very drinkable and has some actual body to it although it is still very light once you get past the carbonation and head stage of the sip the finish isnt as short as i wouldve expected for a beer this light amd it leaves you feeling malty and a bit boozy for a decent while after your sip  overall its alright you can do better from mexico but its about on par with all the other clear bottles that come from down there victoria and tecate are both better and tecate is the same style too
1784,Sol,3,drunk during my trip to silao guanajuato m√©xico usual bottle of the brand  l clear pale yellow an some gold on top a thin head of white foam about 2 cm tall good collar and lacing  s peaches bread some corn  t more grain than bread malt it has a lingering peach aftertaste that is good no major hop in the brew  f light with a small amount of bigbubbled carbonation after a while it comes off as heavier than a lightweight  o a light brew i like it usual mexican beer
1785,Bud Light Lime Apple-Ahhh-Rita,4.25,great fall beverage and this one taste just like a caramel apple and drinking is just as delicious as eating on i would drink this one over and over in the fall
1786,Bud Light Lime Apple-Ahhh-Rita,3.6,i have been winnowing down the bottle backlog here at chez woody at the expense of the canquest tm when i realized that i have never reviewed this gem in a 25fl oz can mmmm  from the can limited fall edition margarita with a twist try it over ice  i really miss the aural aspect of cans when i am reviewing bottles so the crack in this case was music to my ears the size of the can was too beaucoup for me to canduct an inverted glug so i used a gentler version to decant the beer into my glass it was very effervescent but it produced no head whatsoever it was very fizzy though color was a beautiful goldenamber srm   5  7 with neplus quality clarity the gelt gang of mammon midas and croesus stopped by for a taste and i used the time to smell it it had a sweet apple juiceapple cider smell so i give them points for truth in advertising mouthfeel was thin watery with a fizziness that i found interesting it was very much alcopop and no wonder they felt canpelled to label it as contains alcohol since it would be easy to get carried away with this at 8 phew the taste was unmistakably apple but it was not as sweet as the nose had led me to expect we drank a bunch ciders last night but they were very dry while this was more semidry the finish was pleasant semidry and not as bad as i might have thought more damning with faint praise
1787,Cafe Y Churro,4.07,canned on 1122 consumed on 13122  pours a foggy burnt orange body topped with just over a finger of fluffy white foam solid head retention leaves islands of creamy cap along with a moderate frothy collar and a generous spatter of spotty lacing spread around the walls of the glass  aroma features creamy vanilla amplifying the sturdy cream ale base as it absorbs fresh diner coffee with a touch of cinnamon grazing for nuance a clean composition for a vivid and evocative bouquet  taste shows a hint of vanilla and fresh coffee bean as cinnamon edges coffee roast on the midpalate building to a residual presence of sweet corn and bready malt lingering past the finish  mouthfeel offers a medium body with moderatelow fluffy carbonation dispersing creamy textures into a roasty tingle over the midpalate a level silky character maintains with a subtle grit progressing into a cleaner finish  maybe the most direct of the series these adjuncts flow seamlessly into the base regular coffee scheme presenting a coherent image of cinnamon infusion countering a naturally sweet and creamy underbelly while maintaining the taut balanced drinkability paraamount in the style
1788,Cafe Y Churro,4.32,canned 1122  alrighty weve landed at our final destination in this horizontal tasting the 1 rated cream ale this one is definitely the most low key in terms of adjuncts of all the ones ive sampled this weekend but maybe its beauty lies in its simplicity lets see if its worth of such high praise  pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  well the cinnamon definitely gives this one more of a presence in the nose but its equally smoothed out by the vanilla im picking up on aromas of creamy coffee earthy cinnamon coriander french vanilla doughy malt honey and light toffee  this is also quite good in taste the cinnamon makes itself known but doesnt overstep on the front end of the sip im tasting cinnamon bark light roast coffee sweet cream vanilla light white pepper and nutty malt the swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon acidic coffee coriander nutty malt vanilla caramel and light cream  a medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth beer finishes mostly dry and dries even more over time because of the cinnamon probably the most drinkable of the series because of this  this was one hell of a ride through adjuncted cream ales to get me through a blizzard this one and coffee  pavlova kiwi  strawberry were definitely the frontrunners of the series worthy of the title and im excited to try more variants in the future in the meantime ive had enough of the style this weekend time to get to some other beers i picked up from carton
1789,Cafe Y Churro,4.44,appearance  the beer poured a golden color with visible carbonation and a white head  smell  cinnamon and some coffee are noted in the nose it was obvious that this beer had some spice  taste  oh my regular coffee is obvious but the spice of the cinnamon sparkles with the hint of cinnamon it really created the idea of drinking a churro the cinnamon is not overdone or a mess of spices i believe the beer could benefit from a bit more cinnamon spice the coffee profile was not overshadowed by the adjuncts especially in the finish  mouthfeel  the body was so smooth even with fairly aggressive carbonation  overall  i think i like regular coffee the best however this is my favorite variant
1790,Cafe Y Churro,4.13,thick slightly hazy orange with a 5 inch excellent lacing throughout nose is sweet cream light malts touch of vanilla but didnt catch any cinnamon taste follows with rich milk and cream notes rounded malts small amount of hop bitterness to even it out whiff of cinnamon on the finish but very slight for me feel is rich and creamy with no hint of the 12 abv a remarkably smooth beer with the only knock being the elusive cinnamon
1791,Cafe Y Churro,4.56,thank you y2kawakami for this 12 oz can dated 121516 poured into a teku  a a slightly hazy copper with a small white head  s cinnamon some coffee caramel some vanilla smells like a churro with some coffee  t cinnamon some vanilla coffee caramel touch of chocolate  m smooth medium to full body  o wow carton nailed it with the churro flavor very easy to drink
1792,Cafe Y Churro,4.25,pours a somewhat opaque burnished orange color thin offwhite head dissipates pretty quickly leaving no residual head appearance appears to be in line with the style  aroma has notes of coffee vanilla light cream notes and a lovely bouquet of cinnamon the cinnamon is just delicious  taste follows the nose with notes of coffee and vanilla up front all interspersed with some lovely cinnamon notes that linger through to the finish its sweet but not overly so  feel is light not exactly crisp but its clean semidry finish  overall this continues the series unique take on the cream ale style the cinnamon and vanilla in this one are outstanding though definitely my favorite example of the coffee series ive had
1793,Cafe Y Churro,4.09,wow this is quite the interesting one looks still as cider in the glass its rare that coffee works well in a pale ale but this is one of those times the sugary toasty churro character comes through nicely to balance things out almost like a coffee barleywine but also kinda reminds me of pumpking  82100
1794,Cafe Y Churro,4,dark amber brew with an offwhite head minimal production and ok retention body is lively despite the activity and deep color its perfectly transparent  coffee cinnamon and vanilla on the nose decadent and rich sweet and inviting just a bit of a cream soda note going on  flavor follows sweet creamy and smooth cinnamon provides a large portion of the flavor accents and the vanilla blends smoothly with cream and coffee notes less bite than other amber coffee ales or coffee cream ales quite a dessert beer  creamy body very smooth and drinkable no sense of the high abv until you notice the heat building in your throat
1795,Cafe Y Churro,4.56,pours a golden color with a half finger of quickly disappearing head the nose is cinnamon coffee vanilla and some caramel the taste follows the nose vanilla cinnamon and coffee with some bitterness on the finish low carbonation smooth and easy to drink with a creamy mouthfeel the 12 is not noticeable
1796,Cafe Y Churro,4.4,transparent copper with a finger and a half of foam head is offwhite in color and is wellretained aroma is cinnamon vanilla bean mediumroast mediumbodied coffee and nutty earthy caramely malts sweetness right up front with just a sliver of coffee bitterness bringing it back to balance flavor profile is cinnamon vanilla bean mediumroast fruity bodied coffee and nutty earthy caramely malts sweetness starts and closes out the flavor profile with a light bitterness from the coffee striking a modest balance in the center alcohol is well hidden in the flavor profile which is rather surprising considering the 12 abv mouth feel is lightly crisp with a velvety mediumthick consistency beyond it overall sugary sweet with a good hit of coffee balances leans heavily towards the dessert side which is to say  overall this thing is sweet the fact that the alcohol is well masked boosts the rating here just slightly  served in a 155oz spiegalau tulip from a 12oz can
1797,Cafe Y Churro,4.39,can you be in cuba and mexico at the same time with this beer you can tastes of a sweet cortalito but you enjoy that with a freshly fried churro from mexico city if you like coffee and desserts this will win you over
1798,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),2.5,poured from a julian dated 24oz can  on a rough pour 3 fingers of white almost decent if not a bit foamy white head formed then becomes rocky and recedes to just under 1cm body is a clear but relatively dark gold with lots of carbonation somehow lacing does form at an acceptable level but the bubbles are larger than normal  aroma is enjoyably vague as if it were any more potential smelling it would be indistinguishable from an extremely cheap and old white wine slight 6row sweetness somewhere in the but it doesnt meld very well  flavor is somehow better than the aroma and honestly much better than expected still the tart cheap white wine thing is still there right up front before fading to a surprisingly light bit present malty lager flavor there is a slight bitterness that pops in at the beginning then quickly disappears likely an off flavor  feel is surprisingly light for the style not to call it drinkable but when cold it does come off as a little refreshing assuming you have nothing to do as it warms it does begin to linger more  overall despite its obvious flaws i would definitely call this a pleasant surprise for not completely offending my taste buds definitely put it in the freezer before consuming but also definitely better than the camo malt liquors
1799,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),2.4,its alright when you stop tasting it
1800,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),3.9,it has a diffrence between the 81 and the 12  i like the 12 better but wonder what is the truth so lol cheap is what cheap gets idk 8 or 10 or 12 whatever they print i like it  it is a good one ptr 91
1801,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),3.34,24 ounce can into ipa glass canned on 442022 pours slightly hazy pale golden straw color with a 23 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers dense foamy lacing clings on the glass with a good amount of streaming carbonation this was not too bad aromas and flavors of big plum pear red apple corn cereal white bread herbal wood grass light pepper and yeast earthiness super fruity dms nose as it warmed light herbalgrassy bitterness and slight alcohol spiciness on the finish mediumhigh carbonation lightmedium body and fairly crispclean finishing balanced breadygrainy malt and sticky hops in the mouthfeel light lingering bitter dryness no cloyingastringency very easy to drink and pretty clean on lager flavors but the aftertaste lingers with dms and its a bit much otherwise really minimal warming after the finish for 10 i actually kind of regret buying this haha it was cheap though good for a buzz and nothing else by design it also has some kind of distinct yeast or grain note that seems to be common with the four loko lineup the can says drink four brewing does make this
1802,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),3.01,it smells damn near like turpentine or rubbing alcohol doesnt have the same friendly taste of basically any other lager despite saying high gravity lager in its name its even more different than hurricane or steel reserve which have less harsh aftertaste but still more redeemable than smirnoff beer which is almost unbearable in taste the real standout here is that once you sip or chug this puppy you get blitzed but not so fcked up as four loko which has amazing output but results in unintended hurling which killed its potential early on not what id call a great malt liquor if thats what youre looking for the best tasting beer thus far would seem to be oe but it doesnt have the impact this thing has definitely more of a i wanna be loaded but not to the point of hangover scenario i dont even get why someone would wanna keep drinking after having this thats the type of experience it induced if you want to be honest in my opinion
1803,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),2.39,tastes like ass but love the kick so mix it with bloody mary mix etc
1804,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),2.52,like a typical american strong ale alcohol and corn sweetness on the nose clear yellow appearance strong alcohol flavor with a bit of malt no hops to be found for booze hounds only
1805,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),2.44,l fairly nice clear gold with a hint of amber and a quickly dissolving head s light sweet corn with raw alcohol t sweet corn bubble gum apple and pear juices background alcohol f rough  dry on the tongue with a noticable burn slick and sweet going down but the burn lingers on o not awful for what it is quite passable if you drink it cold with spicy food
1806,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),2.96,appearance deep gold color clear not much head no lace  aroma grainy corny strongly alcoholic no hops to discern  flavor clean grainy corny and alcoholically sweet dies out in the finish with some apple bubblegum and pear notes  mouthfeel prickly mediumlight body and a bit hot on the tongue like you would expect  overall for what it is it is not that bad but it is not great beer by any standard has fewer offflavors than you would expect
1807,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),2.75,yellow fizzy drink light body mostly grain flavor quite sweet strong alcohol taste maybe i ve turned into a beer snob i probably would have enjoyed this while in college but not anymore definitely not finishing the whole can at least i can mark this off from trying one of every style
1808,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),2.83,24oz can poured into a bells tulip glass  a  poured a clear gold with minimal head that faded quickly and left no lacing  s  notes of malt caramel and corn high abv is noticeable on the nose but not overwhelming  t  caramel and grain up front with a sweet finish that fades slowly to leave a residual boozy bitterness at the back of the throat slight apple notes appear as the beer warms  m  lightbodied with high carbonation gets heavier as it warms becomes a bit difficult to drink over time  o  decent for the style and has a cool can design but i would not go out of my way to have it again tick completed
1809,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),2.45,24oz can date code undecipherable poured into 16oz tulip poured a bright clean clear gold color with 13 inch of white head that almost immediately dissipated and left no lacing  the aroma was the expected sweet grain no hops and sharp alcohol  worse on the tongue a lot of apple sweetness and harsh alcohol  the body was light crisp a bit harsh and a finish that hot and sweet  drinkability was a bit of a chore especially with the size of the format  overall not the worst cheap malt liquor ive tried but not the best either tickers special
1810,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),5,very strong beer i like to cook with it
1811,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),5,this is the best cheap beer ive ever had its very smooth with just the right amount of carbonation and flavor i highly recommend this high gravity lager
1812,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),1.69,sorry i even put this vile crud in my system but i was down to pocket change when i got off work look isnt bad average above average carbonation not an unoffensive appearance but the smell straight from the can was awful stringent alcohol mixed with overcooked corn no hops smells just sour rancid grains corn taste is awful rubbing alcoholish taste smell grains slightly on the nose very slightly earthy as in landfill earth not all that grand carries over all the way around drink it ice cold if it gets warm and you try to chug it on a dare pray to the porcelain gods jackwagon this stuff is great for 2 bucks ice cold to get a job done nothing more would buy again if my wife stole my bank card again and i had nothing but pocket change and was desperate
1813,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),4.77,this stuff taste like an ice beer but with more punch i tried it and honestly i see this as a strong lager i had old english and natty daddy this stuff to me is sweet for a 109 definitely will get it in the future
1814,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),3.66,look  clean corn yellow with medium foam when poured but leaves rather quickly  smell  very strong sweet and lingering smell from the can or glass  taste  very sweet corn like taste with a great after taste  overall  this is a killer malt liquor and is very cheap my go to when i dont want a steel reserve i am biased cause i really do love malt liquor however this is great beer compared to most malts and cheap beers
1815,Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),4.12,look i have always been a fan of high gravity lagers founders dkml was amazing fresh though like most founders beers didnt last past the one year mark dont get me started thats an discussion for another day this beer excelent and to rate it poor here is beyond you snobby morons because for an 10 abv 24 oz lager for 150 this is amazing  not just the price but the look is very cool refreshing and very carbonated pop the cap and the first smell and taste is very tart which holds up pretty damn well over the course of the 24 oz an high gravity lager tart and refreshing and very excellent garth or is that wayne doesnt matter overall outstanding and anyone rating it lower is an snob
1816,Great,4.04,12oz bottle served in a spiegelau snifter vintage is probably circa 2014 pours the color and clarity of unpasteurized apple cider perhaps a hue darker not he just a thin broken band around the shoulders nose is robust  big hit of figs followed by ethanol and perhaps a trace of oxidationsoy sauce in the background taste consistent with nose  figs are a bit more candied in the flavor profile middle is earthy with a suggestion of chocolate and finishes with prunes and a light medicinal bitterness mouthfeel is medium in body with a still carbonation overall a little past its prime not much of a suggestion of the barrel however still quite drinkable
1817,Great,4.44,2013 vintage consumed on 3232022  pours a stunning pitchchestnut an almost inky appearance giving way to slight ruby accents as a bubbly halffinger of pale tan head forms slowly fizzing out to a sparse cap expansive frothing collar and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass  aroma offers immediate impressions of jammy plum refining focus to fig subtle caramel and toffee over time as an evocative dark fruit overload springs forth across the bouquet bourbon on the back end encourages a touch of cherry and lighter cocoa to engage the close  taste opens to layers of sugar plum raisin dates and bits of brown sugar growing in accents of bold fig and burnt caramel into the midpalate oaky vanilla meets fruitcake on the back end while leathery chocolate dusts a barrel edge with slight bourbon and smoked toffee finishing  mouthfeel shows a medium body dense and concentrated silky textures foundational beneath a lowlying carbonation smooth wispy grit guides to a mild twang underscoring a vague burgeoning oxidation into midpalate followed by a mild barrel char and steady warmth on the back end with some stickiness into the otherwise velvety finish  belying most any sense of experiencing time and age this is a rich comprehensive american barleywine a deft composition of ultrabold fruits calm barrel inflection and leathery resins encapsulating a consuming classic apex of the style

1822,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,5,my favorite beer by far i know its sweet and some may say its not a beer i dont care i love that it tastes great unlike any of the other ritas ive tried i just wish i could find it in the texoma area
1823,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,2.21,pours a headless orange yellow nose is canned mango juice and nectar and unlike other entrants in the rita series does a good job of hiding the booze taste follows nectar dominant and only on the finish does the cheap alcohol begin to raise its head of the ritas ive sampled the best of a sad bunch
1824,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,4.71,mangorita has lots of fizzy bubbles and no foam nor lacing the appearance is opaque orange the aroma is of mangoes and pale malt and the flavor is the same with a splenda brand sweetness mouthfeel is medium and mangorita finishes highfructose corn syrup drying its topnotch for what it is but i just dont like what it is  rjt
1825,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,3.16,25 oz can code 19173 purchased cold poured into a 28 oz mug  l as is typical with this line shaking my head being too familiar with it but only reviewcently hazy liquid with a fizzy fleeting foam liquid color is almost on par with irn bru or an igloo cooler  s mango jolly rancher  nothing more to add  t mango soda syrup bit of spectrum swipe of medicinal phenolic saccharine flavors in the finish intensely sugary flavorful but only 10 malt liquorish if that  f slight fuzzy fizz on contact vaguely drawnoutslick like a flat soda halfway through extra 14 pt for the ethanol being super smooth  o another gapfilling review flavorassaulting softdrinky fizzy liquid boozy candy like a fizzy boones farm thang at this age i rarely try to get drunk but id hate to be reduced to relying on this to take me away blech 1529
1826,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,1.54,whoo boy this one is something in my earlier drinking days id go grab one of these and down it while i watched my friend kelly stream games it was an abhorrent experience for the most part every swig made my face contort and exhale like a noob drinker  overwhelming fruity smell the overall taste is artificial mango cheap margarita mix like what they put in the dollaritas at applebees and beer water syrupy as it gets i only punished myself with this a few times and apparently the other flavors are worse so i guess i should be thankful not sure why i ever had one more than once
1827,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,5,love this but cant find it in stores
1828,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,2.4,is it ok to essentially start a review with well this is the least shitty variation of this beer i think its a good summary of the review anyways pours as usual looking nothing like beer looks more like some tonic water with nothing but alka seltzer and some coloring added what a weird fizzy creation aroma was slightly mangoesque so it didnt miss the mark by much there  taste the mango character is also there in the taste but its all downhill after hitting that extract still super fizzy lacks a malt yeast or hop aspect of the beer but hey this hits that adjunct spot with some sugar added in to cover up the alcohol its nowhere near as offputting as the lime one is

1850,Leffe Blonde,3.77,112 ounce bottle poured into ahem an opaque plastic cup at a french bistro in aventura mall in florida best by may 2024 so its fresh 66 abv big ole thick creamy head pops up and crowns aroma of familiar belgian yeast mild clove little perfumey taste is pretty spot on for a belgian blond herbs clove touch of banana light malt a vanilla note tad of bitter feel is joyously middense active carbonation overall right fine accent to an almond croissant will stand up on its own too
1851,Leffe Blonde,3.73,after a dip in form for this brewery theres been a big improvement in quality again imo nicely balanced and carbonated yeasty and slightly spicy notes taste follows with slight honey and a woody and bready finish decent feel and a decent blond comparatively for a macro brewery glad to see its on the up again
1852,Leffe Blonde,3.08,yields a golden color with a big froth head atop  smells of wet wood cardamom and unripe green banana among notes of allspice and dried grass  has a light body with a well accentuated higher carbonation level revealing a mineralic quality leading to a well working refreshment  tastes of honey melting toffee and rustic grains among soothing bread dough and a faint note of dry leaves offers a sprizzy middle part with the beers carbonation becoming more prominent together a sweet rock sugar malt backbone finishes with a mineralic burst more honey and a prevailing maltiness  solid blond with a convincing balance to it
1853,Leffe Blonde,4.09,put off trying this for years assuming id drink it in europe one day and indeed i have snagged a tall can in paris most of the beer here is belgian naturally this is enjoyable especially considering the average score yeasty funky and slightly spicy quite good would drink again a 66 can with a best by date of 122024
1854,Leffe Blonde,3.46,rereviewing as it was a long time since i reviewed thiswill review the brune nextcool bottle design used to drink this a lot in the past and it was one of my favorite beers though these were the days of being brought up surrounded by lagers and diamond whiteso this was my first taste of a real beer  aside from stella this must be the 2nd most mass produced beer from belgium i think i used to drink it lots in australiaas australian beers are usually pretty terrible  good creamy froth that stays in the glass some quite large bubbles aroma is banana and cloves  flavour has elements of soy sauce haha i always thought this there is a herbiness coming through and elements of orange peel cloves lemon peel and more soy sauce its not as complex as the best belgian beers but considering this is mass produced by inbev its still pretty good but it lacks the mouth feel and complexity of an unpasteurized trappist ale according to the bottle it contains added vanilla also now that i have read this i can taste a little vanilla   but banana is more noticeable there is a little vanilla in the aftertaste  the taste isnt particularly smoothits kind of angry and chaoticand it tastes like it contains more alcohol than it actually does a westervelen 12 or rochefort 10 both taste like they contain less alcohol than this  very good but not quite great happy to drink this again though from memory sometimes the bottles actually go bad before you drink them so be careful or maybe this was just my dads cellar the flavour is a bit too soy saucy for me though still one of the best mass produced beers out there for sure  ok onwards to the brune  
1855,Leffe Blonde,1,this was my favourite beer of all time for over 10yrs unfortunately the rights were sold to a brazilian brewer who immediately set about destroying it its been dropped from 66 to 60 and the original flavour is a past memory tastes of very little but a revolting metallic after taste and its also now heavily carbonated and holds no head whatsoever  this is headed for 45 and in the gutter with pissy heineken etc i kind of knew it was going bad the moment they switched from corks to metal caps on the 750ml btls a few years later theyve proved me right  some of the home keg sellers still have 66 kegs my advice is to snap them up theyre the last of the original  absolute shame that this once fantastic beer has been sold out
1856,Leffe Blonde,4.15,330ml bottle in vientiane laos pours a clear light amber aroma of malt light hops clove and sweet fruitslight acidity lightly bitter medium body watery texture moderate carbonation a good belgian ale deserving of its popularity
1857,Leffe Blonde,3.55,poured from a 330ml bottle  6   not sure whats going on with the lower abv  brewed for uk market perhaps pours a dark amber  very bubbly and a large bubbled  off white head the smell is belgian yeast and vague honey and the taste follows on with a slight added fruitiness the mouthfeel is too syrupy not awful but not good overall this isnt as good as it used to be but maybe it would be if i got the 66 beer this feels like a dumbing down of a previously much better beer though disappointed
1858,Leffe Blonde,3.13,its not bad for the price but it is not in the same league as a great belgian blonde like delirium tremens the ba score of 81 is generous it lacks crispness and finishes a little too sweet the body is light but it retains a head and creates good lacing heavy hops are not expected in this style but it could use more bitterness overall it tastes like a massproduced belgian ale which is exactly what it is
1859,Leffe Blonde,4.1,bottle from johns poured into tulip glass just a very solid belgian blonde and i love me some belgians
1860,Sip Of Sunshine,3.57,i cannot believe that this beer is so highly rated it is good but far from world class
1861,Sip Of Sunshine,4.75,poured from the pounder into a nonic pint  a relatively clear straw gold with a nice thick head that dissipates to a wispy collar and a few islands of thin clouds  s tropical fruit and some lemongrass hints no strong malts to speak of  t beautiful bitter notes of underripe stonefruit and pineapple  m smooth and slick with a good bit of dryness then a slick finish  o if i ever had a near 5ish this is it in ipas
1862,Sip Of Sunshine,3.84,like but its vermont cousins at the alchemist are still better
1863,Sip Of Sunshine,4.27,on tap bright golden yellow with a brighter white head of sticky foam good staying power and lacing aroma is clean and softly sweet hints of lemon and sugar dusted pineapple this beer smiles and invites you in politely flavor is balanced mix of lagerlike malt and white pepper hop bite long and mellow hop character in balance with the mild sweet roll flavors and stewed fruit notes with just a hint of alcohol clean balanced and well made is the best way to describe this very sessionable but slightly boring big beer
1864,Sip Of Sunshine,4.51,poured from a bottle into a pint glass appearance  the beer pours a clear golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam the head has a decent level of retention fading over time and leaving a moderate sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass smell  the aroma is very strong of a sweet grapefruit and tangerine smell mixed with notes of papaya and some herb there is also a rather strong peach and apricot smell mixed with some lighter smells of pear and biscuit malt taste  the taste begins with a nice smooth tangerine and bready malt flavor mixed with the grapefruit hop that was in the nose there is a touch of herbal and pine hop at the start as well but these are very light in comparison to the grapefruit hop flavor other flavors of a light honeydew melon and a decent showing of mango and papaya are there as well with the ladder fruit getting more intense as the taste advances a light floral hop and a bit of grain develop at the very end leaving one with a smooth and rather citrus strong taste to linger on the tongue mouthfeel  the body of the brew is on the lighter and thinner side for a 8  abv brew with a moderate carbonation for the big citrus and fruit flavors the feel is quite nice making for a nice and dangerously easy sipper overall  a very pleasant drinking citrus forward and highly flavorful ipa a quite well crafted and very tasty brew
1865,Sip Of Sunshine,4.4,poured into a seattle beer week pint glass pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a three finger offwhite head with good retention and nice lacing aroma of caramel malt citrus and tropical fruit hops orange pineapple and mixed tropical fruit and a little pine flavor is lightly caramel malt citrus tropical fruit an piney hops grapefruit and orange rind pine needles mild mixed tropical fruit and some dankness a somewhat different piney and citrus rind flavor develops in the finish with great aggressive bitterness medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess i guess with the market domination of hazy ne style ipas out here in the west i kinda thought the east coast would be a wasteland of hazies ive been lucky enough to get several fine ipas from out east and im now convinced that good old nonhazies are available there too this is a fine example not quite a west coast profile but lots of the citrus and pine i crave lots of herbal hop flavor i am especially happy about the flavor change about midtaste where strong pine takes over from the citrus and fruit but a somewhat different mixed fruit note is revealed behind the almost resinous pine appropriately namedthis is a bright cheerful ipa id love to drink again
1866,Sip Of Sunshine,4.25,sorry to report because it will be even harder to snap up when it gets to local shelves sip of sunshine is a great ipa it is fkn delicious
1867,Crazy Stallion,3.44,for the price its a decent beer i like the size i am afraid though that as it becomes more popular esp with the homeless the price will go up quick already raised a quarter
1868,Crazy Stallion,2.84,this is a review of a 24 oz can from the bottom of the can cl01723 1752 fl  appearance it has a nice warm gold colored body with excellent clarity it is a beautiful looking beer it starts out with a short white head but it doesnt last long at all it quickly drops out to nothing there is no lacing on the beer other than a few spots of bubbles that are so sparse you could count them individually aside from the lack of a sustained head or any lacing it is a gorgeous looking beer  aroma there is a very very very light hop aroma which smells a bit like noble hops there is also a very light aroma of what smells like vinyl its not a very good smelling beer  taste there is a light noble hop character up front with a light hint of caramel towards the middle the flavor increases a bit and there is a touch of walnut with some more herbal notes although these flavors increase the overall flavor profile is still very mellow and the beer tastes watered down there isnt any real flavor towards the back of the palate and the aftertaste is just this light walnut flavor  mouthfeel it tastes very light and watered down it is very easy to drink the can doesnt appear to list any abv but it is important to note that there is no perceived alcohol in either the flavor or the mouthfeel of the beer so it hides the abv very well  overall this beer isnt going to win any prizes for being flavorful or aromatic but it has a nice walnut aftertaste and it is very easy to drink the label simply calls this a classic lager and it is an easy drinking lager it has a bit of a vinyl aroma but that was so subtle that it is only noticeable when you are trying to pick out an aroma from the beer when drinking this normally it doesnt come through  normally i wouldnt mention prices but this one has 150 printed on the can itself its not a bad buy if you can get it for that price and just want a cheap and easy drinking lager i would recommend it to those who are looking for a cheap beer thats easy to drink i probably wouldnt buy this regularly but if i could get it for 150 i might buy a few to throw in a cooler with some hotdogs for a cheap camping meal
1869,Crazy Stallion,3.53,clear medium gold body very nice carbonation very little head thin and patchy weak aroma faint grain scent fairly bold grain flavor and sweetness corn mild hop bitterness medium body smooth with a slight velvet feel and a mild warmth  not a bad lager for what it is  poured at 58 f the can label lists this is now a classic lager and brewed by hornell brewing co part of ferolito vultaggio  sons if i understand things correctly
1870,Crazy Stallion,3.24,this is an ok beer for 125 better than most
1871,Crazy Stallion,3.43,serve it really cold and pour it into a glass and its not bad at all
1872,Crazy Stallion,3.32,for a beer thats only 070 per 12 ounces is absolutely nothing to complain about its better than most other cheap beers it is not going to win any awards you will be pleasantly surprised how it taste for being so cheap
1873,Crazy Stallion,3.31,this says lager on the 24oz can for 125 for 24 oz i was intrigued popping the top i get grape juice pour is classic amber with a weak head on the taste i get grape juice with angostura bitters like a weak old fashioned for 005 per oz i am not complaining not offensive and a great looking can i think i found a new chugged to hang at the bbq in 95 degrees
1874,Crazy Stallion,3.66,this isnt your normal type of beer for 125 this is a friendly type of beer many may say  oh it has a metallic taste but what were they drinking metal cant be compared to natty cause it doesnt taste water downed cant be compared to lets say heineken cause its a bit malt liqour this beer can hit the spot when youre in the dumps besides this the only other beer that can live up to it is the olde english 800 too bad they dont make 40 oz of this cause damn that would sure turn the market around god bless the us of a
1875,Crazy Stallion,3.31,was unexpectedly heading to the local commuter train and passed a bodega so i decided to grab a beverage to enjoy on my hour long trip i spied this wonderful looking 24 oz can in the cooler and was immediately inspired to take a closer look hand crafted the label said btw what do you call the outside of a can it isnt technically a label but i digress american made original even and a classic lager how could it get any better than in the upper left corner of the aforementioned label was the coup de grace 125 how could it be possible for such a highly touted product to be priced at such an inviting level and for 1 pt 8 fl oz of anticipated golden nectar it could only because prime example of american ingenuity at its finest i had to have it and have it now  caught my train by the skin of my teeth found a seat and prepared myself for the journey both in the physical and the emotional as the train departed the station i cracked open the plebian tab that stood between me and the experience i so longed to have  how to rate this libation how to describe it the question of look remains unexplored it is truly unfair to fault the beer for this so i fairly i feel out this required rating smack dab in the middle of the field how could one even consider using and vessel but the magnificent aluminum that naturally covers it luckily the aroma is able to we escape through the approximately inch wide circle created by the escape valve commonly referred to as the tab i can think of no other words to describe this than sickeningly sweet this is not a value judgement mind you but a descriptive fact a negative who am i to make such a judgement on an esteemed product like crazy stallion  but we know why you all are here to discover the taste the flavor how does crazy stallion tickle the tongue i can only confirm that i absolutely got my 125 actually 150 once you calculate the governments share of the experience of value and what more can one truly ask for indeed what more this crazy stallion was possibly one of the finest travelling companions i have ever had on a commuter rail journey
1876,Crazy Stallion,1.25,i picked up a 24oz tallboy at my local bodega for 125 i drank about half and poured the rest out has a awful sour metallic taste like its been sitting in the can for years i wont buy it again
1877,Crazy Stallion,2.95,125 for a 24 oz beer cant beat that these days i was pretty surprised how good this beer was tasted pretty good and if its 59 abv then that is amazing doesnt really taste like its 59 seems about maybe 5 or somewhere between 4 to 5 abv but it says 59 on here so i guess thats what it is  i was thinking this was gonna be more crazy than it was you know since it says crazy stallion i was thinking it would be some pretty good stuff like natty daddy but was quite mild for the name crazy stallion should probably just be called grazing stallion or something like that  taste reminds me of those cheap no brand beers they sell at some places that are about 4 to 5 abv taste reminds me of that cheap beer they sell at walgreens you get the 6 pack for like 3 or 4 dollars or something  the taste is pretty good for the price kind of a low carbonated flavor beer pretty decent the main thing is the type of buzz you get really which seemed to be like a sleepy beer had to take a nap felt drowsy after drinking this not really a stimulating beer but probably gonna definitely give it some more tries to see what its like some more maybe i may try this beer again but seems like that beer they sell at walgreens and has the same drowsy effect  this crazy stallion is like the arizona ice tea of beers pretty much cheap and its just beer
1878,Crazy Stallion,3.09,pours a clear goldenamber with a ton of head smell is hard to peg sort of a metallic malt taste is not as horrible as expected malty of course and mildly sweet not to boozy drink to get hammered not to have flavor extra credit for cool ass can
1879,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,3.83,great example of a michelada
1880,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,1.8,poured from a can into a pint glass appearance  the beer pours a murky tomato juice color with almost no head of foam smell  as would be expected the nose is heavy of a tomato juice and clamato smell mixed with these aromas is a light graininess and a touch of mustiness taste  the taste starts out with a quite sweet and salty clamato taste with a little bit of light breadiness this pretty much sums up the majority of the taste throughout not good mouthfeel  with the clamato the brew is slightly thicker and chewier with a lower carbonation overall  nope not going back to this one i sometimes like clamato in a light lager but this is over the top in clamato way too much and way to sweet and salty its a no go
1881,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,3.6,12 ounce can julian date 22056 feb 25 2022 stamped on the bottom of the can not sure if thats the canned on or best by date served in a pint glass the beer pours a hazy reddishpinkish color with about an inch pink colalike head that fizzled away pretty quick not much if any lacing at all the brew smells like tomato juice clamato salt and a bit of lime taste is similar to the aroma but theres some mineral and peppery flavors noticeable too mouthfeelbody is medium its a bit coating smooth and enjoyable to drink truthfully the longer i drink it the more i like it i dont know if its because of the clamato but this is a big improvement over the modelo chelada i had earlier today id definitely buy this one again
1882,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,1.41,24oz can shared amongst friends review from notes  i cant understand why some like these so much i guess im not big on clamato either but this is just nonpotable spoiled clamato and rotgut vodka are the dominating flavors
1883,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,4.29,i get that bud light michelada isnt for everybody because its for people who enjoy micheladas theres a reason why their line of micheladas keep growing to a half dozen or more these bad reviews are obviously from people who dislike micheladas which i find both humorous and absurd would you drink a sour or stout and think its great if you hate those styles of beer lmao cmon beer snobs use some common sense
1884,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,1.06,picked up from a drivethru liquor store as a tall boy for 299 poured into a tulip glass  l  thick nearsyrupy bright scarlet with a sort of opaqueness to it 1mm pale rust head that disappears nearly instantly s  v8 clams and gasoline mineral almost like salt slight rice backing t  heavy ethanol and lime notes lead way to even heavier clam and v8 flavors though barely noticeable rice and wheat are present black pepper finish f  viscous and barely carbonated o  before i could make out any flavor the first thing that came to my head was what the fuck did i just drink for the sake of being 100 fair with everything i drink and in recognition that this is likely an acquired taste i drank the whole thing  about two and a half glass pours first off its bad getting that out of the way its not as bad as youd first think it tastes like clamato and lime like a really terrible bloody mary i should note that bloody mary cocktails arent really my thing but i get the appeal this beer would definitely be better if it had some heat to it and a lot more black pepper maybe some celery i wont buy this again but its worth giving it a try
1885,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,3.82,a lot of people are not judging this michelada fairly this is a great michelada that is a higher abv than most other micheladas on the market the clamato adds a great flavor profile that is very refreshing and delicious my only complaint is that it could use some more lime flavor i sometimes add a slice of lime to this and it makes it even better
1886,Very Green,4.9,182 great
1887,Very Green,4.64,canned on august 21 poured on september 3  great smell when poured strong pineapple taste throughout the glass great beer
1888,Very Green,4.53,ive been drinking this one for years if you havent had it you need some of thisstat
1889,Very Green,4.08,appearance pours a cloudy goldenstraw with a two finger head strong retention and a few shards and squiggles linger  smell tropical notes of mango pineapple and orange rind dank and somewhat grassy  taste tropical fruit forward with the mango and pineapple leading the impression through the middle there is bitter orange rind the finish is a bit green might i say very green with a grassy aspect  mouthfeel meidum to full body and creamy moderate carbonation with some hop burn  overall decent but not among my favorites from tree house due to the hop burn in the finish i am somewhat surprised as i have really enjoyed the other beers i have tasted in the green series
1890,Quilmes,3.13,115 oz bottle enjoy by date 31424 into a tulip glass l pours clear rich golden caramel with a thin fizzy off white head low head retention minimal lacing s a hint of bread lightly floral background lighter fruits pastry dough t gently sweet dirty grains grassy hops very light fruit notes a hint of fruit zest and the back end of the finish and has a very light aftertaste of white grape f average thin and mediumlight bodied feel with a lightly assertive center and a fast drying finish o european in style and slightly dry drinks easily and is gently sweet good balance and brewery touts natural ingredients its okay in its style
1891,Quilmes,3.05,bottle pour into a tulip glass clear golden appearance with a modest soapy head that recedes quickly to a surface film and collar celery pepper metallic notes light body light carbonation
1892,Quilmes,3.52,340ml bottle best before 110523 so either 6 months from now or two weeks ago the beer pours bright light golden amber with off white head the head recedes to a pencil thin ring and island no lacing the aroma is mild with sweet grain the taste is semisweet pale malt with a hint of corny  vegetable flavor moderate bitterness the mouthfeel is thin bodied with just above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish overall good
1893,Quilmes,2.8,fizzy kinda sweet and malty whiz but when sitting at an argentinian restaurant with a plate full of comida it somehow works nothing id put a sixer in the fridge of though
1894,Quilmes,2.12,messi recommended it so blecch is it so difficult to steal one of our brewerys recipes and produce it they have all our military information decent carbonation though

1897,XXXX Gold,2.92,bottle 7 aud in port douglas australia  forgettable neutral fare with no faults  c  average
1898,XXXX Gold,5,during my visit to queensland i fell in love with xxxx gold now that i am back in the united states i cant find this beer anywhere if it is available in the states someone please let me know
1899,XXXX Gold,2.14,xxxx gold the midstrength heart and soul of australias yoyos with vb as the nations most popular beer but in queensland its holy water ive personally never liked it too watery too thin too tasteless but today im going to take my beer goggles off drop my snobberyayour thirst quickly easily with no fuss and not get you too smashed up in the unforgiving tropical heat that is queensland  look  255 the iconic gold can referred to as a mango in queensland drinking out of the can is known as sucking on a mango is pretty iconic and you gotta admit bright yellow can australia sunshine happiness poured into a standard ikea tumbler rough pour an extremely filtered clear golden colour slightly darker than the can itself frothy bubbly white soapsuds head its a classic aussie adjunct  smell  2255 corn wet grassy hops and bitterness provided by the pride of ringwood obviously some light biscuit malt ive smelt this time and time and time again mix and match any aussie adjunct lager  taste 25  cereal grain light bitterness from the hops light maltiness watery almost like im drinking a flavoured sparkling mineral water beer flavoured mineral water with a slight chemical aftertaste  feel 2255  highly carbonated watery thin but on a 35 degree 80 plus humidity day up in far north queensland thats what you need  overall outside of queensland the northern territory or northwestern western australia this is a terrible terrible beer i know its a midstrength lager but hell even great northern super crisp has a better overall flavour than xxxx gold however in those aforementioned months particularly during the summer months of the year this is an excellent brew its thin crisp enough highly quaffable and being a 35 beer you can drink a few of them and still be in a condition to do stuff afterwards and thats where and when ill accept xxxx gold as an acceptable beverage because those are the conditions this beer is brewed for you wouldnt go drinking a super thick iipa or a stout in those conditions no and you shouldnt be drinking this in the snowy mountains of nsw in the depths of winter unless you were driving you were being sensible and theres no other lightmid option to me its always tasted like a beer flavoured mineral water
1900,XXXX Gold,2.85,gold in color with with excellent clarity theres a fingernail of eggshell white around the rim and covering all but a sliver of the top light lacing the aroma is of corn and a hint of grassy hops im tasting a bit of diacetyl and some grassy hops at the back of the palate the mouth is watery and thin
1901,XXXX Gold,2.9,best by august 20th 2019 can  looks gold enough to me pretty fluffy head of foam lacing is good  simple nose of corny grain some but not enough of that aussie malt mild touch of hops  no surprises in the taste light flavours it is 35abv of corngrain tiny malt sweetness low presence of hoppy bitterness served cold cuz i reckoned that would put it at its optimum  pretty decent mouthfeel considering  nice to try once
1902,XXXX Gold,3.12,the very definition of a mid beer an australian domestic made for the working class sitting at 35 and 375ml which equals 1 standard drink allowing people to manage their alcohol intake at places where you need to drive out in the bush the beach the pub home after work this beer is extremely popular because it targeted a demographic of people on the move  goes down best with fish and chips from your local or after mowing the lawn on a hot and humid aussie day ice cold 35 means it lacks much punch however it can feel a bit watery as well as lack carbonation from time to time clear bright and orangyyellow one finger of head when poured however due to my fondness of this domestic drop i prefer i straight out of the dark bottle its just an icon of suburban brisbane not a classy beer but a well mapped and demographically targeted beer thats just very average it is popular here for a reason
1903,XXXX Gold,4,the weak little brother of xxxx bitter a welcomed introduction to allow red blooded aussies to consume 2 tins in the first hour and 1 every hour after that and still be able to drive home without the risk of losing your licence for 2 years and having your car crushed under the draconian nanny state eye thanks xxxx ps its actually pretty ordinary but hey any beer on the way home is better than none
1904,XXXX Gold,2.07,draft at nannup hotel and pub tastes and smells like wallpaper paste clear hold n body with weak head bland and not very tasty these pasty lagers sure are popular in the bush
1905,Bravo,4.5,a poured into a snifter to a deep brown beer thats slightly amber around the edges the beer is topped by a dense and slightly rocky finger and a half of off white head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing s smells of caramel and brown sugar with some hints of barrel and faded oily hops t taste is caramel some oak and woodspice hints of citrus and pine from the hops a touch of vanilla and some brown sugar sweetness on the finish theres more oily citrus and pine with some lingering oak caramel and brown sugar m this beer has a body which is on the heavier side of medium carbonation is slightly effervescent and adequate for the style while the beer has a drying finish due to the abv o overall this is a really good beer great flavors and decent complexity that also stands up well to some age
1906,Bravo,4.83,consumed in 2023 quite a revelation in a field of mild brown ales nothing mild here brown liquid with a sturdy beige head oak and bourbon come through in delightful waves but never too much bourbon strength is balanced with a fig and chocolate sweetness creating a beer that evolves throughout the taste leaving a deep luxurious finish work of art here
1907,Bravo,4.63,more barrel aged barley wine than brown ale but regardless of how you classify this beer its is a tasty beer very well done with the barrel aging moderated but strong a beautiful clear amber brown warming smooth and a hint of sweetness
1908,Bravo,4.3,august 2022 poured an opaque brown with a small light brown collar fridge temp  aroma of prunes molasses bread wood bourbon with some alcohol notes  taste of of dark bread prunes chocolate figs fudge vanilla some winey taste in there too definitely evolved as it warmed got better and better or that could be the alcohol talking  mouthfeel was somewhat heavy on the tongue  overall very nice especially given its age held up well over the years the beer reminded me of a warm blanket sitting in front of a fire nice
1909,Bravo,4.25,look relatively clear amber reddish tan head smell bready brown sugar slight hint of bourbon and vanilla taste like the nose super smooth after 4 years
1910,XTRA DUBL Benthic,4.74,2021 vintage opened first within a couple months of release  this is really fantastic but so is regular benthic 2021 specifically and especially when fresh lots of coconut but not in the pastry territory of something like coconut vibes coffee is still present but balanced by the coconut mouthfeel is on point  i tried to rate this for what it is not whether or not i felt a little let down  which i did i had expectations that it would be a little more coconut forward in fact im not sure it is truly that much different than regular benthic but that doesnt make it any less delicious it just didnt quite meet the expectation i set for it
1911,Maximus,3.66,malty and sweet too sweet for me honestly almost reminds me of a hoppy malt liquor little to no alcohol burn goes down easy not my favorite
1912,Maximus,4.03,aroma is a reliable pine and stonefrui flavors a great followup bodys a solid nocomplications bitter pine stonefruit and cantaloupe this is straightforward and strong a good everyday drinker
1913,Maximus,4.03,delicious and noteworthy for how well balanced is as the brewery notes lovely deep golden color with a healthy itinerant head pretty straightforward nose here dominated by hops this also has powerful hop flavors that are craftily balanced with sweet bready malts a little thin on the mouthfeel maybe really really tasty and gets right on top of you thanks to the well masked alcohol notes in the 9percenter
1914,Maximus,5,i am in las vegas bought a 19 oz can for 299 at the abc store very good beer and i really like the sweetness and 9 alcohol will definitely have this again great beer      a
1915,Maximus,3.5,too strong and too bitter for me to drink in one sitting although there is a faint sweetness that i enjoy
1916,Maximus,4.51,great taste mouthfeel and finish a 90 double ipa 12 pack for 20 bucks how could you go wrong best value in beer
1917,Maximus,4.7,ive been trying all the different beers at the walgreens at penn station ny i pick up a few and have them on my commute home on a njtransit train to my home in middletown nj today i decided to give lagunitas maximus a try and i glad i did i tried a few of their beers an i like this one the best it packs a wallop at 900 apv and consider it coats only 2 for 549 its a good value this ipa has a strong taste an is worthy to being called an ipa with its pungent hops and bite this beer type is not for everyone so if you like coors or miller please stay away because its got too much taste for you for what you get its amazing
1918,Maximus,4.15,its like a tripel thats an ipa fruity good alcohol taste good buzzya its a nice maltfruit backbone to the ipa flavors 810
1919,Maximus,3.9,im coming across a bunch of backlog beers that ive had and somehow missed logging years ago while looking at the most popular beers list this is one i remember enjoying a good bit but being a bit sharply bitter
1920,Maximus,3.91,picked up a tallboy can with a date of 030723  pours an amber copper in color with a finger thick head of frothy foam that leaves lacing on the glass as you drink carbonation looks average with small bubbles rising from the bottom theres plenty of hop residue left in the beer from the dry hopping process looks to be pretty balanced  balanced on the nose as well with rich roasted malts and lemon candy hops lots of fruitiness in there though a bit hard to distinguish notes maybe some blood orange and mango as it warms theres a bit of a sweetsour thing going on as well its not overly aromatic surprisingly  definitely hop forward but remains pretty balanced on the tongue roasted malts dominate up front giving way to the fruity citrusy spicy hops towards the swallow but remaining throughout picking up notes of apple pineapple and cherry the finish is surprisingly mild with some roasted malts and pine on the tongue not picking up any alcohol until perhaps the final swallow  mouthfeel is medium bodied with a solid amount of chewiness and subdued carbonation which works quite well the finish is pretty dry it does coat the tongue a bit over time but is surprisingly not much of a palate wrecker dangerously drinkable at 9 abv  havent picked up anything from lagunitas in awhile thought i would give this one a shot it definitely has the profile of a classic double ipa well balanced but also pungently hopped theres a lot of complexity to savor here as well especially as the beer warms but its also quite drinkable im not a huge double ipa fan i have them only occasionally but if the style is part of your rotation this one is sure to please a very solid offering cheers
1921,Maximus,3.65,look pours a slightly orange shade of yellow with a one finger rocky head of off white foam below average lacing moderate head retention  aroma the nose is fruit punch like  with notes of sugary orange pineapple juice and sweet cherry sort of anemic and weak i really have to stick my nose deep down in the glass to get much of anything  taste surprisingly not as sweet as the nose would let on and strangely well balanced for such a strong imperial ipa reminds me of a dole fruit cup upfront im tasting some nice notes of bittersweet toffee and dry caramel midpalate is rounded out by some nice tropical flavors of pineapple juice and tangysweet orange juice theres a brief flash of shredded coconut and sour cherry the finish is bitter and resinous but not overpowering ending with restrained notes of pine sap and a slight spicy garlic note  feel alcohol profile is slightly noticeable mouthfeel is slightly oily and sticky but not sugary dryfruity a touch on the heavy side but not decisively so carbonation level is moderate  overall this is very fruit cocktail like probably the mosaic hops its not exactly my style but i enjoyed it the first time i tried this beer a year or two ago i didnt like it at all and thought it wasnt even worth rating or reviewing after having decided to try it again i was pleasantly surprised how my taste has changed this isnt anything life changing or mind blowing but id recommend it if youve never tried it and are looking for a strong imperial ipa that isnt to that slap you in the face level of hop intensity and bitterness
1922,Carling Black Label,3.39,l beautiful gold body with white pillow top of one inch that sticks around nice s not much nose at all slight alcohol is all i pick up t some corn on the front end and dry hops on the back end not sweet but dry which i admire in an aal f above average for the style smooth easy drinking o far above the average for an aal lager recommended
1923,Carling Black Label,3.21,this is good for an aal it tastes of corn adjunct and water but it goes down smooth its refreshing and cheap when i feel like drinking in session it goes perfect in between hamms or banquet i wish i could get a straight answer on what the abv is
1924,Carling Black Label,4.3,a hot post grass cutting day i drank it out of the can perfect the second one was even better look perfectbecause the can looks cool smell seriously taste in the pabst realm not watery not too sweet what you were expecting the usual corn bread toasted malt bs feel like a cold 12 oz can overall on my way to the garage fridge for a 3rd

1929,Carling Black Label,5,sweet and refreshing probably the only beer in the world that holds its taste at room temperature its very citrusy to my taste buds like five alive  idk why maybe because i find cheese disgusting and absolutely horrible just the smell of cheese alone is enough to make me vomit  i do try different beers from time to time and i always endup going back for black label  old and true √† beers beer never disappointed always consistent flavors

1932,Carling Black Label,3.33,happy canada day hosers take off eh this is one of my favorite holidays of the year since it provides me with the impetus to a drink canned canadian beer iso the canquest tm b watch hockey either prerecorded games or movies like slapshot c watch strange brew d eat some beaver  e parade nekkid in the street while waving a candian flag 2017 was their 150th anniversary so i pulled out all of the stops using sparklers  firecrackers as accoutrements which was attentiongetting to say the least the local canstabulary was bemused  amused as they led me away but i was lessthanthrilled with the 1st  2nd degree burns especially to my sensitive bits needless to say i have scaled back since then  a big thank you to my local inperson trading partner tone77  for providing me with a buncha beers for todays canebration he said that many of them will take me back to the early days of the canquest tm when aals were the standard  the norm no matter today we canebrate  inebriate cheers to our canuck neighbors  this beer really takes me back it was  1969  my latepops was a hardcore unionist working at the nowdefunct alcoa plant a strike was in the offing  so a meeting was held at my parents house to decide a course of action my rents while not teetotalers were not big imbibers so alcohol consumption was kind of a rarity i was  4 yo at the time  curious so when somebody offered me a sip from their can of carling black label pops nodded in assent  i partook for the first time in my life i can only remember being astounded by the bitterness of the hops just before i dropped the can from my hands spilling it all over the carpet uproarious laughter ensued except from pops who promptly escorted me to bed lol  i had o canada playing on youtube as i cracked open the vent to begin this momentous canebration  this reminds me of another story i was a plankowner aboard the uss normandy cg60 in 1989  when we opened the staten island naval shipyard in late1990 i was a fixture at rangers games msg it was easy  flash my active duty id pay a pittance  sit in the infamous blue seats where the action happened beer was a given  if i got there early enough to where they were not sold out a potato knish profanity was the native tongue up there  cocaine was openly snorted but those are tales for another time on this night the tor maple leafs were in town necessitating the singing of both the us  canadian national anthems i know the latter in both english et fran√ßais so i was singing along when i suddenly registered the voices behind me right tune wrong words or so i thought after the anthems were done  we were seated i donned my curious cat suit  turned to ask the guys behind me as to what had transpired they were spanishspeaking latinos of puerto rican descent who had grown up in hells kitchen  were lifelong rangers fans they had been to so many games that they sing the national anthems in spanish i sat back flabbergasted  onward i went with a nice freeflowing glug since this was such an auspicious occansion leading to the foamy formation of twoplus fingers of fizzy foamy rockybonegreat white north head but with only moderate retention 8 color was a pretty yellowgold srm  4  5 with canadianquality clarity  now the gelt gang of midas mammon  croesus appeared to join the canadian canebration whotta party nose was actually not bad when rating to style  the adjunct that mars most if not all aals is the inclusion of corn i have loved fritos corn chips since kindergarten when i first had them as a snack but i do not like the taste of corn in beer it is an extender that traces its roots to illicit beer being made during prohibition when anything  everything was fair game as far as ingredients were cancerned  yes there was a corn aspect to the nose but i have encountered far worse with some like opening a bag of the aforementioned fritos 8p this was on the low end of that fkedup spectrum mouthfeel was medium the taste was more innocuous than anything else it was light in flavor to the point that adjuncts were more of an afterthought than something with which to be cancerned i was kind of surprised at just how flavorless this seemed to me to be my palate as a selfavowed selfdescribed hophead seemed to have evolved to the point that aals are rendered simply ethereal not bad just not destined for guy fieris flavortown finish was crisp dry  refreshing on this hot hazy humid canada day which is just what they were shooting for sure its a flawed beer but the style itself is flawed remember rate to style  not to taste boys  girls
1933,Carling Black Label,3.23,poured from a 16 oz can has a very pale straw color with a 12 inch head smell is of grains light sweetness taste is of malts corn light sweetness feels light bodied in the mouth and overall it aint bad at this price point and would probably be very refreshing most of the time but its a brutally cold february night in ontario
1934,Milwaukee's Best Ice,3,tastes horrible and gives you a rougher hangover than the other ice beers that being said at 10 dollary doos for a 15pk even in todays nightmare world timeline the beast ice is a winner in my book  style ice lager  tapcanbottle can  abv 59  rating 3
1935,Milwaukee's Best Ice,3.75,poured from a 16oz can into a mug pours a fairly clear straw gold with a quicktofade white foam pretty musty on the nose but a little better in the taste its not the most offensive beer ive ever had by bar but its definitely a one and a done mouthfeel is decent  fuller and actually quite smooth been a long time since ive wet my whistle with this one id revisit again on a regular basis the heavy beers like this are just tough more than one and youre just asking for trouble
1936,Milwaukee's Best Ice,2.25,pours out of the can a crystal clear gold with a fizzy head with surprising lacing smells like malt and maybe corn taste follows the nose pretty much its really not bad decent carbonation and goes down pretty smooth cheap beer that doesnt hurt anybody
1937,Milwaukee's Best Ice,5,best lager in stores the cost to buy it has tripled in last several months i cannot afford it anymore my neighbor and i would love to drink more of it we are old and dont drive
1938,Milwaukee's Best Ice,2.84,poured from a 32 oz can best buy february 13th 2023  on the poor a threefinger 3 finger white and very fizzy head was present surprisingly decent retention with retention with it only dissipating to about one finger after a couple minutes the body is a golden a golden color a bit darker than standard aal fine lively carbonation carbonation and it tries to lace  aroma is a bit rough on this one and lots of assetelda hide green apple smell thats just a bit off mixed with a is corny light malt a bit chemically like fusel alcohol like a lot of ice beers are  the acetyl to hide comes through on the taste as well again with the light corning malt and a bit of sweetness although it isnt overwhelming for the most partless beer is pretty drinkable  feels just a bit too big to be a refreshing aal and a bit too syrupy to be a nice bigger lager still for the abv its easy to put down  overall this is just about what i expected from this beer but honestly it exceeded my very low expectations not as bad smelling as a few of the other cheapos ive grabbed and its drinkable if not just a bit syrupy feeling
1939,Milwaukee's Best Ice,2.4,tastes of mothers milk
1940,Milwaukee's Best Ice,3,ill admit msbest may not be the best tasting beer on the planet but it is cheap cold and refreshing after ive mowed the yard it damn well hits the spot and ill sure as heaven take msbest over any ipa or craft beer drink on beer lovers

1942,Milwaukee's Best Ice,1,drainpour
1943,Milwaukee's Best Ice,3.62,for the price its a good flavored best ice with extra kick of alcohol
1944,Milwaukee's Best Ice,3.2,very hot day corner store just wanted some cold beer to take down to the lake store had 3 beers to pick from four 16oz cans of milwaukees best ice for 275 why not took the lawn chair out of the trunk and snapped open a cold one i was surprised this beer was much better than i was expecting especially after all the negative comments ive heard about it prior good alcohol content good taste great price i like this beer ill be keeping it in my shop beer fridge
1945,Sinebrychoff Porter,3.73,im not sure how old this beer is i tried to peel off the sticker to see the bb date but it got erased  its probably past the date  nice pour dark brown color with a 2f head  the aroma is weird unlike any aroma from a beer ive tasted woody caramel not bad but not pleasant  mf is medium smooth  the taste mimics the aroma i cant define it not like the other baltic porters ive tasted which have a more defined porter taste  overall unusual but just okay
1946,Sinebrychoff Porter,4.02,330ml bottle i think the date coding is under a later affixed jahrgang 1816 sticker black colored body with a red mahogany back lit edge two fingers of tan head fizzes away in about a minute no lacing aroma of dark roasted malts caramel a bit of smoke and black licorice taste is dark roasted malts chocolate caramel prune a bit of smoke and black licorice bitterness at the end more than medium mouth feel seems a little chalky and dry especially in the throat quiet carbonation good overall but reminds me of an old flat carbonated cola without the sugarcorn syrup flavors linger only for a short while
1947,Sinebrychoff Porter,3.83,part of a gift drank from the undated bottle dark bakers chocolate smell good mouth feel taste is a bit dry some chocolate and coffee in the rear overall a good beer that just seems to be missing something is it old should i try the other bottle in a glass overall i enjoyed this but would not buy this beer unless i saw it on tap just to try that version  i decided to pull the gold foil sticker off the bottom of the bottle surprise best by 13 november 2020 fuck you shangys there are other reasons i wont buy beer from your shop and this is just another how many other old beers are you putting stickers over dates the sticker looked like it belonged till i really looked at it
1948,Sinebrychoff Porter,4.43,an excellent porter nice roasted malt earthy wet skree best way for me to describe the earthiness dark bitter coffee a bit dry with a medium mouthfeel the way it should be
1949,Sinebrychoff Porter,3.75,not sure about this one there is a good maltiness to it with medium carbonation but significant bitterness followed by a smokeburned taste it is not a bad taste just not sure this all works together feels like it does not blend together kinda of clashes i think maybe i just didnt have a lot of porter lately
1950,Sinebrychoff Porter,4.64,one of the finest porters i think ive ever tasted but that could have been just my mindset at the time in any case its very good pours near black with a short 12 head that dissipates to a trace the aroma is wonderful i got loads of malts with notes of caramel and a whiff of maybe smoked barley the taste follows the aroma and it too is wonderful in addition to the caramel i sense licorice and that smoke essence the feel is more than i expected just that good this is definitely one i would be happy to have in the cellar on a regular basis i sipped it slowly so as to savor the experience so good
1951,Sinebrychoff Porter,4.41,pours dark brown almost no head chocolate aroma and burnt caramel taste with a slightly hoppy burnt toast aftertast a very satisfying porter
1952,Sinebrychoff Porter,3.95,pours a lovely dark brown almost black color completely opaque and rather thick in appearance pillowy 34 finger mocha colored head dissipates slowly leaving a thin layer of bubbly foam on top of the beer lots of stick lacing is left behind on the glass  aroma has notes of roasted malts some dark fruits licorice and dry cocoa there is a slight smoky aroma more reminiscent of smoked bbq as someone described it more that it is just straight up smoked malts like in a rauchbier finally you do get some of that lager yeast coming through on the nose  taste follows the nose you get some roasted malts cocoa dark fruit and licorice with a smoky finish very earthy herbal hops provide some bittering on the back end light smokiness comes through as the beer warms up with a definite smoked bbq like quality  feel is light to medium bodied with a certain dry chalkiness to it moderate carbonation prickles the tongue that dryness to the beer carries into the finish  overall this is a really nice baltic porter
1953,Sinebrychoff Porter,4.39,330ml bottle impossible to decipher best before as the stamp overlaps the text  black with a red tint at the edges dense tawny head of decent height leaving medium lace  nose is enticing fudge mixed with licorice in the centre roasted even some pleasantly burned aromas hot chocolate just a hint of red berries  long aftertaste of bitterness mixing hops and dark chocolate tart roasted bite at the front on the other hand and in the middle both blend harmoniously  still a uniquely smooth example within the style hard to break into parts as the elements blend so well
1954,Sinebrychoff Porter,4.34,from old undated notes poured from the bottle  pitch black no ruby around the edges  small dark khaki head which quickly dissipates almost no lacing  nose is of smoked barbecue with a rich sweetness pork ribs slathered in bbq sauce comes to mind subtle black licorice as well  thin mouthfeel dangerously drinkable for such a dark porter  slight metallic flavor on first sip gives way to malted chocolate flavor as the beer progresses the metallic taste which all baltic porters have to me goes away and reveals a roasted character by far the best bp ive ever had complex  enigmatic would definitely buy again and have
1955,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Gr√∏n),5,tuborg green is another delicious beer that i love to have with my spicy food it has the right malty taste and it is perfectly refreshing anytime and anywhere it is a musthave beer in the fridge according to my opinion and when you have it have something spicy it blends in perfect we need tuborg all over the world it simply a wonderful beer i like its aftertaste it has that crispytingly feel to the tongue which is interesting and addictive
1956,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Gr√∏n),2.77,a standard danish pilsener for many years golden colour white head sweetish aroma and flavour of malts very moderate herbal hops in the finish in norway tuborg is ringnescarlsbergs cheapest brand so the ringnesbrewed version feels even thinner than the danish original
1957,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Gr√∏n),3.45,doesnt feel anything specialtastes better than it feelsgoes down very easilyits on the thinner side but not too thinand its refreshing
1958,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Gr√∏n),2.57,had it at a restaurant looked funky didnt recognize the name  pours a straw yellow colour with small head that leaves no lacing smells of lightly bready malt and literally nothing else tastes of malt and not a whole lot else tastes like the copy paste lager mouthfeel is light with mediumhigh carbonation  overall this doesnt have that pilsner pop that youd hope for but its also a lot better than the american industrial lagers so im not going to bash it at all not sure what i expected when i got it since the beer selection was very industrialuninspired should have went with wine i suppose
1959,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Gr√∏n),3.05,i had this beer while on vacation in rome poured from a 169 oz can has as golden color with a 12 inch head smell is mild some malts taste is of malts some green apples creeping in at the finish feels mediumlight bodied in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer
1960,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Gr√∏n),3.75,on tap white head with lace clear golden color  classic euro pils crisp clean refreshing earthy grassy hops biscuity malts  light bodied easy drinking nice on a hot summer day
1961,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Gr√∏n),3.22,from the can it pours a very nice amber color with a nice white head in the nose it is grain more than anything in the mouth it is a pleasant bit of malt and some bitterness acceptable great after a hot day in dc
1962,Enjoy By IPA,4.1,ive had 12 other enjoy by date beers  they all were rated a 4  one a 45 all were 94  this is a hazy ipa pours a yellow haze with nice hop sell a great beer to grab a couple six packs just had their 103122 an it was amother great ipa smooth citrus and hoppy
1963,Enjoy By IPA,4.6,stone enjoy by 42022 hazy ipa 9 smell is a bit dank  tropical with a little alcohol i can taste a hint of alcohol followed by the tropical sweetness and nice hop flavor on the back end that lingers this is another winner by stone brewing
1964,Enjoy By IPA,4.53,appearance translucent pastel gold proffers up two fingers of finely minced froth thats white as an untouched snowcap modest retention gives way to sudsy webbed lacing  bouquet a mango pineapple peach smoothie rife with tangy citra and bright tangerinesweet amarillo woven together with slender strands of earthy mosaic  feel fullbodied and thick with hop oils the texture is given a much needed third dimension by a boisterous peach fuzz carbonation  taste a huge chomp of justripe yellow mango topped with shreds of candied orange peel then lemony citra and the tropic sweetness of amarillo rise like flowers from the distinct new earth flavor of mosaic hops concludes on a long low afterburn of hop bitters and sauvignon blanc
1965,Sofie,4.51,slightly hazy gold big white head that recedes quickly slippery lace citrus herbal peppery and soft malt aroma tastes like it smells with a bit of vanilla citrus impact is great its more orange than orange without tasting fake light bodied with excellent carbonation really great
1966,Sofie,3.41,at the ohare airport on the way to boston  looks great yellow slight haze smells like a belgian but with a fruity edge tastes much better when poured out i dont really taste the orange peel but lots of coriander and belgian yeast flavor a lemon tang and silky smooth yeasty goodness still not a fan of goose islands belgian stuff  babys first belgian
1967,Sofie,4.07,on tap at the clybourne brewpub  next stop goose island continuing on with my chicago beer escapade i just had to stop at this legendary brewery for some good beers here and to go lets see what their classic saision is all about  pours a cloudy yellow gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  theres not much funk or tartness to the nose as i tend to prefer in the style but the earthy vibe is still quite nice im picking up on aromas of white pepper lemon zest white tea crackery malt tannic white wine wildflower honey pear skin and earthy wheat  likewise in taste it is more just straight earth than funk and again still good on the front end of the sip im tasting lemon zest crackery malt wildflower honey white tea peppery hops apple skin and light toast the swallow brings notes of clove bready malt white grape honey peppery hops pear skin and a touch of vanilla  a light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a crisp and sharp beer finishes mostly dry and refreshing  this is a nice well rounded saison nothing to seek out but good nonetheless
1968,Sofie,3.98,fairly light with a touch of funkiness and bitterness more bitter than i expected but that may also be the citrus peel excellent aroma
1969,Sofie,4.02,this is a 12oz bottle poured into the goose island pint glass this brew is slightly hazy a light yellow with a slight orange tint when held up to the light there is an abundant amount of carbonation to watch parade to the top the half inch of fluffy white head did recede to a thin cap after several minutes the aroma is quite noticeable from a distance for starters there is a sweet fruity citrus i am leaning toward notes of orange there is a pleasant yeast and wheat mixture happening also the wheat is the first thing i am picking up a little yeast then the orange peel the finish is slightly bitter a tad dry with a bump of pepper spice this is an easy drinker not heavy a medium smooth feel
1970,Sofie,4.14,pours a bronzish gold minimal lacing slightly funky scent with orange background slightly funky slightly tart mildly citrus lighter body especially for a barrel aged beer good but light
1971,Sofie,3.12,a saison found the day after saison day better late but unfortunately this was the only one available two brown twelve ounce bottles have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug its a light amber liquid really not much different in color than most lagers there is a bit more opaqueness than lagers generally have a nice modest and enduring white head is included the glass lacing is even less the smell is vaguely yeasty and perhaps a little perfumellke the taste is yeasty and perfumellke but mildly refreshing it certainly is much lighter in feeling and taste than an ipa not everyone will appreciate that as a good thing orange peel is included in the mix its there but not a heavy influence on the taste probably it adds to a dry bitterness that shows at the finish that part is well done for without it this could be a yeasty mess theres no evidence this has an abv above five percent other than to read it on the label probably average for the style this isnt going to convert a hop loving dipa devotee yet for a once a year change it wasnt such a terrible thing
1972,Sofie,4.65,good tasting saison great flavor
1973,Hop 15,4.03,slightly hazy orange amber look has the classic west coast dipa basics citric and piney smell with taste of the malt sweetness piney resinous and grapefruit flavors linger thicker and sweeter feel and taste than i would like minimal carbonation and not overpowering bitterness im a pizza port fan from sd this is a beer to pair with dinner or lunch but at 11 abv youre better off doing it closer to bedtime
1974,Hop 15,3.94,september 19th 2015  ports 15 double hop is a no frills no thrills double ipa clean and consistent this is like the sierra nevada pale ale of dipas and i love it the color is a nice orange marmalade shade with a generic ipa smell and its not even especially hoppy but the flavor is where that brilliant familiarity lies balanced good hops and a clean taste balanced on a comfortable body this is a great beer to pair with food
1975,Hop 15,4.05,from the large can it pours a clear amber with a modest head but leaves lacing as you enjoy it in the nose it is solidly hops in the mouth the same it is a classic west coast ipa
1976,Hop 15,4.17,poured on draft  pours a lightly hazy golden amber color with a finger of creamy white head the head leaves some cobwebs of lacing before settling into a ghostly thin sheet  the aroma brings loads of pineapple and grapefruit as well as some orange and honeydew melon the pine cones through in the back  the flavor brings grapefruit pineapple and caramel malts followed by a bitter piney finish classic west coast right here  the feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation smooth yet a touch syrupy and sticky alcohol is definitely present  overall a great dipa that punches you in the dick with hops yet has plenty of sweet malt for balance would drink again
1977,Hop 15,4.31,192 oz can from winooski beverage vermont stamped on the bottom freshest by 12172019 this was poured into a tulip the appearance was a ruddy burnt amber bronze color with a level foamy white head slowly dissipating to leave some wispy messy lace the aroma seemed to lead with a blend that reminded me of honeydew coated biscuits some light dry citrus rind underneath with an ever so slight whiff of clean laundry some floral hops lean in further underneath the flavor dryly took the sweetness and met it with an ample bitterness mellow aftertaste of biscuit malts floral hops and some honeydew the mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fair sipping quality about it the abv might be high in this one but it seems like the brewer was able to combine well enough to not let the abv overtake in any sort of way some smoothness running along my tongue carbonation felt good like a west coast styled dipa finishes with some malty sweetness but slightly sticky and dry floral hop bitterness overall not sure why people cant distinguish between west coast styled dipas and new england styled ones but those of out there loving on a great west coast styled dipa you should seek this out
1978,Hop 15,4.27,yikes 192 oz can 110 abv freshest by 121720 moderate to vigorous pour yields a 34 inch creamy white head over a fairly bright golden body with sticky lacing nose of citrus pine sap and slight damp bud taste mirrors nose with a malt character and pine bitterness throughout bitterness is not too much but it is surely up front and personal nice feel and overall abv is not too well hidden and i wont be driving anywhere tonight hey pick one up lose your car keys and you wont be disappointed cheers
1979,Hop 15,4.59,bright yellow gold mostly filtered with little carbonation topped with 3 fingers of white head  smells of dope green leaf fresh hop cones pineapple and citrus candy  tastes of dope green leaf hop cones pineapple and tropical jello  medium syrupy body with little carbonation  i got this in redding where i am enjoying it july 19th 2019 excellent brew
1980,Blended With Lumber #1,4.25,pours a dark brown color with a minimal head that disappears quickly sweet aroma of vanilla and roasted malts taste is vanilla and caramel with a strong alcohol warmth thick and creamy
1981,Blended With Lumber #1,4.24,a  dark brown pour with dense toffee colored lacing  s  toasted roasted cocoa with some booziness  t  toasted cocoa oak bourbon and ends on the sweeter side  m  big silky body  o  really impressive and want more
1982,DDDoublegangerrr,4.51,this one pours a very hazy golden orange color with a small head and lots of lacing  this smells super tropical with nectarine mango pineapple lime and peach  this is a creamy treat for sure with a dense and juicy hop character and just a hint of bitterness on the back end its got such a full and vibrant flavor to it  its a nice step up from an already great ipa  this is creamy thick and super drinkable with a smooth finish  this is an absolute delight i have just been having really great luck with tree house ipas lately
1983,DDDoublegangerrr,4.63,l  creamy opaque golden orange with a fluffy white head that sticks around a little bit leaving behind a good amount of lacing s fresh piney bitter hops followed by sweet tropical fruits and citrus t  follows the nose  fresh piney bitter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with tropical fruits  pineapple orange grapefruit  with some malt on the backend f  medium leaning towards full bodied with moderate carbonation smooth o  very similar to most tree house neipas ive had truly fantastic but just ever so slightly more hoppy
1984,DDDoublegangerrr,4.63,excellent head production retention and lacing beautiful beer in the style  very slight herbal edge to the aroma but not nearly so dank as amarillo and mosaic can trend juicy notes are a decent balance of tropical and citrus fruit with perhaps a slight edge to the latter  flavor follows as its a creamy juicy fruity iipa that carries a slight herbal edge to round out the profile tasting notes of melon pineapple papaya mandarin orange nectarine lemon lime while the nose is fairly balanced between the main fruity notes the palate certainly leans more tropical  creamy with a light liveliness and slight bite fantastic and full bodied
1985,DDDoublegangerrr,4.81,look  fantastic thick hazy honey orange with a thick white milky tad yellow head that last and sticky smell  oh my tropical citrus stone fruit galore taste  basically the same as the smell sweet but not overly sweet slight boozy feel  medium full body with a medium light slight fizz carb and a slight creamy overall  really fantastic
1986,DDDoublegangerrr,4.49,appearance pours cloudy and the color of peach nectar the three finger head rises and sticks leaving webs of lacing all over  smell peach pineapple and mango with a hint of tangerine  taste peach and mango forward with some pineapple sweetness emerging through the middle the tangerine adds a citrus dimension moderate bitterness joins with a juicy finish maybe just a bit green in the aftertaste  mouthfeel medium to full bodied and somewhat creamy moderate carbonation  overall after a disappointing experience with very green tree house is back on track with this beer
1987,DDDoublegangerrr,4.66,looks like most treehouse double ipas  a mixture of orange and pineapple juice i have a slight preference for the alter egodoppelganger family over its sister julius family and that holds true for this  the so far top dog in the family it delivers an intense burst of citrus and other fruit wrapped in a creamy mouthfeel but i do think it could use a touch more bitterness at the end  theres less than i remember in the lower abv variants interestingly the aftertaste has quite a bit of bitter orange peel so the bitterness is there  its just masked by the fruit none of that takes anything away from a lovely beer but its definitely one to take your time over
1988,DDDoublegangerrr,4.74,mango pineapple stone fruit and ripe oranges on the nose palate contrasts with slightly earthier tones more pronounced bitterness and a spicy floral finish a heavy hitter but always something i loved about doubleganger and its variations
1989,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,3.98,on tap at monks cafe strong dark ale is right
1990,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,4.25,bottle purchased at fattey beer co in rochester ny 2022 vintage best before 2025  this one pours a dark golden brown color with a small head and a little lacing  this smells like spiced bread dried plums and raisins molasses and herbal hops  this is a pretty standard but very well done belgian dark strong ale theres not too much in the way of spicing  light clove and a general warming spice character along with a malt note thats reminiscent of molasses and baked bread theres just a touch of slightly bitter hop character  this is medium bodied creamy and with no real booziness to it  this feels pretty classic and i enjoyed it a lot
1991,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,3.59,purchased at vintage cellar in blacksburg va drank in my hotel room so had to pour it into a small clear plastic solo cup bottle info best before 8625 t9 1320 cant believe ive never had this beer  this beer may label itself as a christmas ale but dont let your dislike of xmas ales keep you from trying this one the xmaswinter ale spice is very low this is a nice but not exceptional belgian dark ale complex but not what i would call a rich tasting beer too much bitterness for the style in my opinion 35  a  pours clear dark amber with a huge tannish mousey head opaque in the glass excellent lacing some of the best i have ever seen 45  s  generally lacking an aroma what is present is malty with faint xmas spices of clove and nutmeg no sweetness pepperiness or dried fruit 30  t  malty slightly spicey brown bread no sweetness some minor dried fruit some vinous red wine like astringency and an herbal bitterness in the finish alcohol is not evident 375  mf  medium heavy body with a surprisingly dry finish not particularly smooth slick or coating slightly thin for the style carbonation is good with some sharpness on the tongue 40
1992,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,4.83,smells of jammy dark breads with some spice poured a long lasting thin off white head taste is amazing complex too hard to describe great beer highly recommend

2001,Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,4.9,170 yum
2002,Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,5,first of all the smell i could sit all day with the glass to my nose and just smell this all day thick mouthfeel very very tasty just a great dessert stout
2003,Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,4.56,2022 version poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter nice thickness dominant peanut aroma solid blend of chocolate peanut and marshmallow flavor
2004,Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,4.38,not much peanut butter perhaps due to barrel
2005,Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,4.17,i kinda wish there was more toasted coconut and less young coconut in this bad boy
2006,Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,4.73,look  outstanding black thick with a really nice than frothy sticky head smell  so much coconut and chocolate taste  sweet coconut and chocolate along with a ton of barrel feel  thick and creamy overall  if you like coconut this is the best there is
2007,Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,5,thick gooey delicious just tastes magnificent great smell amazing body coats the mouth perfectly one of the best ive ever had nice and dark not boozy super sweet
2008,Corona Extra,2.33,gets a 5 for look in the bottle or a 125 out of the bottle its an amazing design and the font is unbelievable this time i drink out of the bottle so it gets a 5  rereviewing after just drinking a corona premier to compare that is probably the worst beer i have ever had i do like the bottle design and the stegosauruses however i am reviewing the beer not the artwork  rather a pale colour similar to most beers from mexico aroma is almost nothing with a little lime and there is no lime or lemon added   the aroma is a little better than the premier version  taste is so light im completely confused as to why there is also a light version and a premier version that are even lighter hops are mega subtle but they work well with the lightness this is much better than the premier version in hot weather i guess this is kind of good and refreshing  mouth feel is ok the hops kind of hit you after the initial wateryness the mouth feel is the best thing about this and it was the worst thing about the premier version  overall this isnt as bad without lime as i was expecting its much much better than the premier beer advocate reviewing seriously need to wake up as this actually has a much lower score  as a light beer this is actually ok im just confused why they decided to create even lighter beers i feel like if they created another one i would hover maybe if i go to mexico and live in temperatures each day of 40 centigrade and sweat about mafia murdering me because of giving bad reviews to corona premier i would also like corona premier maybe  
2009,Corona Extra,2,this beer reminds me of every dads refrigerator in the early 2000s it seemed like whenever id go over to a buddys house this was the beer in their dads fridge so i think of that more than i do the cheesy beach commercials i believe i had a corona extra at a bar over fifteen years ago so this was pretty much like a first impression today corona extra has the skunkiness of a heineken without any of the heineken goodness it tastes bitter and not in a fun beer kind of way i added lime to it and now i totally understand why thats a thing but on its own i give it a very generous 2 out of 5  style mexican lager  tapcanbottle bottle  abv 46  rating 2
2010,Corona Extra,2.48,corona is one of those beers most folks have tried at least once in their lifetime its readily available throughout the united states and abroad it is nothing to write home about either its smell is near non existent when cold and as it warms up to a room temperature it has a mild skunk smell its taste is bland when ice cold when warm that skunky and almost metallic like taste comes through hard the feel is well there is none you can easily drink these beers down when ice cold its a decent ish beer when mowing the lawn or doing work outside on a hot summer day but so are many other brands at less cost
2011,Double Jack,4,big bold up front aroma and taste but goes down easy amber color with nice creamy head hoppy smell and slick mouthfeel this is how a double ipa should taste
2012,Double Jack,3.75,yellowish color herbal aromas and flavor notes otherwise a fairly average ipa im not sure i understand the high marks this beer gets
2013,Double Jack,3.69, 072721  can to sniftet  clear  lots of pine smooth and a touch sweet biscuit malt  
2014,Double Jack,4.09,pours a very light hazy amber ample carbonation and a short lived head a 12 ounce can dated 91120 so over six months old first time to find it locally so i bought it it has grapefruit aroma and not particularly strong taste is all hops mostly grapefruit and pine definitely of the west coast variety i imagine it much crisper if it were fresh i get some resin in the tongue a hint of sweetness in there too overall i think age took its toll but still tastes good and id like to give it another chance when i can get it fresh
2015,Double Jack,4.24,aorangegold minimal head as expected with the high abv ssmells like a a west coast double ttastes as advertised too relatively maltforward but never overly so the grapefruit and pine stay up front where they belong above average bitter mslightly above avg carbonation medium body oone of the better wc dipas ive enjoyed despite the six month age fresh this thing would be killer
2016,Double Jack,3,bought a variety 12pack 1598 foodland 85 days old smell of citrus and pine light amber color medium mouthfeel medium carbonation taste of alcohol dominates with some citrus and bitterness flavors overall not that great i think high abv beers that hide their alcohol well are good so this isnt it very unbalanced would not buy again
2017,Double Trouble,3.68,355 ml bottle courtesy of cardinal pub  bar stavanger abv is 94 86 ibus surprisingly pale golden colour probably the palest american double ipa ive seen big to moderate white head distinct but still relatively moderate aroma of citrussy and piney american hops also notes of caramel and orange marmalade the flavour is of course very hoppy from start to finish but not really extreme the grapefruity bitterness is partly balanced by a pronounced malty sweetness notes of caramel and orange marmalade again very bitter aftertaste
2018,Double Trouble,4.74,my favorite ipa big grapefruit up front alcohol is well hidden a great citrusy beer
2019,Double Trouble,4.12,hazed ambergold appearance with a medium size head and decent lacing subtle aroma coaxed out some tropical fruit that resembled mango hoppy flavor leaned more resinous than citrus and was well balanced by the modestly sweet malty backbone lush aftertaste
2020,Double Trouble,4,12 oz bottle pours a glowing ambercopper color nice thick head leaves a nice sticky lacing in my glass strong grapefruit cotton candy aroma full bodied but carbonated  strong citrus flavors nice lasting bitterness very tasty
2021,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,4.15,this beer is sold for 3 at most 711s i think for a craft beer at 711 this is amazing for a rating as a real beer its also solid i think the 88 rating beer advocate has given it is just about accurate
2022,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,3,new belgiums juicy haze ipa is self described as an ipa brewed with spice im not quite sure what that means as it looks to be a hazy straw color with a white head and a fruity aromatic nose theres a flavor thats trying to be sweet and gets about halfway before a gritty flavortexture takes over its not terrible but i expected more from a self described juicy ipa especially when they make some other juicier beers
2023,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,3.83,poured from a 192 oz can with a best before date of 100123 into a shaker pint glass l  poured a hazy orange color with a fluffy white head s  smells of citrus t  tastes matches the smell citrusy with bitterness on the lighter side f  soft feel with a medium body and carbonation o  pretty easy drinking ipa for a 75  ipa
2024,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,5,i tried this beer one afternoon and absolutely loved it light slight tinge of fruit taste did not bloat my stomach alcohol level is perfect great job
2025,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,4.17,very smooth tasting yummy
2026,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,4,i dont tend to like the new belgium beers because they are a little too piney for me but this one was alright maybe because i enjoyed it with some salty snacks
2027,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,3.85,this is yet another hazy ipa  nothing stands out about it its perfectly drinkable and i liked it fine but theres not a lot to say here because its just like every other hazy out there it is a touch higher abv than most checking in at 75 so be aware of that but i didnt really get the fullness of flavor that usually comes with an abv at that point
2028,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,3.75,12 ounce can straight up from the local gas station for 199 pops up and settles back down tastes like every other common hazy ipa its not bad its not remarkable knocks down the beer thirst on this scorching south florida july afternoon and just one will do
2029,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,3.68,voodoo ranger juicy haze ipa bright and citrusy light notes of chocolate little to none of the 75 abv on the back end a good beer will cover a high abv profile wether you have to let it warm a little or not this is one of those cheers
2030,Julius,4.44,poured from a can into a teku glass appearance  the beer pours a very hazy orange color with a big puffy head of offwhite foam the head has a great level of retention fading very slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass smell the aroma is big of a musty grainy and bready smell mixed with lots of raw hop aromas of a herbal and earthy nature there are other citrus aromas of orange and tangerine as well as hints of grapefruit mixed within notes of apricot and some grass are in there as well giving a rather raw and sorta green smell to the brew overall taste  the taste starts out drier than one would anticipate from the nose it begins with a mix of bready and cracker malt flavors combined with hop flavors of a very potent herbal and grapefruit hop notes of a floral and pine hop flavor are there as well but these tastes are light in comparison to the herbal hop all the hop flavors are rather raw in nature having an almost hop pellet like flavor associated with them these potent flavors are the dominant ones throughout much of the taste while said there is a decent showing of fruit flavors of tangerine peach and apricot as well as a hint of mango the mix of sweet bready and hop take the taste to its end where it leaves one with a rather green hopped and slightly fruity and malty taste to linger on the tongue mouthfeel  the body is a bit more on the creamy and chewy side with a carbonation level that is on the more moderate side for the rich hop and malt flavors the feel is well done and makes for a nice easy sipper overall  a very nice brew overall i think i like this better than the king julius as it is more approachable from my standpoint but hits all the same high notes as the king variety big and flavor and drinkability with a nice blend of hop malt and fruit
2031,Julius,4.89,its in the top 250 for a reason top tier
2032,Julius,5,favorite beer between this and king julius and all the other julius versions
2033,Julius,4.35,a smidge more than a fingers worth of rich fluffy light khaki colored froth rock solid retention color is a moderately hazed medium to dark tangerine lovely nose of pineapple mango and assorted citrus some light wheat notes linger beneath the surface hop presence is more floral and less citrus and reminds me of whole cone fresh hops some lemon zest notes as well feel is light to medium bodied and a touch thin carbonation is minimal highly quaffable enjoyable and highly recommended but much more muted than i would have expected given the lofty reputation
2034,Julius,4.57,smell is all ripe mango with a faint hint of peach pour is a dark orange and totally opaque with a small head that dissappates fairly quickly the taste is bitter upfront with sharp carbonation followed hard by mango and then a peachy aftertaste a really good beer for sure bit it may benefit from sitting for a week on the shelf to mellow the upfront astringency some this one was purchased from the brewery yesterday
2035,Julius,4.55,the beer that made treehouse bright orange haze nice balance between sweet and bitter reminiscent of orange zest mouthfeel thats pleasantly tonguecoating but not cloyingly creamy
2036,Julius,4.8,look  orange juice hazy fluffy white head scattered lacing left smell  peach melon citrus taste  peach melon citrus pith hoppy feel  medium body well carbonated citrus pith hoppy finish overall  a wonderfully crafted brew coming in at 68 that is the epitome of a hazy juicy ne ipa right from the start with a juicy hazy look and strong scent of tropical fruit it just feels like its gonna be great then you hit the first sip and yes it is julius lives up to the hype i loved the citrus pith hoppy finish get a hold of julius if you can and pair up with sweet emotion by aerosmith enjoy
2037,Julius,4.78,4 pack picked up at the sandwich location deep orange appearance with a solid couple inches of head taste is very fruity and still balanced with some malty background good balance between sweet and bitter orange and orange peel some nectarine mouthfeel is medium not heavy
2038,Julius,3.71,ths neipas ar top tier and found this flagship to be their beast juicy with that classic hazy flavor maybe more citrus hint than expected but still very good go to the brewery in sturbridge if u get a chance quite a venue btw  go early
2039,Julius,4.51,pours a very hazed honey color with a finger of cream colored head nice lacing  pretty good head retention  s plenty of orange some peaches strawberries  t plenty of orange some green melon peaches dryness  lime up front a little lemongrass  a touch of juicy acidity tangerine lime dryness  kiwi fruit s this beer warms up just a little bit of grassyness  peach too finishes with pomelo green melon lime  dryness plus a kiss of vanilla  pineapple  mf medium body creamy carbonation great balance  very citrussy  juicy maybe not quite as i imagined it to be but still a big hell yeah on this has all the juice
2040,Julius,4.43,canned 4323  poured at about 40 into a weizen glass  first impression of all the categories put together was a flat out wow  pours pure gorgeous juice with a nice off white pillowy head 425  mango and peach forward aroma with some nice hoppy herbals 425  bright tropical juicy sweetness and low bitterness full hop backbone this seriously blew me away and i enjoy ipas but i love this 45  very soft body with low carbo almost a touch of juicy puckering but the aftertaste was sublime 45  overall to date the best ipa ive ever had and i dont think my words have done it justice so a solid 45 will have to do
2041,Cappuccino Stout,3.53,dark rubyblack color roasted caramel and coffee aroma coffee plumcaramel flavor creamy smooth and full mouthfeel nice tan clingy head leaves a nice lacing in my glass nice stout
2042,Cappuccino Stout,3.86,black in color with minimal light penetration theres a half inch of creamy brown on top the aroma is of cappuccino and dark chocolate im tasting cappuccino and dark chocolate the mouth is oily viscous and dry
2043,Cappuccino Stout,3.84,pours a solid black body with a fluffy white head smell is coffee a little chocolate and malt taste is coffee milk chocolate malt touch of hop bitterness and a little sugar medium body pretty close to a cup of cappuccino actually overall for the price this is pretty darned good not my favorite but price wise you could consume this more regularly so a winner
2044,Budweiser,3,a heavily consumed beer from my youth that i havent retried in years unlike most of beer advocate i actually love american adjunct lagers so dont think im one of those fedora tipping antilager guys but it really didnt do anything for me extremely watery tasting id much rather just have a coors miller or buds brother busch i do love the red can though very iconic  style american lager  tapcanbottle can  abv 5  rating 3
2045,Budweiser,1.7,remember drinking many years ago  thought id try and rate it  from notes pours highly carbonated very light yellow the smell is grassy malt and chemical the taste was grassy bitter in a bad wayrough  the alcohol was clearly present and cutting through everything the only flavour that could compete being the chemical one the mouthfeel was watery  nest to no body  overall way too fizzy  basically a soda in that respect it feels carbonated rather than brewed the chemical is there thought and i found that really unpleasant the bitter after taste was acrid  not for me 
2046,Budweiser,3.13,placeholder for my 1000th review  hopefully ill return to edit this with fun and whimsical words i need to get other reviews in first tho  not a great aal but i drank a ton of it in my youth  and i long ago promised a friend that if i ever reviewed 1k beers that id save bud for the occasion
2047,Budweiser,2.55,presentation 12 ounce poured into pint glass  look pale golden color decent head pretty ordinary looking beer  smell strong roasted malt and grain aroma faint hops aroma  taste very malty and grainy flavor the taste is more distinct than i would have thought slight note of hops in the aftertaste  feel mouthfeel is smooth but not watery  overall this beer is okay nothing to write home about but still drinkable other mass produced domestic beers are better
2048,Budweiser,3,even with all the drama not a bad beer
2049,Budweiser,3.06,i will attempt to cut through the hype and grade on a curve for the style drank from a can dated 23dec23 today is july 7th 2023  this is a pretty unremarkable beer any special malt characteristics are blended out the grains being blended with 30 rice in the mash there is a mild hop bitterness on the taste pretty indistinct on the smell what smell there is is dominated by the beechwood chips added during the brewing that part of the brew is unique and underappreciated heavy carbonation which is probably good in something so mild  there is nothing awful about this brew  no offflavors nothing intensely artificial no industrial alcohol vibe bland and light but not so much as bud light which takes better to warming make sure you drink these ice cold
2050,Budweiser,1,people pound a can after yard work because water doesnt offer enough tastethat is its winning quality so many other choices without an aftertaste like the glass wasnt fully rinsed after being washed i never had a good pour of this in a frosted mug or straight from the can read other reviews quantifying why it is a 1 across the board use this beer as the benchmark of what is 1 star and enjoy something better
2051,Budweiser,3,wait for a ridiculously hot day put it in the freezer go outside and do some work get sweaty come in pound the budweiser this is where this beer shines other than that grab some hamms pbr high life etc they are a much better deal and have more satisfaction but hey i got a case for 3 bucks after the rebate
2052,Budweiser,5,the beer of america
2053,Budweiser,3.76,can dated 25jun23 bought an pack due to the large rebate deal they are running cant recall if ive ever had a bud but if so it was decades ago  pours a straw gold with a rapidly dissipating white head very slight bread malt aroma that is then overtaken by toasted rice there isnt a lot of flavor but what is there is pretty good barelytoasted bread white cracker and a slight hop bitterness all the flavors are clean and distinct without muddling or off flavors light bodied with a dry finish  rated to style this is a good beer i dont drink aals often but this is superior to those i have had
2054,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,3.78,this is a nice enough american take on a belgian quad but fails to bring the depth and profundity of the great classics of the style all the basics are there but youre left wanting a little more richness of flavor more lingering booziness in the finish fullness and creaminess rounding out the carbonation solid but a little unremarkable and a quad should if nothing else be remarkable big boulevard booster here but this isnt the one in their portfolio id return to very often
2055,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,3.77,poured from a brown 12 oz bottle has a dark brown color with a 12 inch head smell is of cherries raisins taste is cherries malts and alcohol feels mediumfull bodied in the mouth and overall this is a solid beer
2056,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,4.14,appearance pours a slightly clear 40 clarity medium to dusky bronze color with a massive tan head that overfills the glass 425  aroma strong aromas of rich bread orange citrus belgian spices of some cloves and floral notes then smooth caramel off the back end 400  flavor strong and rich flavors upfront of rich bready malts with some belgian cloves and floral components rich then it follows with some orange citrus sweetness and yeasty notes off the end to dry it off a bit 425  feel heavierbodied stronger carbonation though yeasty bready soft smooth and somewhat dry from the yeast 425  overall a really nice and drinkable belgian quad here rich bready with authentic belgian spices some orange citrus sweetness but ultimately a very bready and yeasty body that dries the body and it drinks deceptively clean for 102 spot on belgian flavors and a great quad here rating 419
2057,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,3.88,tried it in the past and thought i really liked it then went back to it this weekend and it seemed to have a grapefruit tang or some other strong citrus flavor to it which i didnt really enjoy
2058,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,4.01,12oz bottle best by march 27th 2024  on an average pour a massive 4 finger off white to tan head formed dissipated to 3 fingers after a couple minutes streams of fine carbonation come out of a very hazy dark amber body after trying to get the rest into my glass the 4 fingers of head immediately came back sticky but sparse lacing forms  aroma is slightly boozy with a nice belgian yeast character that brings some sweet spicy and lightly fruity notes a caramel sweetness and light nuttiness is present from the dark malts comes off as a big beer but not a 10 beer  the taste is very close to the smell with some added hop bitterness less fruity esters but the spicy belgian character mixes with an alcohol flavor making this pretty intense on the spectrum of non barrel aged beers despite the initial intensity once the bitterness and alcohol dies down after a few seconds a malty smooth nuttiness and caramel sweetness round everything out  the feel full bodied with a definite maltiness but this beer is highly attenuated and not as thick as doppelbocks the alcohol isnt felt at first but as you drink more a slight warming sensation begins within the body long but smooth finish a very nice armchaircelebration beer  overall this was a pretty nice beer also a very good candidate for cellaring i held onto this beer for roughly 5 months but it was in the fridge maybe it improved im not sure
2059,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,3.94,a deep red amber body and a long lasting light tan head tons of aromas raisins  dark fruit plus cherries tastes of dark fruit and malt the mouthfeel was somewhat off putting to me  i was wanting more body as the feel was on the thin side and carbonation was a bit high
2060,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,4.84,if there ever was a perfect looking brew this is it pours an opaque mahogany with a light sand colored head that stands tall and proud frothy foam lace just hangs on the sides of the glass forever smell and taste of dates raisins in malt sweet top front with a ever so slight bitter note on the aftertaste how can one not feel good with this quad 102 abv and lots of carbonation had to round ups to a 5 overall because this is one of my favorite beers this is the craft beer that started me down the road to find a more percent craft brew
2061,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout - Double Barrel Reserve,5,amazing
2062,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout - Double Barrel Reserve,4.75,less maple and coffee presence compared to standard kbbs but more spiritforward on the nose and palate by way of the barrel is it better than regular kbbs yes it is significantly better no essentially kbbs reserve cuts out some of the gas station coffee effect from regular kbbs and delivers a more wellrounded beer it was a great beer that did not live up to the hype
2063,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout - Double Barrel Reserve,5,kbbs on steroids maple and bourbon perfect heat and sweeet this is near perfection it will age perfectly also i need all of this i can get boom
2064,Black Butte XXXV,3.86,pours an effervescent mahogany with a pinky of mocha colored head averageish head retention  lacing  s cocoa roastyness  some cherries nose stays strong  t follows the nose barrel dryness a touch of carob  some leafy hops up front cocoa cherry  a little roastyness dryness as this beer warms up plus some woody hops finishes pretty dry with woody  leafy hops plus a little cherry  cocoa  mf medium body slight carbonation warming got chewier as it warmed up  solid not great ba tale on this style rare that i dig many beers of this style if cherries are featured this is no exception serviceable not memorable
2065,Black Butte XXXV,3.91,many thx to muchloveforhops3 for this bottle  a  dark brown pour with a dense layer of creamy toffee colored foam  s  cocoa cherry and vanilla  t  nice cocoa malt base with cherries and light vanilla blended in  m  big medium soft body that finishes uber wet with warming in the back of the throat  o  deschutes  skip the adjuncts and put this solid base beer in an interesting barrel
2066,Black Butte XXXV,4.12,bottle pour dark as can be with short chocolate milk head leaving frosty lacing nose is roasty malt with hints of cherry and vanilla taste follows with some cocoa notes barrel wood and a bit of alcohol that lingers on the dryish finish a bit milder than expected
2067,Black Butte XXXV,4.48,from a bottle packaged on 060723  nice hiss upon opening with a bit of smoke coming out of the bottle this beer pours pitch black and even when i hold it up to light nothing comes through the head is thick at 3 fingers and extremely long lasting how can the head last this long in an 11 imperial porter once it finally dissipates it leaves a nice bit of lacing on the glass the aroma is quite powerful i get tons of caramel chocolate molasses coffee plum raisin vanilla and cherry these aromas are well balanced and work very well together wow the flavor the cherries start it off and linger throughout they fade a bit as the rest of the crew comes into play lots of chocolate caramel dark fruit molasses coffee all work their way into the party the finish is where the vanilla shines as it works with the cherries theres a tartness from the cherries that cuts into the sweetness that this style can have it provides a nice counter balance thick and full bodied overall not imperial stout levels but very full for a porter getting the faintest hint of heat from the alcohol smooth feeling overall this is an astounding beer in a good way quite happy and impressed with it
2068,Black Butte XXXV,4.35,from the 12 oz bottle in a snifter this solid little brew pours a muddled coal black with a thick head of brown foam that sizzles to a thick ring thin clumping layer and sports some very nice lacing nose of dark coffee tart cherry dark bakers chocolate char and faint bourbon flavors surpass the nose with earthy dark chocolate bourbon vanilla oak char toasted coconut tart cherry and heavy dark coffee mouth feel is full smooth coating medium light carbonation lightly warming and a bitter malt  coffee  dark chocolate finish that is moderately dry  overall a solid little imperial  cheers
2069,Black Butte XXXV,4.25,in thirtyfive years of playing with porter imagination and creativity run amuck as elements of cherry cocoa and vanilla add tangy balance and curiosity to its imperial toasted dark ale of succulence  just the slimmest shade off from black its nearonyx body is capped with a tan whipped mocha froth that sturdily holds onto the glass during the patient session with strong coffee cocoa and burnt toast hovering above the rim its tangy dark fruit scent is highlighted by its tingle of bourbon spice its full and deeply penetrating taste is of wonderfully burnt sugars leading with molasses bakers chocolate and latte early on the palate  with earthen elements of coffee soil smoldering embers and burnt bread seeping into the mouth the brilliant vibrancy of cherry seem to bounce off the tongue with its mild acidic balance soothing with vanilla and lingering caramelization the taste eventually turns coffee bitter with smoldering embers booze soaked oak and nuances of toasted coconut  bittered with coffee and campfire a burnt pinecone taste pulls from the ash and achieves a slight semblance of dryness with spicy bourbon into a finish that echoes chocolate covered cherries in long waves of aftertaste
2070,Black Butte XXXV,3.91,cherry cola beer
2071,Black Butte XXXV,3.5,12oz bottle from boise coop near black pour slight beige head chocolaty aroma light roast taste walks a fine line between chocolate and roasty malts pretty mild for an 11 abv
2072,Black Butte XXXV,4.25,a surprise find at the bottle shop had no idea this seasonal was released yet 12oz bottle poured into a goblet  pours pitchblack and stout dark with a mochacolored cap of head about a fingers worth the nose is earthy and dark with notes of that cocoa oak whiskey tobacco char smoke and dark fruits the cherry only emerges on the finish to me and isnt distracting at all more of a hidden nuance than an overt addition there is an impression of booze that blends with the oaky vanilla and earthy wet tobacco leaf with that cocoa present but never in a sweet confectionary waynice hints of smoke and char toodrying and bitter at times but that keeps the palate moving in an appropriate way  overall i enjoyed it and would drink it again a fine example of a porter
2073,Fest of Both Worlds,3.94,sampled this as a sidebyside with the ja munich fest  pours a clear straw color with a half finger of head the nose is fairly mild  some essence of biscuits and crackers the flavor lacks the nutty character of munich fest but by contrast it is much more malty and fullbodied
2074,Fest of Both Worlds,4.46,received a fourpack courtesy of jzellinger 91123 canned 8723 consumed the first two cans 91223  beer poured golden with a nice white head that has some good hang time  nose is fresh bread and notes of herbal and citrus  taste has a lovely theme of honey bread and is perfectly balanced with hopping that gives a very light touch of pepper and lemon finishes with the toast and honey flavor  mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and smooth  overall what a privilege to be trying this collaboration this is really well done and thoroughly enjoyable thank you jeff
2075,Fest of Both Worlds,4.31,canned 20230807 super excited to try this one pour a large frothy foamy creamy 3 finger head with good retention fair soapy lacing crystal clear pale color  nose fair grainy sweet doughy malts cereal straw a touch of layered complex decoction herbal floral hops with a touch of a grassy and fruity note more cereal grain as it warms and hint of corn  taste brings a balance of hops and malts doughy malt grainy cereal semi grainysweet a touch bready a touch of a biscuity note on the back end a bit of pilsner malt corn fair hops with medlight bitterness floral a bit grassy herbal into a faint piney note and citrusy fruit a hint of the layered decoction mash dry semi crisp finish with med to a bit higher bitterness with a hint of spicy hop note  mouth is med to a bit fuller bod med to higher foamy carb soft lager  overall pretty good i did have super high expectations and it didnt bring as much of the maltforward character i hoped but still a great festbier
2076,Fest of Both Worlds,3.87,pours a beautiful bright golden with white wispy head i get a little white grape on the nose with maybe a bit of unsweetened corn cake its quite grain forward a touch of soapy noble hops its light bodied compared to say a house lager carbonation is super soft something about this isnt hitting for me and i want to like this more
2077,Fest of Both Worlds,4.25,a  pours a nice medium gold color with perfect clarity moderate carbonation and a thin creamy layer of bright white foam resting on top  s  nice herbally earthy citrus spice on the nose the aroma is really quite nice overall  t  nice subtle honey malt base with just the right amount of hops over top to balance the beer out perferctly bright citrus earthyy spice a little bit of pine and a trace of juicy floral really hits the spot  m  big medium body with prickly carbonation that ends soft on the tongue  o  this beer is about as perfect as it gets i could drink this year around really nice and well worth checking out if you like ofest beers
2078,Fest of Both Worlds,4.06,16oz can into a tall glass canned 8923 so a little over 2 weeks old  looks splendid crystal clear golden body small white head persists leaving scattered lacing strong malty aroma which continues in the taste with a light hop note smooth and clean nice finish could drink this all day long
2079,Fest of Both Worlds,4.37,it pours a bright and crystal clear light honey gold enormous head of white fluffiness forms with little encouragement although i tend to pour aggressively it falls to chunks and a ring decent cling outstanding  the smell is deliciously malty  not heavy a bit of a blend of crackery and bread dough the hops are pretty subtle  light citrus and some faint herbal spice some floral over the top very laid back  the taste is deceptive to me it starts off a bit of ho hum but it opens up into a blend of clean malts mild bitterness and then those new world hops blossom lemony brightness floral and herbal earthiness then a mildly surprising kick of spice in the aftertaste so some aspects of noble hops playing with more new world character the bitterness seems appropriate  not quite a complete reset of the taste buds but enough while the aromatic hops continue to play the lemon eventually seems a bit candylike im thinking the malt tends more to the bready side and there is an ever so slight sweetness  the feel is slick and silky smooth medium bodied kind of middle of the road carbonation it has that slightly richer than expected feel ive gotten in other beers using decoction mashing  this is plain old good stuff in my opinion i think both teams brought their a game and the result is a beer that starts of with subtlety and finishes in a wholly different place looking at the style description this beer could be the poster child ridiculously drinkable
2080,Carling Beer,2.02,cerveza popular en inglaterra tiene una gran cabeza blanca es de cuerpo ligero y con alta carbonataci√≥n aroma y sabor c√≠trico para tomar con pocas pretensiones
2081,Carling Beer,2.93,had this in a few different pubs in england  its nothing special and it isnt even really good but imo its still better than bud light  im an ipa man myself but i wanted to try something different was still better than a few of the aalepl i had in europe
2082,Carling Beer,2.79,from a can pours a bright gold colour with a good thick white head that disapates but laces well aroma grass grain bread corn taste malt corn malt sweet crisp and clean
2083,Carling Beer,3.25,from hipecor 50cl can in ikeas pint glass reading cshtp6 ch7 much more balanced than other adjunt lagers with the corn little noticeable very drinkable and smooth good body for its low abv
2084,Carling Beer,2.25,pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing aroma has slight malt hints the taste follows the nose with a slight nalt flavor a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a decent beer
2085,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.87,pouring this is a must dont just drink out of a can or bottle beautiful color and excellent head retention make this a beauty on your table or desk or wherever youre enjoying it the smell of hazelnut and chocolate hit you every sip the taste is so rich but not overpowering great taste of the malt and hops mix perfectly a weird side note this beer is still damn good even if your glass gets a little warm
2086,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.28,an overall lovely ale with a slightly stronger taste of malt than i would prefer and slightly less sweet than i feel it should be for that perfect balance really glad to have tried it and would like to have it on draft someday
2087,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,2.8,pours dark brown with caramel foam no obvious scent tastes of nuts and brown sugar with quick finish average beer at best
2088,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.53,12 oz can canned 030822  poured to a duvel snifter pours a dark ruby body some bubbles show when held to the light thick finger of frothy khakitan head that leaves good spotty lacing aroma is pleasantly toasty  nutty definitely invokes an authentic sense of earth  nuts  peanut  hazelnut slightly minerally  metallic flavor profile has some muddled notes to it earthy herbal bitter with notes of dark fruits cherries figs dates almost retains a tart cherry juice sort of quality not sure if this is due to the age of the beer or what hazelnut is not exactly the main player here if you ask me does retain some earthy nuttiness peanut hazelnut but tastes more earthy  herbal  hoppy than anything else not as roasty as expected feel is smooth crisp fairly easydrinking carbonation is good  overall a middle of the road offering from rogue in my opinion surprised to see that this beer has such high ratings here on the site  rogue hazelnut brown nectar 355
2089,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.75,medium brown to dark caramel in color with a caramel beige head that briefly flashes and dissipates very nutty in taste and aroma a good brown ale with lots of hazlenut notes pretty simple otherwise
2090,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.23,nothing to write home about a funny combination of simple flavors with a limp finish hazelnut taste is good but not very present
2091,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.76,dark brown mostly transparent brown head slowly dissipates and leaves nice lacing nutty odor on nose hazelnut flavor is present as is a pungent flavor i dont really like feel is average its ok but i dont want it again
2092,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.07,from a can into a pint glass pour has a vibrant slowly receding head of light biege foam that tops a fantastic amber brown body that is generally clear but with uniform particulate throughout scent has the pretty typical nuttiness of a brown ale with sweeter notes of toffee and hazelnut rounding it out and almost wholly avoiding the sometimes bitter scents of a brown ale taste is an incredibly well balanced blend of subtle nuttiness and hazelnut with a just a smidge of bitterness peeking out feel is very smooth with a pleasant aftertaste that follows the taste well an all around excellent fall beer that is very very drinkable
2093,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.26,this one i really like  poured a deep reddish auburn with a tan head that didnt last that long but overall it still looked good in the glass  aroma and taste lived up to the hazelnut hype and even the nectar part as the feel was a bit thick and went down with a great deal of satisfaction  this one had a nice complexity between hops malt and hazelnut i will absolutely buy it again it was also nice to have an english brown ale as this style is not very common in south tx
2094,Goose IPA,4.15,pours a light copper and straw extremely clear pure white head that laces really well very rocky with multiple sized bubbles  smells of light citrus pine and malt sweetness some kind of candy flavor that i cant pinpoint  tastes like an old school ipa with classic c hops pine and grapefruit just enough malt backbone to balance it out a little grassiness in the finish that follows with a really nice crisp bitterness to finish it off a little bit of chrw to the beer as it finishes  mouthfeel is a little chewy strong carbonation and a little slick  i really like this not an over the top ipa but a very nice balanced and delicious ipa that i will buy again
2095,Goose IPA,3.92,nice crisp refreshing medium light mildly bitter west coast ipa
2096,Goose IPA,5,on tap in terminal 4 at bwi airport rr seafood bar 950 for a 20 ounce draft beer had a great smooth taste and overall feel would definitely get it again in future
2097,Goose IPA,3.61,one can recognize the adherence to the style of the english style ipas which i do respect however i often have grapefruit for breakfast  ss   grapefruit beer in the evening  well  a bit repetitive   still an ok overall well constructed beer a nice drinkable crisp ipa
2098,Goose IPA,2.97,nice orange color with a copious persistent head but aroma was minimal hop flavor was onedimensional mostly bitter with a hint of umami light to medium bodied  to me an ipa should have at least 6 abv this one falls a little short it looks like an ipa and thats about all
2099,Goose IPA,4.07,look pretty foamy top smell very clean pleasant floral aroma the smell reminds me of jasmine tea taste the first several sip is interesting it has bitterness and a floral taste the after taste is not that interesting
2100,Extra Dry,2.13,696ml  clear glass bottle nabbed at bottle mart port douglas australia  insipid hitting on 6row and a faint cornlike adjunct note but nothing else stupidly simple with a neutral flavour but id stop short of calling it wateryit does have body  i guess this is a beer id pair with overly spicy thai food or atomic hot buffalo wings but only then because i wouldnt be wasting a beer with actual flavour  d  not recommended
2101,Extra Dry,2.17,tooheys extra dry or teds as theyre colloquially known in australia is a well known mass produced adjunct lager that had its heyday in the early to mid 2000s originally brewed at 5 its alcohol content has decreased significantly to 44 once a popular beer amongst teenagers and young adults looking for a quick easy buzz it was marketed as an easy drinking lager and gained notoriety with music festivals and outdoor events nowadays its less popular and tooheys are attempting to revive it by playing on its declining popularity with a marketing campaign of being proudly ordinary  look standard aussie mass produced adjunct lager look to it golden hue medium size head soap sudsy looking which disappated quickly to a white bubbling slick its an aussie lager it looks pretty standard  smell classic aussie adjunct lager smell grainy faint fruity hop aroma bready yeast a little chemically almost like a citrus air freshener a little bit of egg white  taste sweet maltiness slight fruitiness not overly bitter light graininess  the dryness lingers in the palate and tastes a bit chemically quite bland even for an aussie adjunct lager  feel light refreshing when icecold highly carbonated tastes like a beer that youre going to knock back several of without really caring about what youre drinking youre drinking it for the buzz it will eventually give you if you knock back enough of them  overall i like many australians drank a fair bit of this back in the day when we were young dumb and thinking we were cool i remember many a headache afterwards and associated nasty hangovers with this stuff i must say it certainly isnt as good as it once was and the fact that tooheys are advertising it as proudly ordinary is really all that needs to be said about teds its an ordinary beer nothing fancy its not trying to be stylish its there to serve a purpose and not to be savoured although i dont know how much longer than can keep marketing this when they keep knocking down the abv its going to be midstrength the way its going before too long following in the footsteps of the carlton cold
2102,Extra Dry,2.94,its crisp dry finish is achieved by an extended fermentation ensuring minimal residual fermentable sugars wonderful fruity malty notes accompany a mellow middle palate leaving a clean aftertaste
2103,Extra Dry,1.79,one of the worst beers i have ever drank was a task to finish would not recommend
2104,Extra Dry,2.78,format a clear 345ml bottle with a transluscent label looks okay  appearance pours an ambergolden colour with bubbling carbonation a thin halffinger of head drops to a thin film and ring limited lacing  aroma pretty typical lager with light hops and light cereal adjunct grains okay  taste pretty much follows the nose this comes across as being a beer that is designed to be put away quickly without thinking about it too much  aftertaste light cereal grains here again without much bitterness  mouth feel light in feel with medium to higher carbonation clean and crisp  overall an okay macro lager but there are better even at this price range at au40 a case
2105,Extra Dry,2.37,malty little floral yeasty after taste
2106,Temptation,4.44,375ml bottle corked and caged label is marked for the bottling date of 021722 mostly clear pale gold colored body one thin finger of white head sticks around aroma of oak white wine and grape and funk leather taste is chardonnay grapes oak and leathertobacco funk lower level of tartness really dries up in the aftertaste very soft medium plus mouth feel very dry finish very good carbonation prominent brett qualities along with the oak wine barrel influences terrific palate cleanser
2107,Temptation,4.2,look it pours golden and brilliantly clear with a white head head retention is low  smell it has a strong wine character from the chardonnay with some earthly flavors there are some grape notes with a hint of leather  taste it has wine flavors with grapes there are very low leather and earthen elements there are some wood elements  feel it has a medium body with moderately strong sourness  overall this beer is quite wine like but not to the point where it drinks like a wine
2108,Temptation,2.58,have to call it as i see it just a terrible beer ive had others from russian river and this should be removed from their offerings figure they would have something based on a wine being in the napa area but just had no enjoyable qualities at all most scores from ba have been somewhat accurate but a 98 for this is just stunning dont waste your time or money imo this score is completely way off base
2109,Temptation,4.04,poured from 1268 ounce bottle into a tulip glass  look pale gold very hazy no visible particulate sudsy white head below average head retention and lacing  smell white grape oak chardonnay mildly brett  taste white grape chardonnay sour finish  feel thin body clean finish very dry finish sourness induces saliva gentle carbonation  overall a wild ale with an abundance of chardonnay characteristics this is a large descent from the beer styles i typically drink but was an enjoyable new experience
2110,Temptation,4.2,a friend of mine visited colorado for a family christmas and he brought back a bunch of rr goodies 123121 including this 375ml bottle for 1499 bottled 11421 consumed 4722  beer poured deep golden with a pretty good white head  nose is very nice a nice combination of horse blanket white wine and a touch of sourness  taste follows the nose with a light but fairly substantial malt base that initially comes across as a sweet tart but has some funky leather finishes very dry and oaky  mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with each sip  overall a sour that is very well done and does not obliterate my sour sensitive palate
2111,Temptation,4.15,pretty color with a nice head on an aggressive pour smells fruity tastes sour and dry comfortable feeling in the mouth but a little after bite
2112,Temptation,4.32,on tap at iron abby in horsham pa pours a hazy gold with thin white head smells of grapes and oak nice tart flavor and finishes with a little tartness on the tongue a very nice sipping beer
2113,Temptation,4.28,bottled 11421  oh man its about damn time i get to try some of the russian river wilds i managed to wrangle up 4 different ones and plan to try them in order of lowest to highest ranking starting here just short of the top 250 at 310 im too excited so lets just get into it  pours an opaque pale gold with a finger of white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  oh man this is super funky in the nose im picking up on aromas of earthy white wine wet hay old leather sharp oak lemon juice pear apple skin and light white pepper  the funk really keeps up in taste its soft and delicate up front yet tart and funky on the finish on the front end of the sip im tasting dry white wine pear skin white grape smooth oak and light apple the swallow brings notes of earthy white wine sharp oak wet hay clove lemon juice apple skin and leather  a light medium body pairs with moderate tingling carbonation resulting in a sharp beer finishes quite dry and funky  this one is very good but the straight up funk holds it back just a little bit still its masterfully done and i cant wait to try the rest
2114,Temptation,4.27,had a 2014 on tap in 2022 look  clear golden color with a nice white head and slight lacing shocked it looks this good smell  grainy tart citrus guessing the aging brought it to this smell but still fantastic taste  floral tart with a slight citrus feel  medium body with a crisp carb overall  really great beer would love to try fresh and see the difference
2115,Temptation,4.76,had this right after pty been wanting to try this almost as long as pliny certainly one of the top sours i havent been able to try fathom bistro  bar on shelter island san diego so much funk and delicious barrel character the definition of a sour blonde wayyyy to easy to drink wow
2116,Temptation,4.46,golden color nicely hazy with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly the nose is green grape lemon oak and da funky brett  the taste is very refined with the green grape and funky brett up front and the oak and lemon at the back of the palate with a lingering flavor profile that is delicious  the mouthfeel is bright and fizzy per the style an excellent wild ale imho
2117,Temptation,4.62,bottled 3272020 poured in tulip excellent chardonnay aroma with slight earthy notes chardonnay is the main note in the taste followed by some apple and pear very dry and bitter tasty
2118,Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots,1.02,taste like st
2119,Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots,2.7,not the worst taste for price and  hard on the stomach and body toxic
2120,Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots,4.74,fucking amazing there is no better beer on the market
2121,Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots,3.06,as of august 13th 2016 they changed the size of the can now its 236 ml was 250ml  now it taste even stronger the price also went up strong taste of alcohol jst like taking a shot of vodka  smooth smell  smooth aftertaste worth the price because its cheap shit  good for a nice summer day and on a budget stronger then it use to be might be less water in a smaller can not sure worth a try nothing special if u want a special beer buy craft brews
2122,Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots,2.63,purchased at the lcbo as a single and served at 4deg c in a draught glass  a opens well and pours a 1 high white head that lasts a minute before film out light to medium gold colour and filtered clear  s not much here at all really bad scent like a metal can  t not so good not so happy just an alcohol bomb  m a north american brew that has a niche people that dont have time or the stomach to drink good brew bet you its people that a stopping on the side of the highway to slam two beer as its a different charge to drink a brew while driving but stopping and pounding two outside the car is not dui lol  food pairing  this not so great beer went well with i dont know its just a brew designed to slug and drive or slug and whatever lol  enjoy if you can
2123,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.09,16 oz can poured into mason jar look one and a half finger head does not stay long golden color good lacing smell malt with hints of sweetness taste medium bitterness not extraordinary not bad finish is ok feel nice carbonation stays on tongue after swallowing overall i could take it or leave it i would not seek it out if there were others of the style pair with seafood
2124,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),2.51,24oz can date code sep2721 poured into a pint glass  a  pours a clear yellow with a thin white head that leaves a little bit of lacing head retention is fair lots of small bubbles rising through the glass  s  primarily malts and adjuncts theres a bandagelike funk that shows up near the end of the nose thats a bit offputting  t  malty with a caramellike sweetness no discernable hop character the funk present on the nose doesnt reveal itself in the taste  m  mediumbodied with average carbonation and a smooth sweet finish drinkability is good provided it stays cold  o  for a regular strength ml 59 its serviceable but better options exist ymmv
2125,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),2.82,i have one idea what it looks like drank it straight from the can after fishing it from an iced down communal beer cooler in the middle of a pakistani valero at ih10 and fry are on the outskirts of houston it was as you might have guessed ice cold i only detected a sulphurous slightly putrid smell the taste is as slightly sweet artificial grape drink drank purple slight alcohol warmth it tastes a lot like despair im so glad i only had 16 oz to drink it will get the job done if you want a buzz but theres much better ways to achieve that for the same price
2126,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.68,16 oz can dec0919 purchased cold single poured into fat tulip  l brilliantlyclear pale yellowamber liquid tall semitight silky white foam builds high slow crumble thin collar remains a few islands of suds as well some lace but much of it slides away  s dried apple hint of white grape atop a powdereddonut doughy malt base soft clove spice subtle cookieish baked grain note no one element really stands out fairmoderate potency malt fades in favor of spice and dried pomme  t expected a little more base sweetness upon first sip but its merely a mellow whitebready dry malt foundation the spice is even rather subdued lingering with a delicate boost of booze in the aftertaste taste gets more muddy as it goes bit of a medicinal alcohol builds in the back halfway through slight nutty yeast aftertaste by the end  f satiny smooth little afterburn arguably a tad watery in the finish arguably needs a lil more heat otherwise dream drag and drop  o last saw this summer 2015 but failed to pull the trigger  been looking for it since an openminded venture into an anecdotally seedy dive bar in my buddys town reaped its reward of sorts basically just the review disappointingly a little too bland of a taste but fantastically drinkable 1518
2127,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),2.11,first impression  d  not recommended   070819 can  a bit sweet and a biteen syrupy but not as off putting as many budget malt liquors corn 6row cooked grain has a warm alcohol undertone thats unpleasant but not intolerable  no overt hop flavours are present to any extent not metallic or otherwise off  unrefreshing but drinkable ive had worse student tipples in my day wouldnt be a repeat buy with mickeys on the market  d  not recommended
2128,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),4.76,poured from a 12oz can into a imperial pint glass it has a toasted malt aroma and a decent flavor to match good old style aal
2129,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3,to me the king of malt liquors overall i would rate it as average because there are none from this category i would consider outstanding is a sweet smelling and tasting brew light bodied but extremely poundable lets be honest if your drinking mls youre not looking for sipping brews
2130,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),2.62,l thick head decent lacing deep golden color  s sweet malt and corn fairly weak  t very sweet basically no hops inoffensive but not very rich or grainy  f medium bodied with very clean finish not as carbonated as the xl schlitz malt liquor red bull  overall you could do worse than this one but its not even better than oe 800 i like the red bull xl schlitz better as it is not as sweet a middle of the road malt liquor that is worth a try but not worth going out of your way for
2131,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),4.94,this economy beer is a major contender with top notch brews for the price i recommend you skip pabst miller and coors go for the bull the look is super clear light straw in appearance the presentation of the can is fair since this is a economic beer i suppose the design is not bad the nose is sweet and yeasty with some slight spoiled grain smell meh the smell is boring for flavor this is not exceptional but very similar to miller high life top end sweetness with faint yeastwhite bread notes quickly goes into some maltiness and hop bitterness in the middle the finish is a little wet i really enjoyed the body of this beer good sting carbonation that pricks your pallet with a fantastic creamy texture as it goes down very nice medium body as you drink the hops and ethyl acetate build up on your pallet rendering your taste buds useless i believe schlitz malt liquor tastes much better than miller high life due to the fact high life has a thin body and a overwhelming canned vegetable taste this beer has none of that if you are looking for something with more flavor and more alcohol hit i recommend this beer
2132,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.67,pours a clear bright golden yellow with medium head smell is pretty light corn and grain taste is sweet malt grain and a hint of apple in the finish better than expected
2133,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.1,one of the better malt liquors out there and i have tried about all of them i remember the old commercial dont say beer say bull if i want a little boost during an afternoon of draining cans i generally alternate the bull and whatever aal is in the fridge at the time not wonderful but it does the job and i have never sputtered in disgust when taking a sipchug of one of these then again i dont ask for much between all of the smoking i did in my younger days thankfully behind me and all of the spicy foods i like now my taste buds may be subpar good for me cause i will drink about anything
2134,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),5,schlitz oml is a great malt liquor just hard to find so you end up drinking what is available near home or close

2140,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.26,batch 5  pours the deepest of dark browns no head bourbon and leather on the nose masking some almond and perhaps also some dried fruit my partner says twizzlers and i can see that too under the omnipresence of bourbon i get raisin brown sugar then cola and fig on the finish this is good albeit a little sweet which does make it hard to get to completion if you are drinking this on its own which if you spent a lot of money on the bottle you are probably feeling this way anyway its a good beer and barleywine i think the barrel character the oak couldve been more rugged but it has plenty of boozy character

2143,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.3,this was supposed to be a legendary barley wine it was also a very expensive barley wine maybe my palate is not developed enough to tell the difference between this and other ba barley wines look typical caramel color smell toffee dark fruit taste follows he nose feel medium body overall i gave it an overall rating of 4 due to the price i just cant justify 100 for a 12 ounce bottle one and done for me not worth the price

2147,Abrasive Ale,4.85,i am so happy to have finally found this locally pa after searching for it for years it did not disappoint while the can is over a couple of months old the ale still tasted very fresh i rate it as having a ne flavor profile while having a west coast appearance it is translucent and golden but definitely not cloudy the head was white and not too foamy the aromas came in waves of sweet fruit the flavor came in waves and it seemed each one was a different type of tropical fruit what a fantastic drinking experience the only downside was the 5 price tag but that would be a bargain in a tavern
2148,Abrasive Ale,4.24,canned 11722 1 month ago  appearance pours a slightly cloudy 80 clarity medium orange color with a strong white head srm of 9 400  aroma strong aromas of rich grapefruit tropical mango and melon resinous earthy and tropical some tropical peach evolves as it warms 425  flavor flavors follow the nose with strong tropical grapefruit pineaple mangomelon with a sweet peach undertone a moderate balance of sweet and smooth caramel balanced by bitter pine notes 425  feel heavier bodied strong carbonation and finishes sweet but surprisingly clean and drinkable on the palate 425  compared to revolution antihero ipa 122022 pours lighter stronger aromas more juicy grapefruit tropical pineapple melon and peaches less resinous nectarine and syrup juicier but also more balanced with pine bitterness winner surly  compared to surly axe man 22023 pours darker hazier stronger aromas more sweet and juicy tangerine and peach less dank berry and pine notes  overall wow a surprisingly fantastic ipa here grapefruit tropical pineapple mangomelon and peach flavors juicy with enough pine and grapefruit citrus rind to balance beldns neipa juicy flavors with westcoast body and mouthfeel sort of reminds me of half acres ipa blends and not unlike axe man in many ways rating 424
2149,Abrasive Ale,4.11,review 1713 abrasive ale surly brewing imperial ipa date 17 dec 2021 another beer that i have wanted to be marked off my list the beer is 46 degrees and i used a tulip glass a frothy and airy twofingered bright white head was created the slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass the color charts around srm 6 deep golden yellow clarity is brilliant with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within the appearance of the beer is excellent ripe grapefruit and juicy melon are what i immediately pick up smelling beer again i detect pine bready yeasty honeylike sweetness oranges floral esters and herbal interesting i get pineapple mango grapefruit floral and herbal notes from the first sip taking another i taste bread dough oranges pine lightly toasted malts pharmaceutical and a touch of dank the mouthfeel is sticky sweet and coating the body is medium the carbonation is low and the finish lingers this is not what i was expecting for this beer the malts are heavy and drown out the hops the hop profiles are unique in is own way i was expecting something like a wcipa and got a hybrid i would not say this beer is abrasive when i think of an abrasive beer i think of ruination the first one not this newer crap the beer is okay nothing special stands out as amazing
2150,Peche Du Fermier,4.58,look  thick peach juice with a nice white head rimming and lacing smell  complex ripe candied tart peach taste  follows close to the smell with a nice woody oak backbone feel  medium bdoy and carb overall  just fantastic
2151,Peche Du Fermier,4.55,pours bright orange with a foggy transparency head is a finger and a half of snowwhite foam a few particulates sit at the bottom of the glass but not much after pouring the first half of the bottle into the glass the level of suspended particulate changes when the last 15th of the bottle is poured into the glass it develops a more murky appearance with visible silt and particulate in the bottom of the glass aroma is immediate peaches but theyre soft and delicate it leans slightly into tart but is otherwise well balanced thanks to the subtle peach sweetness faint cellar stone oak and grass occupy the rest of the nose rounding out the depth peaches seem to swell in intensity as the beer warms towards room temperature flavor profile leads with peaches again but leans into tart more so than the nose its a pretty quick transition from sweet peach to tart fruits cellar stone grass lemon zest and soft wood front third is fruited with the back third being all base saison the middle is a blend of the start and finish just like the nose the peaches swell up in intensity as the beer warms to room temperature and with that it brings those underlying tart qualities forward still no puckering sourness but it does create more contrast between tart and nontart no puckering or tart finish with the finale wrapping up with a moderate dryness mouth feel is medium in thickness it nearly falls flat on the tongue with the initial portion being crisp overall peach addition is wonderful with the rest of the profile being a steadfast focused and balanced saison its not overly acidic or tart providing just enough tartness to offer contrast without forcing it into sour territory  blend 2 served in a 155oz speigalau tulip from a 750ml bottle
2152,Hopsecutioner,3.51,82023 sams club
2153,Hopsecutioner,3.94,one of those beers of fame that i somehow have not had until now a draft pour an iconic beer but it probably meant more when its peer group was smaller the first thing ive had from terrapin in way too long nice beer but in some ways it has a ton of equals now everyone caught up perhaps looks like they used to lightly brassy to copper mostly clear with some low shine a fine almost inch of thick and lasting white head craggy and rocky and leaving lace as it drinks it smells like minerals from the malt a little crystal malt richness but still american tons of relatively fresh hops wrapped into it grapefruit for sure could be simcoe driven spicy northwestern vibes too orange zest cantaloupe and pine its resinous and it seems to be bitter but its not overly intense as they go at least by todays standards classically balanced and without anything from the yeast the flavor is similar grapefruit for sure white pine boards tangerine herbal bitters and actual high alpha hop bitterness set against or rather alongside and together with slightly nutty pale barley malt sweet like toffee but for just a flash in the middle then bready and baked and in a support role this is really nice fresh in this instance and with some linger it plays in that iconic space lagunitas ipa and the like drinkable for its strength and because its got great proportionality but it also didnt hit me in this day and age as something real special either good but just an ipa not being critical it just seems familiar good to get to drink some terrapin stuff i always forget they have corporate ownership now
2154,Hopsecutioner,3.88,12 oz can best by dec 07 2023 acquired the 6 pack from the janesville wisconsin woodmans ironic how beer brewed in georgia is available in wisconsin yet i never see it in illinois but i digress  a pours a nice burnt golden  orange strong finger point five of frothy sudsy offwhite head looks floatish color is nice reminiscent of how they used to make ipas s earthy twiggy grassy not overly hoppy or piney or resinous despite the six hop varieties that went into this notes of caramel  bready biscuit malt t the taste is nice but surely not designed to break or crash any new ground bitter slightly piney good balance of bread malts its simple but nice f decent feel smooth creamy body feels super light especially for being over 7 abv with the alcohol being not noticeable at all  overall i would call it slightly above average but definitely decent especially in these days where hazy swill lines all the shelves  terrapin hopsecutioner 45
2155,Hopsecutioner,3.5,tastes like a pepsicola  style ipa  tapcanbottle can  abv 73  rating 35
2156,Hopsecutioner,3.95,appearance clear gold thin white head with moderate retention  aroma citrus herbal and pine  flavor and aftertaste citrus herbal and pine aggressive bitterness low sweetness  mouthfeel drying low to moderate carbonation high stringency moderate length finish with sticky trailing bitterness  overall wc style ipa lands with a compliment of citrus herbal and piney aromas and flavors pretty aggressive bitterness that is coating and lasts well into the finish uses warrior chinook simcoe centennial and cascade hops
2157,Hopsecutioner,4.2,look  golden small white head no lacing left behind smell  bready piney citrusy taste  citrus pine caramel fruity malty feel  medium light body moderate carbonation hoppy sticky finish overall  hoppy malty backbone caramel sweetness and fruity mouthfeel is a bit light theres a piney resin and fruity candy flavor on the finish great job by terrapin using six different hops to create a solid west coast ipa thats why i paired hopsecutioner with going back to cali by sevendust heavy duty
2158,Hopsecutioner,4.19,look pours a copper shade of deep golden amber with a generous two finger off white head foam laces the glass exceptionally well  aroma pine tar the kind youd put on a baseball bat some sweet notes of granola and orange peel in the background a little bit of lemon peel and pickled ginger  taste decently bitter but not to a gobsmacking degree follows the nose good amount of pine resin and bitter orange upfront followed by chewy notes of caramel and granola ends on more spicy pine resin with just the slightest hint of orange taffy  feel midheavy body somewhat chewy and thick dry  overall solid ipa
2159,Hopsecutioner,4.12,old school wcipa nice
2160,Hopsecutioner,4.02,pours out of the can a crystal clear copper with an inch of head with good retention smells of sweet malts slightly floral and the taste follows the nose very little bitterness and a solid full mouthfeel not too complicated but nothing making this a bad beer by any means
2161,Hopsecutioner,3.95,appearance pours an orangish amber color with an offwhite foam head leaves behind some lacing  aroma semi sweet biscuity malts dark fruit and tangerineish aroma a little earthy  taste ripe orange citrus spice a malty backbone  overall this is unique to say the least
2162,Hopsecutioner,3.9,can pour into a tulip glass gold amber appearance with a moist sticky head citrus and apricot nose fruity malty flavor full body good carbonation
2163,Bomb!,4.46,l pours a dark hickory forms no head and a very thin espresso ring around the edge of the snifter no noticeable lacing or retention with a distinctive oily character has a crunchy dark chocolate hue when held to the light  s cacao nibs bourbon barrel oak vanilla and coffee hints of chili heat  t strong coffee roast cacao nibs vanilla and roasted malts slightly astringent faint chili burn in finish  f medium to fullbodied thick creamy mouthfeel moderate carbonation  o the sun rises in the east prairie delivers another outstanding stout
2164,Bomb!,4.47,got a bottle of this from charleston beer exchange years ago finally getting a chance to try it and i am stocked i have had this fresh on draft but that was probably 6 years ago and i was unable to get a review done  pours pitch black with a small wispy toffee colored head sporadic lacing aroma is coffee and chocolate and figs and alcohol mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking slightly watered down but wonderful flavor overall i enjoyed the draft version more and this bottle was a bit of a letdown solid beer but plenty better
2165,Bomb!,4.75,look exceptionally dark brown almost black very thin mocha colored head minor lacing  smell very wellmixed chocolate and vanilla fight for dominance moderately strong coffee and malt  taste follows the nose the chocolate vanilla coffee and malt sweetness are all present nothing is overpowering no real taste of chile peppers until the back end see feel  feel rich silky velvety and smooth low carbonation as expected given the style and the 13 abv warmth from the alcohol during and after swallow tingling spice on the tongue from the chile peppers long after the swallow  overall one of the best  and possibly the best  adjunct imperial stout i have ever had the fortune of trying exquisitely wellbalanced flavors
2166,Bomb!,4.54,this one is rich dark and creamy i taste all the flavors except the heat from the chiles maybe since its a year old the chiles have subsided still a fantastic brew
2167,Bomb!,4.44,pours a dark brown color with virtually no head aroma of sweet coffee and roasted malts taste is coffee vanilla and chocolate with a nice warm alcohol finish excellent brew
2168,Bomb!,4.24,look is black with a dark brown head that dissipates quickly with very little lacing aroma is coffee chocolate and a hint of pepper taste is strong with coffee and cacao and pepper and bitterness feel is not as smooth as some stouts but it works well with the chili pepper taste the glass looked like it had a lot of carbonation but its not noticeable while drinking the 13 abv is not noticeable very nice
2169,Bomb!,4.75,amazing stout would try again and would buy again
2170,Bomb!,4.43,look black with a dark brown head  smell vanilla raisins coffee chocolate  taste nice blend of vanilla coffee and chocolate with just the slightest hint of pepper  feel super smooth
2171,Bomb!,4.6,poured from a 12 ounce bottle dated 12022 into a snifter  look black opaque plentiful visible particulate at the edges dark brown frothy head zero head retention below average lacing but coats glass wall  smell cacao coffee chili pepper vanilla high strength of scent  taste cacao coffee chili pepper at finish moderately bitter high strength of flavor  feel between medium and full body well below average carbonation mildly spicy moderately mouth warming mildly mouth coating moderately bitter syrup like  overall black in color with visible particulate at the edges and zero head retention bouquet was high in strength with a great mix of cacao coffee and chili pepper taste was also high in strength with the same wonderful flavor profile feel was between medium and full bodied with mild spiciness and moderate mouth warming ability overall this was a really great beer that provided an excellent drinking experience the only critique i had was that the carbonation was noticeably weak but that could have been a oneoff
2172,Bomb!,4.22,from a 12oz bottle dated 031722 served in a tulip  pours a slightly thickappearing chestnutblack with a finger of dense mocha foam the head holds up for thirty seconds or so  actually pretty good considering the abv  leaving a scant collar and a barely rousable spattering of superslippery lacing  nose is rich and chocolatey aromas of milk chocolate and chilis  taste is candy barlike mildly sweet nutty and lightly roasted sweetened coffee taste is present but dominated by lindttype milk chocolate at the beginning then by ancho chili and vanilla on the back end tasting demerara sugar mocha java ancho chili and vanilla theres a subtle nutty peanut buttery character at the end and into the aftertaste  feel is smooth and creamy not much more than medium bodied i think but further lightened by the ample fine carbonation its a notably clean mouthfeel considering the style the abv and the various adjuncts  overall nice cleandrinking and tasty only lightly sweet and not at all syrupy at least comparable to many of the finer imperial stouts ive met but perhaps at a more regrettably unattractive relative price point
2173,Bomb!,4.65,l thick motor oil poured from a 12oz bottle into a sniffer  slight head risen no light shining through this one s big coffee aromas followed by chocolate vanilla and a slight spicy smell to it reminds me of a ducato imperial stout that was made with chili peppers t ohhh wow definitely an amazing beer huge spicy chili chocolate up front followed by a easy vanilla ride to the coffee profile in the after taste man oh man this one is top 5 in the books f spicy acidic heavy bodied beer  not to carbonated easy to drink cant taste the alcohol at all o this reminds me of a similar imperial stout made with spices that resemble chili peppers this for me is a barrel aged version of ducato verdi imperial stout but with different characteristics that make it much more complex such as a spicy bakers chocolate upfront taste followed by a smooth vanilla ride to the end where the coffee after taste lingers very well done and a solid a for me
2174,Bomb!,4.25,appearance  dark mahogany body with tan head  smell  chocolate fudge chili pepper  taste  chocolate fudge mocha vanilla chili pepper  mouthfeel  medium bodied full carbonation chocolaty upfront slight heat from the pepper in the middle fudgy on the finish no hint of booze at this abv  overall  this is a good beer great sipping for those chilly nights not quite worth the price of admission 10 which i did not pay
2175,DFPF,4.26,on tap at bayberry beer hall  well i wasnt expecting bayberry to have the ba highest rated berliner weisse on tap for their 6th anniversary party but im hyped that they do lets get into it  pours a clear ruby reddish with a finger of pinkish red head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing  honestly the nose on this one isnt anything too impressive i dig it but its a bit sweet im picking up on aromas of cherry candy passion fruit pineapple juice crackery malt lemon zest light dragonfruit and vanilla  oh no i stand corrected that is much better in taste nicely tart and well balanced on the front end of the sip im tasting passion fruit underripe mango lemon juice apricot gummy straw apple cider vinegar dragonfruit and tart cherry the swallow brings notes of lemon juice pineapple juice dragonfruit cherry candy crackery malt underripe mango and a touch of vanilla  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a a crisp beer finishes slightly sticky but the feel isnt ruined by it  this is very solid stuff it doesnt quite live up to my expectations but it was still great to try
2176,DFPF,4.21,brewers notes berliner weisse brewed with dragon fruit and passion fruit  saw the 1 rated berliner weiss at empire liquors hello yes please   chilled clear bomber bottle to show off the big pink liquid ruby red liquid capped by a pink fizzy foam cap that quickly fades when poured into a schilling stemmed glass  aroma is passion fruit and i guess dragon fruit  taste is passion fruit tart  not too sweet  and i guess again dragon fruit  fizzy  sudsy mouthfeel that settles to a tart tanginess  cleancrisp tangy  good beer
2177,DFPF,3.83,bites of fruit flesh as you sip through this very bright end vibrant look aid spritz
2178,DFPF,4.9,69 the real deal holyfield
2179,Insert Hip Hop Reference There,4.64,this is a great tasting ipa nice citra flavor nice mouth feel and definitely hoppy its a triple so the hoppiness is to be expected the mouth feel is very good but not the best i have had definitely a world class beer nice job

2183,Michelob Ultra,5,its so smooth very easy drinking enjoy it at a bbq or a hot summer day after yard work it quenches your thirst and you can have a bunch of them very crushable i recommend it cheers
2184,Michelob Ultra,2.1,71223 drank straight from a 12 oz bottle so much of my style points come from the nice bottle   purchased a six pack of 12 oz bottles for my cousin shauns upcoming visit this is his fav  first note i am suprised to get a buzz for what my taste buds are saying is lightly and i mean lightly flavored beer sparkling water what an odd sensation today was a very hot humid day of work and i must say that this hit the spot for a cool off after work would i enjoy this for an enjoyable taste session absolutely not however at a hot picnic get together and this was the only offering its better than nothing
2185,Michelob Ultra,3.25,not to bad
2186,Michelob Ultra,2.55,its alright
2187,Michelob Ultra,2.5,a skanky corn yellow straw  s bruised malt a german train car cigarettes  t  creamed corn some mild bitterness aluminum  m surprisingly good  o junk and i am usually way above average for aal ratings if you want a light beer done right look at the hofbrau session or a miller this one sucks
2188,Michelob Ultra,1.7,this is some abysmal stuff no sense of beer detected really doesnt even taste like beerflavored water for just 1 of additional abv a person could enjoy a truly delicious high life this product makes no sense to me unless youre drinking a hundred beers a day the calorie difference is negligible from an actually fullflavored aal
2189,Michelob Ultra,1.8,like water very little smell and taste extremely light
2190,Michelob Ultra,3.45,i had one today for free at the finish line of a 25 kilometer race that i ran everyone around me has a perrin grapefruit ipa but i was satisfied with my choice in this context  cant really rate look or feel drinking from an aluminum bottle
2191,Michelob Ultra,3.59,easily one of my favorite light beers and one of anhauserbuschs best products this product is truly refreshing and does its wonders during a hot summer day when you need something to cool you down its extremely light so you could easily crush a couple of these guys with no problem this product offers a unique after taste that many light american beers lack not the beer of choice if you want to expirence intoxication which is why this losses some points however the first sip will immediately brighten your mode
2192,Michelob Ultra,3.64,it was an ok beer it was the first beer i ever tried very bland compared to most in my opinion it was free so that was why i tried it i had never really considered it before receiving it as a christmas gift its not something i can see myself buying if its free though ill take it
2193,Michelob Ultra,2.22,presentation 12 ounce cans poured into a pint glass  looks like a pale yellow color minimal head  smells smells slightly of roasted malt bit of a grainy odor  very faint odor  tastes like a generic light beer nothing remarkable about it faint flavor of hops and malt heavy seltzer taste  feels feels like seltzer water in the mouth  overall its a run of the mill light beer really nothing special about it it has fewer calories than other light beer so this might appeal to some easy to drink but not very flavorful
2194,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.06,bbd 28 dec 22  nitro version poured a velvety black color from a 149 oz can into a standard pint glass with a creamy finger high head that receded slowly and left curtain lacing that clung to the glass as it dissipated aroma is earthy and grainy which is fairly standard for the style taste is chocolate forward but is not overly chocolaty and has hints of chicory roasted malts  grain mouth is smooth medium bodied with a clean finish and is very drinkable picked up for under 10 for a 4 pack and was quite pleased wit the purchase
2195,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.61,very tasty beer thick not too heavy
2196,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.58,poured from a 112oz bottle dated 28 jul 22 to a diagonally cut tumbler at fridge temp but was slowly sipped and allowed to warm the body is opaque black with a short deep tan head on top that fades but provides some quickly disappearing lacing chocolate is dominant in the smell as is the alcohol some dried fruit can be sensed also the taste brings the dried fruit out more prominently cherrys raisins all chocolate covered this beer bridges between the sweet and the bitter overall the taste is reminiscent of a box full of a fruity alcohol chocolate sampler mouthfeel seems rather thin frankly but it does leave your lips sticky i am not quite sure about how i feel about this beer it was worth the experience but will not be a repeat purchase
2197,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.87,16oz nitro can into a pint glass best before 91922 so a couple weeks late on this one  looks superb in the glass jet black body cream colored creamy head which persists throughout leaving a layer of lacing  creamy aroma but smells a little off  on tasting not getting as much chocolate as i hoped but a sweet creamy stout with a light roast at the end for balance  mouth just about reaches medium finish roasty  overall some flaws in all categories except the look
2198,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.19,a bit surprised i had never reviewed this beer before  poured from a bottle into a tulip glass rich dark brown color with great beige head and nice curtain lacingsmell and taste of dark chocolate and roasted malt clean not overpowering taste rich smooth feel i wish i had another bottle
2199,Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.94,seeing the tape get pulled off the menu listing for the 2020 bottle at the cantillon bar definitely got the old heart pumping as the freshly horizontally uncorked bottle rested in its lambic basket it began to slowly push a soft mauve foam out of the spout before i gave it a tilt to pour a damn near smoothielike stream into the glass there it displays fully opaque garnet with a dense cotton candy head  i said st lam was the juiciest loon scratch that this is like schaerbeek puree with mild hints of cinnamon marzipan delivered on a pillowy body with a surprisingly balanced acidity even still a complex oak tannin brings us to a bone dry finish before exhaling a touch of black pepper and perhaps chevre a delicious candied quality further emerges as it warms  im not sure i ever imagined just what made lpk the highly coveted fruited lambic that it is but clearly that distinguisher is decadence this is undoubtedly the thickest lambic ive ever had and in all the most delicious ways
2200,Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.64,cradled 750ml bottle served in decanter sat for 20 minutes then served into glass pours a rich burgundy color with a finger of pink foam aroma is cherry forward but not in a fleshy fruit forward way instead delivering a rindy dark pit its morphs into notes of almond and cinnamon with light tart cherry and stone just beyond complexity is notable without any overtly sugary tendencies flavor profile delivers those same almond and cinnamon notes cherry is present with a tart twist stone followed by big lemon zest and grassy notes play the outro again the complexity and depth is just amazing for a beer blended with cherries it develops much more nuance and thought beyond this single note mouth feel is medium in thickness with a consistent grit throughout it verges on bubbly at least at the onset overall cherry notes here are just a delight swirling together with almond and cinnamon for a thought provoking sip it refrains from every dipping into overtly tart or sour  2018 served from a 750ml bottle decanted reviewed from notes
2201,Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.65,drank in the night of 31st december 2021 last beer of the year
2202,Imperial Stout Trooper,3.45,canned december 14 2017 with the bottom of the can stamped vulcans 4 life  oklets see how this 6 year old beer has held up appearance wise the answer is quite well stouts almost all look the same to me but thats not a bad thing deepest brown  black but what i was pleasantly surprised with was the thick beige head that showed good retention before settling into a permanent ring and cap  aroma is a nice blend of roast and sweetness cocoa roasted malts and vanillalike aromas nice smelling beer  taste is where the age of the beer is showing up i think time has likely stripped away what i imagine were a more congruous set of ingredients whats left is a little bit like bitter cocoa mixed into a thin base beer  overall this is not particularly enjoyable i will have to try it fresh certainly cant blame the brewer for the fact that this languished in my cellar for way too long
2203,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.27,pours a dark cola color and settles as black in the glass with a dense dark tan head the nose includes a nice amount of rich cocoa along with roasty char notes and a bit of stone fruit  the taste is amped up with that rich cocoa and roasty char syncing nicely with the dark cherry flavor to present a really flavorful imperial stout that improves as it warms  the mouthfeel is a bit thinner than id like to see with a beer of this magnitude still a very nice representation of the style that id gladly revisit again and again
2204,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.34,jet black body opaque thick frothy light tan head rich sweet aroma dark roasted grains cocoa and chocolate dark roast coffee the taste follows along with and amplifies the smell characteristics milk chocolate and coffee moderate bitterness throughout mild booziness heavy body smooth and glassy silky slight alcohol dryness offsetting the overall sweetness  a wonderful imperial stout that delivers a lot of sensory goods  pouring temperature 48 f canning data laugh it up fuzzball 110821
2205,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.8,great beer world class to be honest all malt does the job  roasted character big malty body bitter but sweet that roast malt bitterness a lot of espresso some mild chocolatey character its a great beer it harkens to the best of the all malt stuff out there and at a really good price point
2206,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.61,this is one of the best adjunk free stouts i have ever had the pleasure to drink poured black as the empires ill will with a medium brown short and dense head that left regular lacing smelled faint to my nose but thats normal what i did get was malty goodness the taste was excellent full and rich in depth of malts very little bitterness at all so good the feel ideally weighted for the style encourages a slow pace but begs for another sip oa really enjoyed this one if you can find it try it
2207,Imperial Stout Trooper,3.58,thanks to roguer for this one 12 oz can dated laugh it up fuzzball 11821 poured into 14oz teku poured a solid and dense black color with 34 inch of medium brown color that had very good retention and very light lacing  strong roast at the front of the nose yet it didnt border on coffee solid malts and a light bit of chocolate were behind the roast  similar on the tongue with the roast coming across a bit stronger and lingering on the finish  the body was fairly typical for the style smooth even and with a finish that started sweet but dried out nicely  drinkability was good especially on this wet rainy stormy late autumn day here in the pnw  overall a very well done example of the style would be in rotation if local to me a musttry if you see it
2208,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.17,112921 canned 1110 liked much better than the taste  neb roasted malt espresso nicely balanced not sweet or bitter go to stout
2209,Imperial Stout Trooper,3.96,its a very good stout rich dark heavy potent
2210,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.25,brew new england brewing co imperial stout trooper  intro 750 mil poured into a tulip glass shared with a friend  appearance pitch black opaque generous head and lacing that remained through the pour  smell rich malty aroma not cluttered by addjunks no barrel aging just grains and lots of them  taste followed aroma roasted grains maybe a hint of chocolate but no barrel no coconut no gummy bears just old school stout quite refreshing in todays time  mouthfeel medium mouthfeel leaves a slight film of aftertaste of the roasted grain  drink very enjoyable to have a change of pace from all the addjunks its a sipper one that will take a session to consume  conclusion i was very pleased to have the opportunity to try this one it ticked off a top stouts list and it also ticked off a connecticut beer on top of that it tasted great and didnt leave me feeling bloated definitely try it if you run across it
2211,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.47,500ml bottle bottled 122014  a pours jet black in color with a onefinger foamy khaki head that reduces to a ring around the edge  s bold roasted malt on the nose gives aromas of chocolate molasses rum soaked raisins stewed figs black licorice brownies and caramelized sugar even picking up some portlike aromas  t bold flavors of chocolate roasted barley figs dates and raisins to open midpalate gives notes of black strap molasses anise prunes black cherry and char the finish gives a hint of faded hops as well as dark chocolate roast and fig on the linger  m medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that turns into a thick and velvety slightly warming finish  o you just dont find very many great straight up riss these days this has held up remarkably well and is still better than most of the better riss available today
2212,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.09,poured from a can into a pint glass appearance  the beer pours a deep brown color with a small head of light brown head the head has a decent level of retention fading slowly over time and leaving a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass smell  the aroma of the brew is strong of a roasted malt and oaty smell mixed with some coffee and a bit of brown sugar along with these smells comes notes of fudge and cr√®me other light notes of brown bread and caramel are there as well giving a dark and roasty smell overall taste  the taste begins with a very roasty and toasty flavor mixed with lots of coffee and some nice oat flavors other flavors of toast and roast as well as some caramel and cocoa are there as well there is a bit of a brownie like flavor as well as some notes of nuttiness toward the end the sweetness and roastiness increase a bit leaving one with a rather dark and roasty taste to linger on the tongue mouthfeel  the body of the brew is thick and chewy with a moderate carbonation for the big rich flavors the feel is good and makes for a nice slow sipper overall  a decent oatmeal stout nice for a cooler fall day rich in flavor and very representative of the style
2213,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.15,from a can from beer of the month pours a thick dark brown with a sizeable head you can smell the roasted malt and the taste is even more dominant also a good bit of roasted chocolate a very flavorful beer i drank it side by side with a samuel smith oatmeal stout which is smoother with a vanilla sweetness but ipswich held its own  and was its own version of stout
2214,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,5,i gave a mixed review to a previous sample of this beer it turns out that was an improperlystored sample this is my updated rave review for ipswich oatmeal stout  this brew is black and viscous with an expansive lingering tan head  the aroma is rich and earthy something about the nose also makes me want to describe it as creamy  the texture of the brew is creamy too the carbonation level is perfect  the beer abounds in delicious semisweet chocolate flavors the finish is long with malt and hop flavors melding beautifully  this is a glorious beer with some of the richness of an imperial stout but more drinkability this is very possibly my favorite stout
2215,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4,i am trying this beer off the tapper at the brewery as part of the classic four sample flight it poured a dark opaque with nice tan cascading head that left a spotty lace the scent had subtle malt and roast notes the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink there was a subtle sweet roast and chocolate malt base with hints of coffee presence the mouthfeel was smooth in body with good carbonation overall it was a great beer
2216,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.25,reminded of this beer by the how many beers of fame have you reviewed post i did not realize that i had not review this brew before i have had this many times before looking forward to trying again
2217,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.18,pitch black appearance with a large mocha colored head and lots of lacing a real treat for the eyes charred malt aroma with notes of coffee smoke and bittersweet chocolate roasted malts rule the taste but sufficient hops help maintain a good balance smooth full bodied mouthfeel that is nicely carbonated dry bitter lingering finish very enjoyable
2218,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.02,very fine beer  pours a very nice deep deep brown almost black rich brown head  no noticeable smell  very smooth taste  full bodied and slightly sweet
2219,Clover,4.26,375ml waxed and capped bottle into torst stemware  pours a bright goldenrod color 05 finger foamy white head little lace with thin legs nose is juicy pear lemon zest peppercorn and a spritz and funky barnyard moderately aromatic beer opens lemon zest apricot pit with a slight touch of butter in the back funky towards the middle hints of bread yeast and peppercorn tart lemon seed in the finish lightly puckering aftertaste body is light with ample carbonation prickly and lively on the palate and goes down zesty dry with a long lingering aftertaste  great complexity though i wish id continued to wait a bit before opening this
2220,Clover,4.96,batch 3 bottle poured onsite at hill farmstead brewery in greensboro bend vt  this one pours a clear golden yellowish orange with a small head and lots of lacing  this smells like a sort of rustic oak thing lemon peel stone fruit white wine candied orange and a dry hay like quality  this is a blend of flora art and ann so its not surprising at all that this is really good having had all of those at this point i wouldnt say any one beer entirely stands out  this becomes its own thing that stands completely on its own and might be better than each of the three titans that contributed its very oaky and orangelike with a haylike dry finish that is just so refreshing theres also stone fruit white wine dried lemon peel with a restrained and very pleasant acidity  this is light bodied clean lightly and pleasantly tart and super drinkable  this is absolutely fantastic and might just crack the top 5 of hill farmstead beers that ive had  its just such a good and clearly deliberate blend
2221,Clover,4.7,bottle 2020 edition at hf brewery  white head with some lace clear golden color  such an excellent saison definitely has flavors of the base beers elegant is a great word for this beer drinks like a white wine maybe a chardonnay white grapes oak green apples faint saison spice wheat dry and bubbly smooth light easy drinking faint tartness nice citrus
2222,Clover,4.79,had at a mortalis share definitely one of those taste the country yellow beers tart crisp light not my style but come on nowthese bottles shares are amazeballs lots of oak dryness
2223,Clover,4.71,had b2 and b3 side by side this rating is for b2 which was better in just about every category than b3 b3 wasnt bad by any means but b2 was an amazing farmhouse ale saison
2224,Clover,4.74,clear yellowgold with minimal head formation dying to a clear bubbly and uneven surface that disperses to a bubbly flat collar the appearance was impressively identical between two different batches which we were fortunate enough to enjoy in one evening  starting with batch 2 the oak is very expressive yet gentle at the same time backed by reduced citrus juice characteristics like grapefruit orange and lemon this was a smaller pour than i had of batch 3 but the contrasts were stark while the more obscure parallels somehow held firm  out of batch 3 i perceive a larger presence of straw and young oak up front but this quickly gives way to more acid than b2 while yet remaining palatably balanced this acidity expresses like yellow raspberry and seedy passion fruit countered by a frothy body that exhales refined oak threads while that ann oak in conjunction with the subtle funk of art solidly affirm their support it was clear that floras return to the blend saw her influence well exerted here  this has been a very long time coming for me and contrary to most experiences with meeting your idols this did not let me down i came away preferring b3 though absent of overwhelming confidence as they were both phenomenal in different ways
2225,Clover,4.48,bottle conditioning since december 23 2020 so i believe batch 3  lemon  lime with soft oak  light earth vinous white wine notes lower carbonation
2226,Oktoberfest,3.2,in 2020 this was an excellent beer but not anymore better options are out there ayinger and devils backbone for example
2227,Oktoberfest,4.16,hello great lakes wow this was one gives a nice bold marzen punch right out of the gate mouthfeel is quite nice and juicy taste sticks around for awhile really a classic oktoberfest taste with this one i feel like if i was given multiple choice i could name this brewery with a blind taste test something about a great lakes beer that sticks out to me definitely satisfied with a purchase of this 6 pack i forget how much i enjoy oktoberfest beers
2228,Oktoberfest,4.22,12 oz bottle exp date 11123 into a dimple mug l pours rusty deep amber with a thin creamy off white head that goes down to edge foam light steady carbonation no lacing s caramelized malts raisins brown bread lightly floral a hint of alcohol with warming t bright over ripe citrus leafy a hint of grapes toasted grains lightly sweet  malty then rich caramel  citrus that linger fairly fruity with plum  skin slightly earthy with mild bitterness f bright and smooth mediumheavy mouthfeel with a robust middle and a long slightly dry finish o this beer stands out in the okto crowd due to its magnificent taste feel and finish feels a touch warming as well a perfect marzen for cool autumn weather it is outstanding in its style
2229,Oktoberfest,3.97,nice  drinking from the bottle so i cant see it or describe the head  i dont smell anything blame my nose  tastes roasty and malty with just a little hoppy bite on the back of the tongue  nice m√§rzen

2231,Oktoberfest,4.05,bottle from trader joes
2232,Oktoberfest,4.14,pours out of the bottle a crystal clear dark amber with minimal head the smells are wonderful that include toasty malt and maybe some carmel tastes follow the scents with some breadiness and spices only draw back was that it felt thin in terms of the mouthfeel but luckily i dont drink beer for that reason fantastic m√§rzen
2233,Oktoberfest,4.15,appearance deep and clean amber with a pleasing offwhite head and limited lace  nose warm toasty autumnal caramel and toffee very nice  taste rich sweet malty pretty big flavor punch here full of toasty malt and a slightly hopped zing at the finish a bigger flavor profile than traditional marzens and a surprisingly enjoyable and unique take on the style really liked
2234,Oktoberfest,4,pours a light opaque brown with a small head slightly sour and malty aroma not very much touch of sourness in the taste mildly sweet maltiness some caramel very little bitterness medium body a very good oktoberfest
2235,Oktoberfest,3.69,great lakes is a brewery that i am growing to appreciate more and more i have never been disappointed by any beer of theirs that i have sampled and their oktoberfest is no exception this is a marzen style beer that i would assume many us drinkers would associate with the oktoberfest style dark burnt orange in appearance this beer pours with a rather quickly subsiding head that doesnt leave much lacing the aroma offers caramel and roasted malt notes that are very inviting taste does not disappoint offering the same malt notes with a pleasant caramel undertone this is another quality offering from great lakes worth seeking out
2236,Heady Topper,4.96,for me this is the goat dont want to repeat what has already been said but it just has an unbelievable balance and a je ne sais quoi that is extremely satisfying to enjoy a beer that elevates the experience from a tasty beverage to something to transform the simple act of drinking into something more thought provoking also for me it is much more balanced than focal which some prefer cheers
2237,Heady Topper,4.52,poured from a 16 ounce can dated 73123 into a teku glass  look medium gold very hazy frothy white head above average head retention and lacing  smell pine resin clementine nectarine dank earthy medium strength of scent  taste pine resin clementine pithy pineapple herbaceous high strength of flavor  feel between medium and full body average carbonation highly creamy moderately bitter mildly mouth warming mildly dry finish  overall medium gold and very hazy with above average head retention and lacing bouquet was medium strength with notes of pine resin clementine nectarine and dankness flavor was a great mix of pine resin clementine pith and pineapple feel was between medium and full body mildly mouth warming and highly creamy overall this beer provided a great drinking experience and was much more of a mix between a west coast ipa and neipa than a true neipa from todays standards
2238,Heady Topper,4.76,l  hazy yellow golden with a frothy white head that sticks around leaving behind a good amount of lacing s  bright fresh piney resinous bitter floral hops malt and grass t  fresh piney resinous floral bitter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with malt and cracker notes along with grass as well as citrus  grapefruit  and apricot dank on the backend f  medium bodied with moderate carbonation crisp refreshing o  an incredibly well rounded imperial ipa
2239,Heady Topper,4.5,yeah ok its very good great hop flavor price point is a bit much but def worth the investment now and again so seek it out if you can find it and enjoy
2240,Heady Topper,4.37,i had a chance to visit the brewery and have heady topper on tap and bring a few home for a more in depth tasting  aside from knowing its fame i knew little else my first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as i expected secondly upon tasting i was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western ipa than an neipa not that its a bad thing im just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into most of my experience is with ny based neipas which do seem a bit different than vermont  smell  it seemed more floral than fruity the alcohol content also shone through a bit  taste  wow no ibu rating on can but this has to be 60 but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste the flavor really helps balance the bitterness the pine and resin was strong albeit weaker than some great west coast ipas i have had this was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify no massive grapefruit or citrus flavor i could identify maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description  the aftertaste was  dark damp and lasting in a great way to me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer the stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was  dark but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by  and i must say i loved the brewery beautiful and great staff i literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it my only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area the food options were not strong and it closes at 6pm another downside lol was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes i only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour
2241,Heady Topper,4.54,what i never rated heady topper great tude greater vt my sister brings this to me from vt a hazed golden standard with lace and last  tho brewer encourages us to drink from can which in a taste test turns out to be great advice s baked good floating an herbal piney floral sea t follows aroma through the full see saw of sweet and bitter woody earthy piney dank floral f smooth tongue kissy o deserves its pinnacle marks
2242,Heady Topper,4.8,the original beer is incredibly hoppy and flavorful strong dank tones this beer is good
2243,Munich Fest,3.99,an easy pour yielded a fat finger of creamy offwhite foam with average retention no lasting lacing clear golden straw body golden yellow in sun light fine rising bubbles support a lasting ring and cap  cracker and toasted wheat bread greets the nose with somewhat mild herbalfloral hops bread dough is noticeable with raisin and apple cider  neutral taste with above average bitterness herbal hop flavor is moderate overall bitterness is on the high side as in the smell there is malty bread wheat cracker and a faint apple cider tartness bitterness builds to above average white peppery with a hint of cajun spice semidry at the finishalmost crispbitterness last and lingers peppery and spicy  mediumlight bodied with lasting effervescent carbonation the ipa level bitterness takes away just a bit from the balance cant call this one smooth but close alcohol is hop hidden and it warms well jacks abby known for hoppy lagers went a little heavy for this style great looks and appropriate smell it doesnt quaff quite as well as most
2244,Munich Fest,3.99,sampled this as a sidebyside with the ja collab fest of both worlds  pours a clear straw color with a half finger of head the nose has modest notes of sweet maltiness and toasted bread the flavor has that slightly sweet nutty character that i like so much in this style the body is lighter that the fest of both worlds  id give this offering the slight nod over the collab but neither would crack my top tier for the style
2245,Munich Fest,3.95,16oz can into a pint glass canned 72523 so coming up on 2 months old  rich golden body but the head quickly disappears clean malty aroma quite sweet a faint suggestion of hop body is much thicker than you would think sweet and clean in the finish even a little warming
2246,Munich Fest,4,pours a nice clear light amber color with a nice head and lacing aroma has malt and hop hints taste has hop and malt flavors a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a good festbier
2247,Munich Fest,4.25,on tap pours a clear deep gold smell and taste feature toasty malts and spicy slightly floral hops a ton of flavor in a nicedrinking beer excellent
2248,Munich Fest,4.5,had this on tap at the source poured into a fest beer style stein pours a crystal clear orange yellow color with a medium bodied white colored head that left some lacing down the glass it smells of sweet toasted malts and a hint of hops tastes of sweet toasted malts and light hops its a very good munich style fest lager it was very fresh crisp clean perfect amount of carbonation excellent beer
2249,Munich Fest,4.03,pours clear orange gold in color with one quarter inch head taste is white bread toasted malt and floral hops medium light body medium low carbonation slightly sweet another exceptional lager from jacks certainly reminds me of the beer i had in munich
2250,Munich Fest,4.34,on tap at aurora brew works in east aurora ny  this one pours a clear straw yellow color with a small head and lots of lacing  this smells like biscuity malt spicy and floral hops toast and a light fruitiness  as expected this is quite nice its super clean and smooth with a wonderful lightly sweet toasted malt breadiness to it and a touch of slightly spicy and floral hop character  this is light bodied with a great drinkability and a refreshing crispness  i had been meaning to try this for a while and im glad i randomly came across it
2251,Munich Fest,4.21,pours a clear yellow straw color with visible carbonation a thumb length foam head shows great retention  the nose yields a malt forward sweetness this includes notes of honey and biscuity malt along with caramel there is also a touch of orchard fruit  sweet and doughy malt flavors evoke chewy biscuit toasted bread honey and caramel balanced with yeasty spices and a modest hops bitterness notes of grassy and earthy hops flavors and light touches of orchard fruit the finish adds a kick of crispness and is dry  medium bodied and moderately carbonated the mouthfeel combines soft malt smoothness with a crisp finish  another quality lager from jacks abby robustly flavored yet easy to drink
2252,Masala Mama,3.99,pours a clear ambergold with a legitimate amount of offwhite head leaves nice lacing aroma is a bold mix of caramel malt and piney hops flavor follows the nose malty up front with lots of bitterness in the finish feel is medium bodied a little light on the carbonation overall a fine ale
2253,Masala Mama,3.85,co2 version is an annoying combination of pine resin and caramel malt  cask version is creamy warm and mild  neither yanked my crank
2254,Masala Mama,4.21,this is no doubt an oldfashioned ipa strong on the malthoppiness side this is much better than their dortmunder beer i thought i bought a growler of each definitely a better than average ipa but not sure it is worth the extra trouble and cost
2255,Masala Mama,4.37,l copperauburn color with 1 finger of soapy foam that retains well some lacing s pine grapefruit some biscuitycarmel malt aromas t resinous with a chewy malt backbone grapefruit candied oranges cherry f medium body somewhat velvety good carbonation o crushed a 32 oz crowler of this easily and probably could have had more def my goto westmidwest ipa in the twin cities
2256,Masala Mama,3.93,cask pour at mthb cloudy medium amber with cap of thick creamy head aroma is light hops with some fruity overtones taste adds a layer of hops to the bready malt base subtle cask brings a nice creaminess to the brew but hard to believe this is a top 50 not impressed
2257,Masala Mama,4.29,cask at town hall brewery minneapolis mn  a the beer is crystal clear amber yellow in color and lacks visible carbonation it kind of looked like a beer on nitro when the waiter brought it to the table with the yellowish and amber colors settling down and mixing together it poured with a finger high white head that this excellent properties and consistently left a quarter finger high head covering the surface s light to moderate aromas of citrusy hops are present in the nose along with notes of floral hops t the taste follows the smell and has flavors of citrusy hops  orange and grapefruit stand out in particular  along with notes of floral hops and hints of herbs there is a light amount of bitterness m it feels very smooth and creamy on the mouthfeel and has a moderate amount of carbonation o im really glad that i had this beer from a cask as it was a pleasure to drink especially with the smooth and creamy mouthfeel  serving type cask
2258,Masala Mama,3.92,had on tap copper brown with a finger of white foam smell stars the hops in a bitter and herbal way with supporting caramel malt taste was pretty average with the hops truly starring but wasnt super memorable beyond the hops somewhat bready in feel with the hop textures interceding good ipa but nothing outstanding
2259,Red Fang,3.61,cosmic tiger edition light golden body sweeter malt has a good bit of bread and grain not particularly hoppy or balanced just a big sweet malty lager lighter medium bodied good carbonation finishes a bit dry and a touch perfumey  weekender edition clear golden body crisp crackery malt a touch of grainy malt sweetness more balanced than cosmic tiger mild floral bite smooth good crisp carbonation not anywhere near hoppy as czaf but would be a damn good aal if labeled so
2260,Red Fang,3.36,pours a crystal clear golden color quite effervescent initially with a thin weak sudsy white head the effervescence lightens as it sits but it remains somewhat effervescent throughout aroma has notes of sweet grain corn wonder bread with a light sweetness  taste is sweet with notes of corn grain wonder bread a subtle bitter hop note with some fusel alcohol like notes its pretty sweet with a malty sweetness that actually ends up lingering on the palate feel is smooth thicker and somewhat slick mild carboantion kind of dry on this finish  overall this is actually pretty decent  its sweet and grainy but actually tastes halfway decent i would actually willingly drink this again
2261,Red Fang,3.59,192 oz can from tavour clear golden pour small white head aroma is sweet grainy malts mild fruity flavors accent the smell slick slippery feel
2262,Red Fang,3.79,a the beer is crystal clear yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation it poured with a short white head that quickly died down leaving a narrow collar around the edge of glass s moderate aromas of sweet malts and notes of fusel alcohol are present in the nose t the taste follows the smell but the aromas and flavors are a bit more subdued m it feels just about mediumbodied and somewhat clean on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation o this beer is quite good for the style while it has some notes to hints of fusel alcohol these arent overly strong  serving type can
2263,Red Fang,3.68,192oz can into a pint glass canned 6121 so 5 weeks old  looks nice in the glass crystal clear golden body with good carbonation small bright white head doesnt last though hence no lacing  not much on the nose just a little sweet malt  on tasting very malty quite sweet a light dryness even faint heat from the relatively low abv  mouth right around medium finish sweet with the faintest of bitter notes but spoiled by a light metallic touch  overall not bad dont get to try this style too often so kudos to wayfinder for putting it out since i am an aging coot i have no idea who red fang are
2264,Red Fang,4,so here raul is drinking some malt liquor just after midday and you know i wouldnt have it any other way  anyway this one is pretty shocking  like santa tripping over the chord to the christmas tree and starting an electrical fire shocking yeah its wild and good like the groundhog who came out of the hole early i mean it simply just tastes good and thats good for raul cuz raul likes good things  see ya
2265,Red Fang,3.47,19oz can  pours a finger of dense white head into a rastal kolsch glass a little fizzy and it fades within a couple minutes initial lacing looks poor body is pale yellow crystal clear with a medium amount of bubbles coming up looks par for the course so far  nose is certainly a little sweet corn but some bready notes as well a touch of caramel not a lot going on but who could expect that not bad works for a weekender  flavor is pretty robust its been a long time since ive had an actual malt liquor but i cant imagine they usually have this much flavor that being said it also comes with an elevated sweetness and good amount of corn what malts are here do a nice job of keeping things on planet earth its a bit much at times but what malt liquor isnt  carbonation is medium body is quite thick for a lager sweetness is noticeable but not cloying bitterness is not evident at first comes out with time while it teeters on being a little too sweet it doesnt cross that line and the big body is a nice touch  drinkability is pretty good considering its not light at all mild alcohol comes out as it warms and that does slow me down a bit  appearance turned out poor no surprise there zero lacing  overall its not a beer i can say tastes high quality i mean its by definition full of adjuncts all things considered though its not bad pretty clean other than the sweetness
2266,Red Fang,3.59,can from abv  a clear straw yellow with a quickly receding white head this looks decent the nose is delicately sweet with a definite grain character no corn no hops the palate opens delicately sweet and grainy a clear malt flavor grainy mildly sugary and clean very mild bitterness on the finish with more sweetness present light but not watery crisp clean and quite drinkable
2267,Golden Eagle Beer,2.28,i had a bottle in an indian restaurant fizzy goldenyellowish white head that dissipated quickly  grainy smell and the taste pretty much followed the smell heavy malty taste up front without much finish no surprises  bottom line it was ok with my meal but got less and less appetizing as it warmed ill try not to order it again
2268,Golden Eagle Beer,2.79,turbid pale yellow with very little white head some splotches of lace smell is beer like taste is american macro style lager but without the clarity tastes slightly phenolic mouthfeel is light with modest carbonation finish lightly sweet overall with no year date this could be many years old lots of suspended particles i hope this beer doesnt attack my system tonight
2269,Golden Eagle Beer,3.09,bland ugly looking beer that had done separated sediment smell is cloying sweet of corn and honey taste is far better than the nose tastes of lemon and champagne are bright and zesty leaving a mild vinegar finish finishes crisp quite fascinating for an adjunct really hits the spot with spicy food
2270,Golden Eagle Beer,3,smells great it smells fruity but tastes a bit like a dilkuted sam adams pretty drinkable with some chicken tikka
2271,Golden Eagle Beer,3.81,golden eagle lager beer has a thick slightly offwhite head a clear very bubbly deep golden appearance and lots of thick lacing sticking to the sides of the glass when i swished the bottom and poured some yeast chunks were seen in the foam and the foam turned tan at the top the aroma is full pungent sweet malty and noticeable as soon as the cap is popped the flavor is really strange there is an overriding charcoal taste in the beer so it has a pronounced rauchbier character one will also pick up sweetness barley malt and hops but the smoke is overriding mouthfeel is light to medium and golden eagle lager beer finishes crisp refreshing and smoky overall even with the bizarre nature it is still quite good check it out for an unusual experience  rjt
2272,Orval Trappist Ale,4.6,bottled 07092022 best by 07092027 it poured a snifter full of cloudwhite foam but gave off a spice aroma as i practiced that virtue called patience as the foam went down and i could finally pour at least to the second pour line the scent was tart sour the taste was subtle with finessed flavors a sweetness back notes of pepper and hops all in a light mouthfeel the aftertaste was of ground cinnamon
2273,Orval Trappist Ale,4.43,it appears that this may be the highest rated brew of its style on beer advocate  the rating is well deserved as this is quite delicious  ill have to look back at other beers ive reviewed of the style to compare  im admittedly not blown away but darn it is good
2274,Orval Trappist Ale,4.03,smell is frankly almost nonexistent  not very aromatic some malt honey florals the body however is extremely tangy almost like drinking a sparkling water with a closely following body of heavy spice florals and honey its lightning in a bottle followed by ambrosia very unique very delicious
2275,Orval Trappist Ale,4.23,112 oz bottle poured into an appropriate glass bottled on 772022 and consumed on 7162023 so this has a year on it unknown aging conditions it was a recent find at a store started fridge temperature and slowly warmed to room temperature while drinking  look incredible head the beer is a hazy golden color with one of the thickest offwhite heads ive ever seen pouring this thing is a risky adventure with overflow a real possibility the head sticks around for a long time with tiny bubbles rising through the beer to keep it going long after youd expect it to fade minortomoderate lacing  smell exceptionally unique so much so that its hard to find appropriate words there is a definite medicinal aroma but oddly its not offputting a dry fruity character is present somewhat but not exactly reminiscent of cider a bit of lemon zest theres more but appropriate words are not coming to me many reviews mention bandaids in the aroma and while i understand where they are coming from i dont think this is quite an accurate description of the brett funk in this beer  taste so very dry as this first hits my mouth the dry medicinal quality is very upfront peppery spice without heat is also noticeable the ciderlike aroma shows up in the taste as well although theres none of the fruity sweetness you find in a cider theres a bitterness that reminds me of citrus fruit rinds the brett funk is present in a way that may or may not be enjoyable i change my mind on every sip but is hard to otherwise describe with mere words  feel exceptionally wellcarbonated i dont always like high amounts of carbonation but it works extremely well in this instance  overall as of my writing of this review this is the 1 ranked belgian pale ale its an exceptionally unique ale with one of the most interesting and complex flavor and aroma profiles ive ever encountered outside of barrelaged adjunct stouts the taste is so exceptionally dry im honestly not sure if i love or hate this i do know im going to pick up a few more bottles while they are still available in my area and probably run an aging experiment
2276,Orval Trappist Ale,4.23,7223 enjoying at home single bottle purchased at pig and fire  highly carbonated so poured a very airy foamy light head which dissipated rather quickly only slightly hazy golden in color  aromas of bubble gum mead floral and a slight root beer aroma thats coming through  very effervescent in the mouth ends with a slight bitterness flavors of banana bubble gum banana bread and vanilla ends with a lemony bitter finish and low and behold the taste of a fresh bandaid as noted by tsar_riga weird but its good not a super fan of the finish but really good overall
2277,Orval Trappist Ale,4.7,pours to a nice amber color with a fluffy head that drops quickly but then settles and stays smells of banana and is malty and slightly bitter when tasted smooth and silky mouthfeel and a really nice lingering finish that is so pleasant as the beer warms in the glass it just changes and opens up this is a very special beer
2278,Orval Trappist Ale,4.84,poured from a 330ml bottle   the look of this is a very red tinted brown  medium carbonation bubbles on the glass and a short lived large bubbled head that reduces to a tiny ring  almost no lacing  the smell is of yeast and apple  almost cider like  the taste follows on from the smell with highly prolific yeast that gets heavier as you drink  light apple malt and a pleasant bitterness  a slight hint of banana lingers the mouthfeel is thick  sparkling and dry on the finish  overall fantastic  this beer is something else 
2279,Orval Trappist Ale,4.42,poured from 112 oz bottle to a goblet glass looks a nice amberburnt orange color with a huge pillowy ivory head that is fed by very active carbonation bubbles throughout the body smell is earthy spicy a bit like a bourbon cocktail taste is subtle with a bit of malt spice pepper brett funk almost stale hop quality feel is light bodied well carbonated finish is dry overall this is excellent beer of course lots of complex flavor well constructed and very approachable
2280,Jai Alai IPA,3.99,95  ipa my ass  tastes like a mass produced burnt ale quite malty  not bad for the style but pretty terrible as an ipa
2281,Jai Alai IPA,3.85,really good easy to sink ipa pours opaque lemon gold good head medium lacing notes of lemon and grapefruit taste follows with minimal danknessreally enjoyable
2282,Jai Alai IPA,3.76,would love to try this super fresh but a solid legend nontheless
2283,Jai Alai IPA,3.32,smells nice nothing that blows me away but i know that i am cracking into a good ipa has a very citrus taste with a decent bitter and rosin flavor nothing that bites me away or particularly wows me but enjoyable on a nice hot day
2284,Jai Alai IPA,4.46,so i was an early adopter of ipas and have tasted tons of greats tons of meh but mostly a lot of unbalanced stuff  juicy ne west coast east coast missoula citrus guava pale over oak dryhopped lets just shove chia hops in a bottle and call it done  this is just nice very balanced not overly sugary alcohol is wellhidden and i dont feel like im drinking repurposed bongwater  this is a lovely wellbalanced experience  ps i have lived in fl for three years and avoided it like the plague mainly because i just want a decent refreshing lager
2285,Jai Alai IPA,4.24,this beer is super popular in florida and kind of put this brewery on the map its smooth and easy to drink good beer to snag at any local store in florida or out of state if you like ipas
2286,Jai Alai IPA,4.39,great beer especially if you can find it fresh outside of florida just picked up a 6 canned 15 days ago my second favorite ipa next to two hearted
2287,Jai Alai IPA,4.25,from a 12oz can  appearance clear yellowgold big head  smell citrusy pine citrus rind  taste on the sweet side to start grapefruit sweetened with a few spoonfuls of table sugar citrusy sweetness continues through the body the finish dries up a little with some orange and a little bitterness  overall finally got a 6 pack that wasnt old so i can do a review on the sweet side for a traditional ipa but less sweet than most of the new hazycloudy ipas i kind of like my oldschool ipas with a little sweetness so no problems here a good drinker but falls off when it is old
2288,Hoegaarden Citron,3.17,the foggy and very pale yellow body almost darkens to dull tan under an unevenly short ofwhite head  if i closed my eyes im not sure i could have told you that this wasnt leinys but for perhaps a little more of a wheat profile its just a soft wet blanket of sweet faintly malty lemonade through and through
2289,Hoegaarden Citron,1.55,250 ml bottle as hoegaarden citron thanks to tarjei abv is 30 very pale straw coloured slightly hazy big to moderate white head aroma of lemon and lime as expected also more unpleasant notes of rotting fruits and vomit the flavour is sugary sweet and citrussy without the zesty freshness i hoped for considering the beer had already had the misfortune of being diluted with this citrus stuff nope this is not a beer for me drainpour
2290,Hoegaarden Citron,4.5,a bottle at pub  grill argentina in brussels
2291,Hoegaarden Citron,2.8,colour light straw with a slight pink tinge cloudy foam white finebubble quickly reduces the aroma of raspberry lime somehow empty taste the first sip and the beginning of linden honey in a moment reappear sweet raspberry and lime this time synthetic very poorly and thin
2292,Hoegaarden Citron,3,q qw qwer we reqw wqe
2293,Icehouse Edge,1.75,the continued availability may be a local thing since i am in west virginias panhandle currently  24oz can best by november 2023  on the pour a big 4 finger head formed then quickly receded body is clear and yellow  aroma is boozy and nearly all acetaldehyde green apple nothing else  taste at first follows the aroma but quickly mellows out with a full and corny almost warm maltiness not too sweet for the style i guess  feel is full verging on thick and has a slight warming sensation long finish isnt terrible but it gets a bit intrusive like drinking a lot of whole milk but carbonated  overall i have no idea why they reintroduced this just drink stell reserve or regular icehouse depending on what youre going for
2294,Icehouse Edge,2.65,poured into a pilsner glass from a 24oz can purchased in order to review before availability disappears  look lots of large bubbles looks like a hive of bees  smell malty smells boozy and strong i think i can pick out some citrus and cracker  taste kinda wrong its a little malty but wrapped in caramel maybe even a nutty quality sweet  feel its got the big boozy body that you would expect from a malt liquor  overall this one is definitely better suited for the colder months its better than i remembered it being but still isnt great even by malt liquor standards im a big fan of standard icehouse this isnt it they both share the same kind of maltyness but this one is heavy on the caremel
2295,Icehouse Edge,1.26,ive had regular icehouse before and i knew that was one of the worst beers out there so being the masochist i am i thought to myself how much worse could icehouse edge be and here we are at 99 for a 24oz tall can my butthole quivers as i gag and shudder with each sip questioning where my life went wrong this is the obvious choice for a person lacking any moral compass which evidently there must be a staggering number of considering this stuff is stocked on the bottom shelf of gas stations from sea to shiny fing sea thank you miller for not just lowering the bar but completely dropping it on the floor in the process
2296,Icehouse Edge,2.45,its a party beer a cheap buzz set your expectations low and buzzed is the way youll go tastes bitter malty and cheap smells like stains nutsack but it gets you there
2297,Icehouse Edge,1.71,drank from the 24oz can sickly sweet with a harsh medicinal finish oddly thick and overcarbonated this is easily one of the worst beers i have had the displeasure of trying
2298,Icehouse Edge,1.62,24 oz can poured into san adams pint glass  look best attribute dark yellow straw colored would never know the beer is awful from looking at it  smell heres where things take a wrong turn smell is sweet and very fruity reminds me of the smell in a bottle return room at local grocery store  taste awful very sweet similar taste to a bottom of the tall plastic cup bud light served at a major league baseball stadium in 90 degree weather  feel the appearance of carbonation had me expecting a bubbly beer instead has a flat feel to it  overall gets a 2 simply based on the 8 abv and not awful appearance ive got 12 oz in the pint glass and rest of tall boy probably going in the sink  edit i did end up finishing the tall boy simply for the 8 tasted terrible review stands
2299,Icehouse Edge,2.74,yellowgold pour with moderate head scent is sweet mixed with malt and alcohol taste follows with the alcohol kicking in at the end light mouthfeel and a malty boozy aftertaste
2300,Icehouse Edge,3.78,icehouse edge is a decent high gravity lager especially for the basement price of 99 per 24 oz tallboy about 48 higher in abv compared to more traditional lagers if one is wanting a buzz or to be intoxicated less beer is required saving on carbs and the taste is palatable
2301,Icehouse Edge,4.36,holds its own against the so called  holy grail malt liquor steel reserve pretty smooth and cheap too get it if you can find it
2302,Icehouse Edge,3.29,the first time i tried this i didnt like it but if you drink more than one it will start to grow on you surprisingly amazingly it has a nice mouth feel and a decent aftertaste i cant rate it more than a 325 it just gives you a nice buzz quickly but be careful it will make you sleepy drink more than one and i promise it will grow on you and you will start to love it one of my favorite beers now
2303,Icehouse Edge,2.3,pours a mild gold hue with a huge frothy head into my glass metallic sweet corn in the nose with hardly anything else ditto for taste strong metallic overly sweet unreal finish which tastes like corn flakes in a bowl of water seriously theres at least one other high gravity lager that you can waste your couch change on its not this one
2304,New,1.82,375ml pulltab can from bottle mart port douglas australia  insipid with a cheap malt taste at its core 6row would be my guess and some odd vague breadinessdoughiness towards the finish in short its pretty bad but it isnt syrupy or watery so i suppose its drinkable in any case i reckon going off memory its the worst australian beer ive tried to date  d  not recommended
2305,New,1.44,terrible but a bit less terrible than crown lager not much else to really say its mega dry and seems to have been pasteurized for at least 1 year maybe more
2306,New,2.4,tooheys new the pride of new south wales another mainstream aussie adjunct lager its a nsw icon much like vb is to victoria xxxx queensland emu export to wa and west end to sa its not something ive had in a while as previously i found it too sweet for my liking but lets give it a fair crack  look standard aussie macro lager deep golden straw filtered highly carbonated head was non existent and has faded to a thin foam on top lots of cascading bubbles rising to the top standard stuff  smell wet grassy hops from the standard pride of ringwood hops which also gives a slight sour lemoncitrus nose pale malt sweetness smells like an aussie adjunct lager  taste heavy biscuit malt and grain flavour throughout the sip a tiny fizz of bitterness towards the end with a slight citrus twang pretty clean and smooth carbonation is heavy and takes over the flavour of the beer quickly  feel highly carbonated so refreshing when drunk ice cold its clean easy drinking especially if youre just after something to drink without thinking about complex flavours  overall its better than what i remember from my young adult days of drinking this stuff because it was one of the cheaper options on the market but its pretty bland to be honest theres not a lot going on flavour profile wise and the heavy carbonation does not assist in keeping the flavours around having said that you need to drink this ice cold  much like vb as once it warms up it starts to turn proper funky a decent enough lager to quaff quickly on a hot summers day
2307,New,2.91,pours pale golden with plenty of carbonation rising decent 1 finger head that has good lasting power  aroma of corn light malt and slightly bready  taste is of light malt corn and somewhat grassy rather sweet tastes better than expected expectations were low  mouthfeel is light body and lightly cleansing somewhat dry in the mouth  overall a decent hot weather beer maybe slightly better for the style than most still nothing to get too excited about
2308,New,3,gold in color with a half inch of off white covering the top the aroma is of corn and thats it im tasting some corn and light malt theres a trace of grassy hops the mouth is highly quaffable and thin
2309,New,3.25,from can pours amber with thin white head which fades away very quickly aroma of grain hops taste is some malts and a little hop bitterness not to bad
2310,New,1,horrible
2311,New,1.41,curious lack of any destinct flavor
2312,New,2.57,grainy this is worth a try
2313,Pure Hoppiness,3.93,canned 51121
2314,Pure Hoppiness,4.25,i get a lot of herby hops and just a little bready sweetness  bitterness and an herbal dankness dominate an extremely clean taste that only has a slight hint of malt  its really thin and has medium carbonation  the finishish is dry bitter and quick like john olivers wit  overall its a delightful clean and interesting ipa that i give a 51 out of 6
2315,Pure Hoppiness,4.33,poured out a clear golden amber with a barely sustainable head fresh citrus with orange peel some dank hop notes pucker upon first sip resin and a biting hop flavor lemon and grapefruit rind nice bitterness and okay carbonation great hop experience with this one
2316,Pure Hoppiness,4.21,this is a big classic west coast double ipa and its one of the best specimens of that species juicy piney and full bodied while achieving a dry finish  smells of huge hops but not one fruity flavor stands out usually doubles dont have as much hop scent due to all the maltiness but this thing is mega hoppeddry hopped big time i bet i get sweet malty orange spicy hops wow  on the tongue piney orange zest hops and cracker bread and toasted malts finishes fairly dry despite the thick wet feel it hits you with  its big its flavorful and its pretty amazing  i loved this review by a real pro and amend mine with it  by tracy hensley ljudges rating  overall impression 18  20  a consistent aroma blend of clean pine resin pineapple syrup freshly ripped mint and cracked black pepper lead the way in the front of the nose from 8 inches away tahitian vanilla bean pods baked whole wheat bread low sulfur notes and white grapelike fruitiness also appear the white head does not persist but does create a fine foam above a slightly hazy golden appearance flavors start as intense dank pine extract and continues into the aftertaste where it is accompanied by sweetened white bread which keeps the bitterness in check with a moderate throatcoating alcoholic warmth the second sip showcases tropical mango juice before pine again dominates as noticeable alcohol warmth and low motor oil elements come through full body and full fat creaminess coats the mouth and the mediumhigh carbonation and moderate hop mouthfeel close out the finish while alcohol tingles on the lips
2317,Hop Nosh IPA,4,12 oz cold can poured into a pint glass orangeish with a fine white foam laces well aroma of citrus and a little dankness taste matches with a welcome sweetness and a clean finish medium body medium carbonation overall a right fine every day west coast ipa
2318,Hop Nosh IPA,4.05,poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass no known birth date pours darkish yellow with good foamy head good mix of bitter hops with plenty of malt backing semidank good
2319,Hop Nosh IPA,3.99,uinta hop nosh ipa bottle a pours an amber body with small white head with nice retention and lacing s slight flower citrus rind smell pretty nice t nice citrusy earthy taste with subtle sweet toffee notes m medium bodied and smooth d nice feel and taste combo very good beer overall
2320,Hop Nosh IPA,4.03,based on my fairly unkind perception of hop noshs expression back in 2015 i find it absolutely necessary to delete my old review and reevaluate now as that opinion just does not apply anymore largely in terms of my own palate preferences and overall experiential evolution  lightly foggy orangeamberjust about as hazy as hazy nosh ironically enoughwith a moderately short offwhite head leaving substantial but fluid lacing that falls back down to the surface in slomo  a solid west coast ipa with plenty of citrus and pine working in concert its quite a bit more bitter and dank than their hazy obviously but without all that limey juiciness instead exhibiting some catty hints in the exhale however its quite clean up front and stunningly reminds me of the sort of prickly resins often found in fat heads stellar ipa program although paired with a lesser hint of dampening graham  the moderate body has a gently expanding carbonation and finishes just dry
2321,Hop Nosh IPA,4.25,great goto west coast ipa
2322,Hop Nosh IPA,4.15,poured from a 12 oz can into a sixpoint can glass  the beer pours a murky light copper color with a ton of floaties kind of surprised after reading so many reviews describing the color as a clear copper color about three fingers worth of rocky white head with substantial lacing  lots of citrus fruits in the aroma as well as some pineapple mango and papaya mildly bready and earthy malts balance out the hopiness  like the aroma the flavor is orange papaya mango with a nice bready toasty malt character great balance medium bodied and slick on the tounge a bit heavier than most ipas definitely a well balanced beer more in line with the east coast ipa style but with the big citrusy hop punch of a west coast ipa  overall a very good beer that i would would be happy to see on tap or on the shelf
2323,Hop Nosh IPA,3.91,12 oz can pours a clear copper color with a average off white head of large bubbles leaves some lacing in my glass fresh grapefruit and pine aromas hoppy citrus and pine flavors medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel finishes dry
2324,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.21,2019 bottle drank 73123  pours dark black zero carbonation strong pleasant aroma of chocolate and molasses taste is much of the same with an added hint of coffee and bourbon barrel feel is thin and flat which really distracts from this being a top ba stout for me overall its ok taste wise but maybe 4 years old was way to long to wait on this one
2325,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.4,lift bridge silhouette barrel aged imperial stout 2014 bottle number 239 750 ml 1 pint 94 fluid ounces alc 10 by volume aged in bourbon barrels brewed and bottled by lift bridge brewing company in stillwater mn usa the cold war is over serve at 5560 degrees i still dont know the key for that one i will skip the the gobbledygook until later  note this is one of those very rare occasions when i dont have a photo of the beer i consumed to go along with the notes i plugged in the ipod touch that use to take them and found nothing how is this possible its part of my regular routine i never forget to take the pictures could i have accidentally deleted them somehow thats even less likely perhaps i was just so excited to drink the beer that i forgot to take that essential early step in my ritual so once i realized there were no photos i fished the empty bottle out of the recycling and posed it next to the as yet unwashed glass i drank it from thats not even the true beer in there i followed silhouette with another bottle   i bought this two weeks ago at the brewery wish i had another to save and age and savor in the future but this is the one and im drinking it now id actually never even heard of this beer must have been sleeping or something when it was released last year   solid blackness in this one the darkest beer ive had from this brewery with a rich roast tan head that starts big slims down and stays awhile  aroma leaps out and spills the bourbon all over the place additional notes of charcoal molasses caramel toffee dark fruit vanilla always vanilla and i like it  taste ah mmm and yeah huh deepness and richness in abundance this has got everything it needs and it lasts and lasts immensely indulgent chocolate and espresso and everything dark and deep and delicious mmm ill say it again and what else licorice we call it anise sometimes and all those other things  its a thing of hugeness and a richness and wonderfully rewarding to the drinker this is all relative i am loving this and this is not a chore at all it is a delight if you want to read about a chore check my review of stones crime and punishment yikes talk about trial and error  hey lets read the gobbledygook silhouette is as deep and dark as the northern woods its brewed in the style of an imperial stout aromas of coffee chocolate molasses and prune meld with a unique dark roasted character  the beer is complex rich and full bodied its wild spirit will warm the senses illuminate the soul and grow into a traditional favoriteno matter what season
2326,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.45,2020 bottling 12 oz bottle  i walked on by this beer many times in the store because i considered it to be overpriced yeah i know its a 99 worldclass here but were suckers for a ba imperial stout  anyhow in a weak moment i did order one from my favorite curbside pickup store a while back and it sat in my fridge and sat until i finally moved it to the cellar to make room for other beers  its back in the refrigerator for cellaruary  so today is the day i wont be able to compare it to the beer fresh though since this is my first tasting of this beer  taken from a 42 refrigerator and allowed to warm for 30 minutes or so unopened drinking started at mid50s a guess  opaque black topped by a ¬Ω inch creamyappearing dark tan head with short retention little visible carbonation and what lacing does appear with a tip of the glass quickly slides back down into the tan ring the ring eventually disappears completely leaving a still surface  very strong aroma bourbon first then barrel molasses slight hint of vanilla  rich flavor mirroring the aroma bourbon oak vanilla sweet molasses adding to the party is roasted malts and dark fruits toward the finish and into the aftertaste dark chocolate appears along with the alcohol slightly warming my mouth in the after the finish is sweet vanilla and dark chocolate  the body is substantial approaching viscous but not quite getting there  overall this ba stout is excellent indeed a rich aroma and flavor a substantial body lots of bourbon and barrel without overpowering the underlying imperial stout flavors a sweet but controlled sweetness finish its not a dessert beer but an excellent evening sipping beer if im feeling like splurging i may actually buy it again
2327,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.53,review1600this thing is all barrel but thats not a bad thing in this case if i had to say something bad about it i would say it is sorta harsh and abrasive at times overpowering and this sounds dumb kinda too smooth at other times unbeerlike if that makes sense tastes like some sort of new better drink that supersedes beer into a more betterer territory
2328,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.35,pours black with leakage to mahogany brown on the edges and a tan head the nose has oaky boozy barrel notes some dark chocolate and stone fruit  the barrel is forward on the taste coasting into the dark chocolate and stone fruit notes which works really well the mouthfeel is full but just the slightest bit watery overall thought this is outstanding
2329,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.9,83 good stuff
2330,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.52,a slight fizz but then no head nearly black pours thick smell is a sweet molasses and caramel taste is smooth balanced not as complex as some but still extremely flavorful plum and molasses feel is outstanding creamy and silky smooth an excellent beer

2342,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.33,12 oz can ejby 081322 purchased cold single at shangys last week poured into a fat tulip  l clear tawnycolored liquid with perhaps a faint hop haze cratery exploded foam sponge upon pour collapsing quick into a thick gummy collar two droopy eyebrows of lace  s semicharacteristically stone melange of piney outdoorsy juice nectary hops along with a canesugar syrupy malty underbelly and moderately strident tonic ethanol kick upon further sniffage an herbal cannabis overtone all day supreme vibrancy if a bit indistinct in its aroma indentifiers  t bitterherbal pungent hops blasting the palate roof while a jammy citrusy hop and malt nectar permeates the palate floor with its airy boozeshocked essences the aftertaste is leavings of fruit and sugar sweetness with the peppery charge of biting bitterness still attacking the top even cutting through to the sinuses its almost like a malort and cointreauinfused strong amber ale  f resinous silken near cordial glory lithe and luxurious yet punishingly pungent its glassy ghostly undercurrent is perhaps along with its hot sauce fire its most striking characteristic as it seems to just float in the ether  o for all its brashness quintessentially stone in its relentless to me fantastic bitterness it sports jagged facets of twodimensional static obscure muddy expressions im somewhat enjoying this but craving something more characterful though its tactile sensations are leaving me perplexed and intrigued 1970
2343,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.85,deep gold with decent head it smells like alcohol and piney hops taste is bitter a little hot some malt  herbal piney with some fruit flavor poking through pretty strong and a little rough around the edges but not unbalanced and fairly easy to drink despite its profile it reminds me of the original hoptimum a little not a bad strong ale but ill file this in the been there done that and move on to other things cheers
2344,RuinTen Triple IPA,2.89,disappointingly long lasting bitter after taste with no sweetness at all  unusual for double digit abv reminds me a little of scotch ales with a strong dark almost metallic mouth feel followed by the bitterness a strong beer that unfortunately did not get better with a second can i like stone beers but this i wont buy again
2345,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.76,canned april 15th enjoy by august 13th 2022  pours a clear gold not much to talk aboot in the foam department  smells extremely hoppy but with a big malty bite citrus some pine leans into some tropical fruit but not hugely  huge citrus bitterness and the malty sweetness is almost as huge call it in balance i reckon alcohol is there in spades but it is not hard to deal with a little bit spicy earthy vegetal short sips are best for me  sticky somewhat juicy mouthfeel  kind of wearing on the palate but i enjoy it
2346,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.7,definitely awesome nose and color just has a bit of too much alcohol after taste to it at the end and bitterness lasts for ever
2347,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.31,so cool they decided to brew this beer again  look old gold body nice offwhite head  smell pine floral notes orange peel  taste intense grapefruit hopsalmost abrasive in a good way some sweet toffee malts midpalate fresh squeezed orange juice too clean citruslemon finish with slightest white pepper alcohol noteburn wow  feel very big beer fuller medium to full bodied ipa  overall this beer would be awesome to pair with food doesnt make sense to have more than one of these imo but this is an awesome west coast ipa the kind of ipa that got me into craft beer in the first placevery nostalgic and fun to try and a pretty reasonable price point to boot if i can find another fresh batch im definitely trying this again

2354,In Perpetuity,4.49,fantastic example of a ne style ipa look is standard hazy nice citrus aroma but the taste pops big time amazing combo of two of my favorite hops  citra and nelson these two combine for a citrus white winegrape juice taste but not too sweet the lower abv is a plus

2356,The Devil Made Me Do It!,3.62,a very solid porter with a great aroma flavor and feel does just about everything correctly but might be too heavy even for a porter

2363,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.36,pours a slightly cloudy deep dark amber coloration with a small fizzy head smells of slightly doughy caramelly malt and estery fruits with notes of red apple apricot and gooseberry as well as hints of hay spice funk and oak taste is a great balance of slightly doughy and caramelly malt and rich notes of estery fruit and lighter spice with notes of red apple apricot gooseberry clove and peppery spice as well as some musty funk and slightly tannic oak finished with a medium tartness and some estery fruit and spice as well as musty fubnk and oak lingering in the aftertaste smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbontion  while this stands on its own very well it certainly is by far the best value for money i ever encountered when it comes to gueuze although your mileage may vary i paid 4 for this 375ml bottle and honestly enjoyed it better than some more established and expensive examples of the style its a bit more maltforward than your average gueuze which is not a bad thing at all in my book while being quite funky with a certain musty leathery quality to it the esters are coming through nicely as well quite fruity with hints of spice while are also some tannic oaky accents to this overall this makes for a very nice quite funky and estery gueuze that feels rich and wellbalanced
2364,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),3.85,375ml bottle into a tulip 2014 vintage  looks okay in the glass dull burnt orange body on the hazy side brief bubbly head but this quickly dies out no lacing  no getting anything on the nose good or bad  on tasting all the elements are there a little funk sour faintly tart some bitterness underlying fruit however the combination is a little bias towards bitter sour  mouth between medium and full finish dry sour bitterness  overall had hoped for better there was some brownish goo around the cork so perhaps something was off
2365,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.79,displaying beautiful gradients of foggy amber under a dense khaki head that slowly settles to a persistent blanket and unevenly curled collar i can tell this pour at the renowned avenue pub of new orleans is going to be a wonderful one  delicious qualities of toasted sesame seed and oaky funk meet the dichotomously attractive attributes of skunky aged hops its just super fluffy just as the old lady described it developing a sort of peachgrapefruit note as i dig in further on as it warms we also detect a touch of pepper and golden raisin  the full fluffy yet airy body delicately glides to a semidry finish  i wish i had more time and room in my stomach for a few more of these
2366,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.34,a pours a golden orange copper color with 2 fingers of head that quickly fades down to a tight thin cap that has remarkably good retention  s a good bit of funk and tartness up front along with some fruity notes such as apple pear and white grape  t follows the nose starts off with a mix of funky tart notes fruit and wood a bit of some earthy mineral qualities as well finishes with lingering funk fruit and earth  m medium bodied with moderate tight carbonation  o a classic gueuze that lives up to the name definitely not the most funky or tart that ive had but it allows for the other qualities to shine a bit worth checking out if youre into the style
2367,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.03,375ml bottle 2020 on the cork no discernible date on the label poured into a tilquin gueze tumbler glass  the beer pours a hazy copper color amber hues with a few bubbles rising to the top of glass where a finger of offwhite head rests moderate retention with no significant lacing the aroma is nice pleasant funk earthy grassy lightly floral with a nice berry fruit quality and some pale grain and mineral water the flavors are nice lots of earthy funk grassy floral dry dead leaves mild barnyard qualities mineral water cereal grains and a nice bright fruit quality berries and tart pitted stone fruits the mouthfeel is good coating and very lively crisp medium body that has a nice heft and a tart and dry finish  verdict a nice gueuze from girardin lots of nice funk pleasantly tart and offering a complex spectrum of flavors
2368,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),3.85,rerate 750 ml green champagne bottle cardinal pub  bar stavanger abv is 5 deep golden to orange colour moderate white head sourer and even more complex flavour than noted upon first sample tart finish some bitterness original rating at copenhagen beer festival hazy golden colour sparkling decent aroma of brettanomyces sour fruit farmhouse horse blanket but not extreme the medium sour flavour has also the typical brettanomyces character but fairly well balanced and not too extreme should work well as a beginners gueuze
2369,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.32,when i popped the cork there was a nice bit of smoke clinging around the neck of the bottle it pours a nice apple color somewhat clear 1 12 finger slightly off white head the head retention is poor the head dissipates to a nice ring around the edge of the glass that rides up a bit on the edge no lacing otherwise theres some carbonation rising in the glass as i watch it the nose is a really wild and complex funky aroma theres a bit of apple here more of an apple cider aroma theres a farm aroma here  no not cow pies  like a strawhay aroma some floral aromas here as well taste  very wild up front it seems more into the funky floral that i was getting on the nose i also get some lemon flavor up front the apple cider seems to be a back flavor that lingers the body reminds me of champagne  really bubbly and crisp somewhat dry crisp feeling i do not have much experience with this style but i think this is a good representation for this style im enjoying it
2370,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.23,orange lightly veiled foam white good smell gueuze good gueuze good citric lemon taste very very satisfying tasting notes no great gueuze
2371,Mocha Wednesday,4.37,2021 vintage pours a dark brown with lots of flecks of ruby red as the light hits it pours rather thin with a fizzy cola head that disappears quickly bits of carb hitting the surface no lacingretention nose is roasted coffee beans molasses black licorice loose change baking chocolate very little barrel character at least initially kind of mindblowing these days to have a chocolate and coffee stout that doesnt lay it on thick with raw adjunct aromas while the coffee and chocolate are certainly there they feel like parts of a whole that developed together rather than some gunk thats thrown in and overpowers the product taste follows a similar vein  big coffee roasted coffee bean notes throughout the palate through its very long finish dark chocolate and dark fruit vanilla smoky wood salty black licorice and finally traces of warming spicy bourbon emerge as on the smell a really impressive use of the adjuncts here  not at all overpowering but still present throughout mouthfeel is the only real knock for me the feel is surprisingly thin and i think a little more body would be nice and even expected given the abv really worth seeking out
2372,Mocha Wednesday,4.45,2016 vintage poured from a brown wax topped bomber into a tree house tulip 194 abv  l lighter than expected pour medium to dark mahogany color with ruby highlights a thin fizzy offwhite head falls fast not much in the way of lacing  s rich and boozy booze bourbon and vanilla some oak cocoa and coffee mostly booze  tf sweet and rich boozy as expected at 194 deliciously complex cocoa and coffee mixed with oak roast and fudge the coffee and chocolate especially come through and are nicely complemented by the bourbon and vanilla a little thinner than expected medium bodied boozy but not as much as the 194 would make you think still very drinkable low carbonation coffeecocoa finish  o an outstanding overdone abv stout great barrel character and you get a lot of bourbon chocolate and coffee on this brew held up super well at 6 years in the cellar this is an allnight sipper of a beer
2373,Mocha Wednesday,4.49,750 ml bottle 2021 vintage bottled 102121 label says 191 abv served in a snifter the beer pours dark brownblack with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away kinda quickly but leaves a small bit of head small amount of lacing i like the aroma the brew smells like bourbon coffee vanilla cacao nibs and roasted malt taste is similar to the aroma but theres also the addition of some oak and fudge flavors noticeable too good amount of barrel character in both the taste and aroma mouthfeelbody is full its slick rich and a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation i thought this was a pretty good brew definitely worth picking up if youre into big barrel aged coffee stouts
2374,Mocha Wednesday,4.35,2021 edition coffee comes across as burnt hides the abv well tasty but not something id seek out again
2375,Amnesia IPA,2.79,pours copper amber clear with nice frothy foamy cap that quickly fades notes of metallic hops and pine sharp piney ipa with bitter hoppy after taste not for the nonipa or craft snobs an okay at best micro from indian wells with a 72 abv punch which is not written on the bottle not good could not finish  first time i have ever dumped most of my beer down the drain   update received the triple ipa version as a gift the 1pint 6 oz bottle tasted much better than their standard 72 standard ipa which tasted metallic and may have been skunked the triple has a huge hop forward 99 ibu and big bite at 99 abv okay local ca micro triple ipa tipa cheers to bold hoppy micro brews
2376,Amnesia IPA,2.35,comes in a mixture of yellow and orange with about a 23 head aroma didnt drop hops instead dropped an almost fusel amount of alcohol  the taste had bitterness and an exceptional amount of alcohol sting burn and bite its even acidic four different kinds of hops theyre lost in this alcohol bomb the carbonation on these varies wildly ive had them soft ive had them soda like
2377,Amnesia IPA,1.87,appearance moderately hazy amber body with a modest finebeaded white head which soon collapses to a dusting of white foam modest agitation say by gently tipping the glass produces a surge of foam at the glass walls the lacing is fine and glasscoating  aroma dark bread notes and malt dominate the aroma the hop presence is only slightly notable and has an herbal quality in all the aroma seems quite understated for the style  taste the taste begins with dark bready malts as the aroma would suggest as the taste progresses there is a moderate herbal hop presence with a level of restraint that i would expect to find in a pale ale later in the taste there are some citric hops finishes with a mild herbal bitterness  mouth feel soft but a bit thin with very mild carbonation  drinkabilitynotes an lackluster example of the style  presentation packaged in a twelveounce brown glass bottle with a pryoff crown served in a new belgium brewing chalice
2378,Amnesia IPA,1.74,just no this did not taste like an ipa at all off aroma followed by an almost non existent hop profile it basically tastes like a mediocre homebrew

2381,Insanity,4.3,12 oz bottle brewed on 111116 best before 111121 date consumed 04 feb 2023 glass snifter abv 111   look opaque chestnut brown crowned with a halffinger tan head the head settles to a ring of tan lace  aroma rich and sweet maltiness caramel toffee brown sugar stone fruits especially cherry noticeable notes of oak and bourbon whiskey vanilla the aforementioned cherry and brown sugar some coconut wood touch of baking spice  taste all of the notes from the aroma are here the caramel toffee and brown sugar and cherry darkblack cherry are more prominent in the taste than in the aroma as is the coconut though not as much the alcohol can be noticed and provides nice mild but warming burn which isnt surprising the sip finishes warm and semidry  feel creamy and a tad sticky there is a nice warmth from the alcohol the body is medium  overall a complex and enjoyable barleywine of the english persuasion this beer is drinking nicely at 625 years old and 125 years past its best by date and makes quite the nice winter time sipper
2382,Insanity,3.5,big carb for a barleywine poured it and retaining some head 123014 123019 date code on label poured seemed eh a little thin but lets get into this appreciated inside a rona 360 ml celebration wine glass  nose is bad mildewy leather cardboard taste is better pruney raisin thinner than id like leathery old flavor marginal barrel i guess this fucker is pretty old and perhaps past its prime assuming its a 2014 release so 8 years old in that case lets try to be nice prune raisin thin body decent sugars pretty nice so its not bad but its not that good i think youll need to take into account the extended age of this one assuming the body hasnt changed since inception id appreciate a slightly thicker feel but cant complain too much there is a noticeable viscosity 3910
2383,Insanity,4.24,caramel color with a 1f head the look is the only weaker aspect of the beer strong oak in the aroma very smooth mf especially for the style and very smooth the taste mirrors the aroma with some added fruit an excellent barleywine more balanced than bigfoot and other beers in the style
2384,Insanity,4.17,pours a nearly clear dark chestnut color with a small head and light lacing  smells of bourbon oak and dark fruit  tastes of sweet malt raisins caramel and vanilla with a warm boozy finish  medium heavy body with very light carbonation lush syrupy mouthfeel  this is one of the sweetest barleywines i have ever tasted
2385,Insanity,4.44,pours the most gorgeous brown color youve ever seen a little hazy with a light tan head that sticks around a bit absolutely beautiful beer the nose is rich with caramel and toffee notes and theres a nice oaky aroma from the barrel  and of course the stone fruit  the stone fruit is the key to this and the base beer blithering idiot i am literally salivating  the caramel and toffee flavors are forward on the taste as they should be and theres a delicious oaky flavor from the barrel which also provides a bit of alcohol heat which fits this big beer 133 abv perfectly but its that stone fruit that reels me in  the dark cherry flavor is the perfect complement to the aforementioned components i could drink gallons of this  the mouthfeel is substantial and a bit creamy i loved the base beer and i love this variant a smidge more
2386,Insanity,4.35,very oaky barrel good carbonation balanced between american and english style to my palate
2387,Insanity,4.41,aggressive pour yields more head with more staying power than anticipated a pretty solid ring of lace forms as it slowly recedes body is a murky doo doo water brown the label says that this was aged in oak barrels but its pretty clear from the smell wafting into my nostrils that those barrels once contained whisky and so too does this beer lots of it not picking up the usual barrel char notes that these bourbon barrel aged beers often lend this is just neat straightup whisky the base beer offers up some caramel notes and bitter hops and im getting rather excited that this is a proper barleywine and not just a triple ipa sips oh it is malty sweet caramel up front with drying whisky to balance things on the back end very very nice soft sugar daddy caramel lingers on the palette pretty well fullbodied with proper chew mild bittering i really like this one its a little cold left it in the fridge overnight but im going to sip slowly and let it warm to see if it opens up any hidden complexities something tells me it will
2388,Insanity,4.38,poured a 12 ounce bottle of undetermined date wtf weyerbacher into a lost abbey long stemmed tulip thick off white head over a clear brownish ruby color smell was muted at cellar temperature but eventually warmed up and reflected malty dark fruit notes and brown sugar taste reflected the smell but more immediate and intense mouthfeel was deceivingly light for an ale of this heft  for some reason again wtf weyerbacher with no data on the bottle i was expecting this to be an american style barleywine not having access to ba at the bottle shop or being too lazy to look it up so only bought a single its still not nearly as complex as jw lees harvest ale or thomas hardy but perhaps aging can help that maybe not but this is too good not to experiment with
2389,Insanity,4.85,excellent beer if you are a fan of bourbon you will enjoy the added whiskey dimension smooth little sweet but excellent
2390,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,2.39,poured from an undated 24oz can also does anybody actually know who owns this brand  on the pour a quite surprising 4 finger albiet quite fizzy white head that dissipates down to 2 fingers after a couple minutes color is your standard golden yellow straw and carbonation is fine but active some lacing  smell is generically cheap light and dominated by mistreated lager yeast not the most disgusting thing and honestly quite bright smelling but still not good by any means  taste is syrupy and odd diacetyl is present and the malt is intensely sweet and syrupy there is some actual barley present but its hiding in the very back slightly metallic as well  feel is mouth coating and weirdly flat maybe this is an old can but there is still carbonation maybe the liquid just chemically couldnt hold carbonation well medium long finish that i wish was shorter  this is a disgrace to market as a pilsner once g heileman moved out of la crosse and city brewing took over just figuring out who owns what and even what beer comes out of that brewery is a nightmare about the only good city brewing beer ive had was montucky cold snacks and that was just a decent lager this on the other hand is a cheap disgrace id rather drink colt 45 and to be honest with you the lost lake website says this is higher abv but im not sure if its a typo because the listed abv is the same as the ice version and it really seems like they just dont care
2391,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,3.38,i got a 24pck of this beer from the woodmans in la crosse wi whilst moving my daughter to school it poured a clear golden with no head and no lace the scent had grain notes the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with good biscuit like presence the mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation overall it is a good beer

2399,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,1.87,look  ok to be honest my rating of the look is not very objective i know this beer well yet i bought a 24 oz can for 115 nonetheless just to have a fresh take on the review but having had this before when i pour it out it looks kind of like they bottled the urine of a dehydrated 95 year old man  smell  trying to be a little objective here smells sweeter than id like lots of mixed in adjunct aromas a little bit of malt  taste  not the worst beer ive ever had but definitely on the low end it tastes kinda like an anxiety attack ok its not that bad the flavor on the initial draw into the mouth isnt that different from a macro american adjunct lager but the lingering flavors and aftertaste seem more like the metallic powder used to exacerbate the yeild of high explosives ok its not that bad  feel  light and watery  overall  yes i have been heavy handed in this review but do not let that scare you away from this beer this beer holds a special place in my heart it is what i call a party beer but not a frat party beer this is the kind of beer that the college guy in the studio apartment buys for a party because hes very poor yeah that was me its not great but it is serviceable when needed really its not that bad but im making this review based on comparison and by comparison this beer falls quite short of others on flavor and quality
2400,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,3.29,poured from a 24 oz can has a light golden color with a 12 inch head smell is of corn grains taste is malts corn grains a touch sweet very easy drinking feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is not a bad beer and at 125 for a 24 oz can its a good value as well

2403,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,3.5,
2404,Beck's Premier Light,2.9,first off i am not a fan of light beers but this doesnt really taste like other light beers true it doesnt have much color or body but compared to every other light beer i have sampled this beer hits it out of the park it actually has some flavor i have not tasted anything close to this that has only 64 calories plus it only has 23 alcohol perfect for hot summer days when you want to drink more than a few beers and still stay relatively sober given the low calorie and alcohol content this is a superior product  i think most reviewers are being somewhat unfair with their reviews if you lined up 10 other light beers along with this beer in a taste test this beer would stand alone as real beer flavor true if you did the same comparison with 10 other nonlight german style beers it would finish last but that would be unfair because this is a light beer  for what this is a low alcohol low calorie beer this is by far the best beer i have ever tasted
2405,Beck's Premier Light,1.65,its barely better than drinking carbonated water im on a diet so this is what ive got
2406,Beck's Premier Light,2.87,the scores reflect my company becks light to all other beers possible but really you would want to review it against other beers in its category light beer  pros  a lot of flavor for 64 calories against other super low calorie beers the difference in taste and feel is remarkable it is also filling like its calorie high original though it does this by being quite foamy the low alcohol content and filling quality of this beer means you can nurse them all night and not get drunk you can sober up nursing a six pack of these  cons  bloated from the fizz if you intent to get drunk by drinking this you might want to think again youd have to have a hearty ability to drink  overall i like this beer when i go to a poker party everyone wants to do shots and drink but they dont know im drinking a beer that will sober you up they assume its german and therefore must have lots of alcohol great beer if you are the dd you can nurse them and never get drunk
2407,Beck's Premier Light,1.92,i recently made a field trip our to subs  six packs on columbia avenue while running another errand i saw this in the cooler  when i realized that i had never heretofore reviewed it i seized upon the opportunity  from the bottle becks quality brewed under the german purity law of 1516  i popped the cap only to get a wafting odor of old noble hops and corn silage ugh i upended the bottle to get it over with  briefly got two fingers of fizzy foamy bonewhite head that quickly dissipated to wisps for my trouble color was palestraw srm  1 2 with nequality clarity nose smelled like saaz hops that had seen better days along with a corn malodor that did nothing for me ugh mouthfeel was thin  watery ugh the taste was just more watereddown aal corn  noble hops wasted in a brew that can only be intended for the uninitiated ugh finish left me with a good case of buyers regret ugh
2408,Beck's Premier Light,2.38,not all that bad for a light beer it still has a full flavor and body to it unlike most light beers so thats a plus a negative though is that it is super light on abv at 23 so youre gonna end up drinking a lot of them just to get a good buzz
2409,Keystone Ice,1.44,pounder can from the clearance aisle actually looks pretty good but looks can be deceiving and they are nasty musty pasty aroma wet paper smell taste does not improve things corny overly sweet flavors every time i go back for another sip it loses points the beautiful foamy head is the lone saving grace and that disappears pretty quickly hobo piss indeed and i thought nigeria pal was bad
2410,Keystone Ice,2,this is what one buys as a college student looking for a cheap buzz
2411,Keystone Ice,1.3,one of the worst beers ive had

2426,Yeti,4.44,i am putting this beer up with narwhal as a go to imperial stout surprised i had not reviewed previously a bargain as well six pack for about 15  poured from a can into a tulip glass oily deep dark brown color with an exquisite light brown creamy foamy head and excellent curtain lacing smell and taste of dark chocolate sweet plums and cinnamon some smokey malt and vanilla silky smooth feel i understand why this beer is a craft classic
2427,Yeti,4.29,black and impenetrable to light theres a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering three quarters of the top heavy soapy lacing theres plenty of dark lightly roasted lightly smoky and a touch chocolatey malt im tasting roasted barley and dark chocolate the mouth is thick and sticky
2428,Yeti,4.27,opaque black color with some ruby highlights and a massive milk chocolate colored head with some nice lacing the aroma is dark roast malt caramel toffee espresso and hints of dark chocolate the taste is dark sweet malt up front followed quickly by the bite of dark coffee dark chocolate and a blast of herbal hops this is almost taste overload massive malt sweetness backed up with serious bitterness from both the roasted malt and major hops the body is full good level of carbonation still smooth and drinkable but best for sipping after dinner or anytime you can just relax and enjoy something really appropriate to the name
2429,Yeti,4.51,the roastiest  stout ive ever tried sweetness up front gives way to awesome bitterness smells of nice bitter chocolate that definitely carries over to the taste i will definitely be searching this out again
2430,Yeti,4.4,poured from a 12oz can the color is pitch black moderate foamy tan head mild hop aroma with coffee hints flavor is quite hoppy reminds me of victorys storm king  nice dark chocolate flavor dry finish and thick mouthfeel im glad i finally got around to trying this
2431,Yeti,4.37,pint can poured into an avery snifter pours a deep brown with a fine tan head that lingers aroma is dark roast malt french roast coffee cacao powder taste follows chocolate dark coffee and a killer late hop bite full bodied low to medium carbonation overall one of my personal favorite american stouts well crafted travels well
2432,Yeti,4.9,great flavor not too bitter or too sweet and mouth feel
2433,Yeti,4.39,strong almost expresso bean flavor followed by dark  slightly bitter bakers chocolate mouth feel is pretty good a little syrupy compared to north coast old rasputin  but the flavor is very similar a bit of alcohol on the aftertaste that quicky gets overpowered by the coffee  chocolate flavor very solid imperial stout one of the best ones ive tried and ive tried a ton of them
2434,Yeti,3.87,12oz can poured into a teku glass look is nearly black with one finger of brown head retention is average leaving an island and collar smell is medium in strength i smell caramel semisweet chocolate a little ash or pipe tobacco and a light spicy hop smell taste is mediumhigh in strength i taste caramel dark roasted coffee a little semisweet chocolate a little ash and a long spicy mediumhigh bitter hop finish feel is just below mediumhigh in thickness its a little creamy carbonation is low astringency is just below medium its quite dry overall its a very good beer the mouth feel is a bit disappointing
2435,Yeti,4.13,poured from a 12 oz can dated 6072022 into a snifter glass l  pours a dark brown with a medium tan head that dissipates slowly s  smells of cocoa and coffee t  taste matches the smell lots of bakers chocolate and coffee f  full bodied and carbonation on the lighter side o  for an abv of 95  the booze is hidden well very tasty stout
2436,Yanjing 11¬∫ Premium,2.55,march 2006 330 ml green bottle with a green label simply called yanjing beer in france abv was 45 i presume this is the same beer pale golden colour large fluffy head grassy aroma not unlike tsingtao and heineken relatively dry pale lager flavour not offensive
2437,Yanjing 11¬∫ Premium,2.12,had this on board air china the crazy rice sweetness is overbearing and theres hardly any hops to balance that out super adjuncty smells ricey and sweet but overall just bland this is bad beer too sweet but on air china its free so i had 2 haha
2438,Yanjing 11¬∫ Premium,2.55,drafty grainy med dried mouth feel grainy citrusy pineapplely peel aftertaste on palate med dried yet crisp and grainycornish pie hoppy hint after taste grassy and subdued color is pale yellow foam is presence yet diminshing after a minute or 30 secs
2439,Yanjing 11¬∫ Premium,1.5,a pours clear golden with lots of small bubbles under the rather tall crystal white airy head disstipation takes some time and leaves nice lacings  s rice galore artificial sweetness bready some faint bitter hops but everything is very mild  t very mild taste ricesmoothness is the only thing that comes to mind  m light as water rich carbonation and no aftertaste  o if your game is getting drunk drinking water this might be something for you  otherwise dont bother
2440,Yanjing 11¬∫ Premium,3,drank straight from a 330ml green bottle  smells ok not to bothered  tastes light malty and hoppy quite watery and refreshing  overall a decent cheap beer great for drinking in enormous quantities not wanting to be snobby so what more did you expect
2441,Yanjing 11¬∫ Premium,2.53,coming in a 330ml can bb 24042012 served chilled in a stemmed lager glass  a coming in a dark straw colour with moderate carbonation without a substantial beer head s light maltiness with a doughy edge not assertive but the slightly sour note of lager beer is obvious at times reminiscent of prunes even t a gassy swallow of semisweet grainy malts precedes the lightly dry palate and a mysterious sour edge while an interesting perfumey touch of fruitiness lingers at the back as well its not particularly dry in the finish but pretty clean without bad influence from sickly sweetness either md the carbonation feels more lively on the tongue than meets the eye the body is thin but not totally without form all in all this lager beer is a watereddown version of german helles lager with added adjunct not horrible as bud or coors though
2442,Yanjing 11¬∫ Premium,1.75,big 600ml bottle from some hole on the alley in hong kong around a buck forty served in a tiny glass pours a thin yellow color with a nice head that disappears in about 3 seconds like a soda quick swirl produces nothing to smell so i pour again and smell fast smells a bit like urine and corn getting better lol taste is a bit of ginger and generic lager flavor but the ginger is at least semi interesting thin and not surprising not that great but the ginger was a surprise
2443,Yanjing 11¬∫ Premium,1.97,appearance light golden color less than a finger of foam on pouring lasted less than 3 seconds leaving nothing with which to lace  smell very sweet malty smell sugary cotton candy  taste okd musty taste wonder where all that sweetness went not here a touch of bitterness  mouthfeel light body crisp finish plenty of carbonation to scrub the palate  overall getting close to drainpour territory the taste is not appealing to me as with all my reviews glad i tried it if only to know not to buy it again
2444,Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.21,big wiff of coffee here like a very dark and robust roast heavily roasted malts here more roasted dark oats than oatmeal with some black chocolate and smoked ancho chili pepper in the mix thick yet carbonated very robust stout whose adjuncts are just as strong and bold as the stout character itself pretty good
2445,Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.59,on tap pies and pints morgantown wv  smoke coffee and vegetal aromas so rich and complex in around and then  a punch in the face of flavors and smokiness did i mention coffee almost syrupy in the mouth booze forward sweet maple and pecan come through as well

2447,Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.37,dark black stout with moderate head aroma is coffee and chocolate with a hint of alcohol mouthfeel is medium bodied but smooth taste is traditional stout with good notes of chocolate and coffee a nice smooth finish overall a very good beer

2459,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,heavenly brew after reading the rave reviews about beer for many years i finally spotted it at a discount grocery store what more can be said that hasnt already been said
2460,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,gods gift to earth an absolute must try beer no complaints at all
2461,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.84,the beer boasts an opaque lightorange color and a thick lasting snowwhite head the nose is wheaty and spicy with abundant phenols  notes of clove  banana carbonation is lively the palate is delicious and complex this is a supremely quaffable  refreshing ale
2462,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.65,one of the finest brews on earth it has stood the test of time full bodied and way smooth the hit of banana in the mouth coupled with clove on the nose makes for a complete sensory experience simply magnificient all around
2463,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.83,excellence beer silky bread and caramel notes
2464,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.58,a great wheat beer good year round tart and creamy
2465,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.55,hazy golden color with a beautiful head that lingers forever  the mouthfeel is so silky i would love stronger aroma and flavor it is definitely a delicate profile  a beautiful beer
2466,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,the rolls royce of beers there is nothing that comes to mind that can even compare at 54 alcohol you can hardly taste any grain the absolute go to beer if you can afford it in usa very expensive and hard to com by
2467,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,this is my favorite weiss bier the fact that it comes from a brewery that dates back to the 11th century is a nice little bonus it has the perfect balance of alcohol taste with that of wheat fresh baked bread and some banana its earthy yet refreshing  1010 a must try
2468,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.97,excellent tasting beer ive had a lot of german wheat beers but this is one of my favorite
2469,Juice Machine,3.61,i expected a lot out of this one due to the near legendary status afforded it it was unfortunately just ok  this one pours a hazy golden yellow color with a small head and lots of lacing  this has kind of a dry sharpness to it  with a muddled hop character that just doesnt pop anywhere as vibrantly as youd expect from tree house theres an odd little vegetal sweetness too  this is slightly creamy but not as drinkable as youd want  i have absolutely adored tree house lately but this was a bit of a misstep it wasnt horrible by any means but very forgettable
2470,Juice Machine,4.68,always feels good to untick that wants box no idea how it took so long to get around to this one but im enjoying it more than i even thought i would based on the th description one again just another nearideal version of the neipa style with such balance and smoothness it shouldnt be possible crazy
2471,Juice Machine,4,20230526 16oz can served in a goblettytulip glass can is dated 030223 got it from sulldaddy in nbs bif 17  pours murky yellowish amber small creamy head smell is juicy ripe tropical stuff  pineapple maybe mango smell rich taste is a bit of a departure from the smell  juiciness is still there but dominated by pithy bitterness strong bitter aftertaste  mouthfeel is smooth surprisingly clean  i expected something chewy and thick little bit of a chalkiness overall really nice beer
2472,Bleue (Blue),4.5,on tap at stk in disney springs goblet pour  im in a nighttime restaurant so its dark creamy off white cap lots of lacing  sweet malt lots of dark fruit raisins plums and figs  cream maple brown sugar and all of the dark fruit flavors  near full body smooth malt molasses and fermented fruits rich and alcoholic  so smooth that it tunes down the abv
2473,Bleue (Blue),5,only one word perfect highly recommend drink in chimay glass cup
2474,Bleue (Blue),5,i love belgian beers and this one is my favorite a pure masterclass on what a belgian beer should be rochefort 8 is close but chimay blue is the standard of excellence to me this style is slightly better than quads dubbels and trippels chimay blue is my goto for a tasty treat when im at good beer bars that carry it
2475,Bleue (Blue),4.74,so this review may not be wholly representative  2000 bottle of chimay blue plucked from the depths of cafe kulminator by leen  bottle is appropriately dusty and the cap is scratched but fully intact including the seal beneath  the beer pour a deep burgundy red almost impenetrable by the lighting here it js still clear and clean  the bottom of the bottle has a ring of sediment that goes unmoved even as the bottle is tilted past 90 degrees to the horizontal amazing  carbonation is still full but very soft a thin 13 head persisted until my first taste it can be regenerated with swirling  nose is that off a well aged beer lots of malt with a hint of wet basement light floral notes persist  this beer is amazingly smooth everything blends together well and theres bo hint of the abv malt and belgian yeast dominate this is from before the time when chimay changed out their fermenters  compared to a fresh bottle this is something else entirely they are related but distinctly different a testament to dirk and leens care and attention  there are few places that revere chimay like kulminator you would do well to visit and try some better yet come with a small group 3 and try a multidecade vertical  enjoy it while you can these bottles and bars are ever more limited
2476,Bleue (Blue),4.76,rubybrown fizzy yet creamy head great head retention sweet cherry candy fruity aroma some spice aroma toffee tobacco brown sugar molasses creamy somewhat heavy mouthfeel amazing complex beer
2477,Bleue (Blue),4.85,malty toasty roasty not too hoppy not too sweet but enough sweetness to balance the roasty malts 9 but not hot unbelievable complexity shifts flavors in the way only fermented foods can different notes come out with every sip dried fruit molasses bread chocolate honey spices graham crackers balsamic vinegar this is toptier for me
2478,Bleue (Blue),4.51,june 2023 hartwell always a solid beer
2479,Bleue (Blue),4.38,pours a deep dark brown with a 2 toasted marshmallow head that has serious retention and lacing nose is sweet raisin baked brown bread clove and baking spice toasted brown sugar and molasses apple cider gingerbread unlike many in the style the raisin notes isnt overly sweet or treacly but instead is very well balanced taste is similarly balanced  dark fruit prunes dark cherries pumpernickel bread and a surprising amount of earthy hop the hop element keeps things from becoming overly sweet and as a result its surprisingly drinkable at 9 there is a big alcohol kick on the palate but it isnt overwhelming finish is more hop keeping things pretty tannic and some grassiness mouthfeel is on the lighter side for the abv and with small champagnelike carbonation
2480,Bleue (Blue),3.83,poured from a bottle into a snifter bready aroma i like the flavor of this beer however the high carbonation mouthfeel is something im really not crazy about
2481,Bleue (Blue),4.04,330ml bottle in vientiane laos pours a dark brown with a medium foamy head aroma of dark fruits caramel malt floral taste of malts yeast plums strong alcohol notes with a bitter finish but not overpowering
2482,Kokanee,2.68,one of my favorites if i have to run with an aal though im not sure its any different from the bmcs and pabst is probably a bit better refreshing smooth clear drinkable pretty clean easy finish i tend to overrate this one because im usually sampling while on a raft or boat and the atmosphere adds to the enjoyment
2483,Kokanee,3.63,on tap at the wood in canmore alberta into a sasquatch kokanee glass  this one pours a clean golden yellow color with a small head and lots of lacing  this doesnt smell like a whole lot really  some grassiness and grain but that its  this is definitely better than any labatt that we get in the states and i had it on a beautiful patio facing the rocky mountains so it tasted great but thats mostly a situational thing its quite light with no real flaws to it but also no real distinct flavor notes to pull out other than the cold crispness the lack of flaws in a light massproduced lager is something to note though  this is crisp clean and very drinkable  i really liked this one but that is more because i was on a trip for banff national park and almost anything would have tasted pretty good
2484,Kokanee,2.84,the ab usa version purchased in oregon rated to style which i like and consumed straight from the bottle 1015 years ago the bc version had an incredible lightness of being that made up for its lack of flavor because it seemed to be brewed with helium kokanee had a truly unique feel back then this 12pack is likely brewed in fairfield ca and is a kinda interesting take on budweiser completely neutral on smell mild beer aftertaste after the carbonation fades its a lighter bud that omits some of the beery notes of budweiser but at the expense of the traces of complexity that still exist in the king of beers going down it has the same swallow tastemouthfeel of bud that reminds of jangling coins in your pocket if you like bud this is decent but its taste is an abbreviated onenote bud this could be bud the next generation at least its still in bottles and better than the current rolling rock
2485,Kokanee,2.75,one of the better pale lagers ive tried cereal in nature but smooth and mild and tastes really good surprised but pleasantly so cereal grains mainly in aroma and taste mouthfeel is light but not watery refreshing and easy to drink
2486,Kokanee,3.26,340ml bottle wow i havent had this one in about 20 years l crystal clear pale golden body fizzy white head fades to a thin layer of foam s light biscuity grain grassy hops t taste of nostalgia lightly toasted grain cereal grain honey mild grassy hops f light bodied moderate carbonation crisp and not overly sweet finish o to me a 4 and higher means id buy it againbased on nostalgic value this is easily a 4 for me
2487,Kokanee,2.57,the cans are excellent for shotguns unfortunately shotguns is what this beer is best for best served out the side of the can half a litre ice1
2488,Kokanee,2.82,six pack of pint cans picked up at total wine in bellevue washington no dating just a code served in a pint glass  look clear watery gold hay color a decent offwhite head that recedes quickly to a thin cap of foam almost no lacing moderate carbonation streams visible  smell corn and light cereal grain light grass no real hop aroma  taste same as the smell really watered down and mundane  feel light bodied with a decent somewhat crisp lightly corn sweet finish medium carbonation on the tongue  o i used to drink this years ago and its really gone down hill dont bother with this one waste of money
2489,Kokanee,2.53,we drink alot of this in canada and its a constant head of debate weither kokannee or bud light is better the honest truth is theyre both trash but theyre easy drinkin theres only one way to drink kokanee and thats ice fucking cold straight out of some ice and fast enough she dont warm up if you drive a lifted truck and you dont drink kokanee or bud light what are you even doing kokanee is the pepsi of the beer world and everyone knows it
2490,Kokanee,3.79,clear gold with three fingers of white head smell is fruity and grainy taste is grainy with some light hop bitterness mouthfeel is light with strong carbonation overall a tasty and light easy drinking lager
2491,Kokanee,2.89,clear golden body lively carbonation fair onefinger thick head sheets of foam left along the glass crackerlike aroma the taste mimics the aroma with some additional light hop presence a bit of metallic flavor at the end light body crisp with a hint of sweetness  a passable if definitely blas√© beer
2492,Kokanee,1.29,an absolute mess and travesty regardless of being canadian beer it goes down like water probably tastes better on tap if you can find it on tap there is absolutely no feel to this beer im extremely interested into how the hell this sells perhaps an acquired taste of garbage is required a disheveled beer that isnt worth anyones pallet
2493,Label Us Notorious - Calvados BA Big Poppa,4.14,l  pours pretty still in the glass even with aerated pour some congealed coconut fat in suspension s  coconut macaroon caramel vanilla apple brandy ceylon cinnamon marshmallow really nice and decadent t  largely follows the nose rich and as advertised f  chunks of coconut fat in suspension were no good otherwise a nice viscosity o  solid offering here probably worth the cost of entry at least once  83100
2494,Label Us Notorious - Calvados BA Big Poppa,4.53,3102019  apple to nose with hint of coconut silky mf smooth on palate well balanced with the vanilla
2495,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.44,poured very dark brown and capped with an ambitious light brown head that climbed three inches very quickly the aroma to my chemically damaged nose was mild but still featured proper porter smells roasted malts coffee a touch of chocolate the taste i grabbed the can again to verify but vanilla plays top position not sweet at all but no mistaking there is vanilla in here coffee shows up later this drinks true as it warmed the feel was good ideal even not sure if it could be better ideally viscous oa very happy to have been able to try this finally
2496,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.97,if youve ever wondered what could make a great porter even better it is notes of vanilla this beer has a rich coffee flavor and a satisfyingly vanilla aftertaste color is dark and consistency is very smooth its a shame i cant buy it in texas
2497,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.43,can pour dark as night with foamy khaki head leaving frostyfoamy lacing and a ring of bubbles nose is vanilla and coffee for days taste follows with some roasty malt and mild espresso bitterness vanilla lingers on the finish tasty
2498,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.21,2021 release from can poured from fridge temp pours black with a really good amount of light brown head sticks around for quite a while as well nose is incredible vanilla marshmallow coffee dark chocolate red licorice burnt toffee and a nice amount of dark fruit the taste nicely follows the nose but with a distinct bitterness on the back end vanilla and coffee very dark are dominant definitely some charred wood black licorice roasted malts almonds and tar not sweet at all mouthfeel is fairly thick overall a really nice coffee stout
2499,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.37,after being impressed by the high west ba version of this a few weeks ago i figured id give this a shot quite affordable at 3 for a single bottle given it currently sits at 323 of all time on this site  pours a very dark brown with just a finger of espresso colored head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing and decent legs  the aroma here is sweet but not overly so bringing a nice balance of vanilla hazelnut toast milk chocolate medium roast coffee and a slight dark fruit note  a bittersweet balance is maintained throughout the entire sip starting off with notes of cocoa powder lightly toasted malt raisin and a touch of grain alcohol the swallow makes this one a bit sweeter bringing notes of rich vanilla slightly astringent coffee milk chocolate and almond  a medium silky body pairs with gentle carbonation for a smooth slow sipper the finish is mostly dry due to the roasty character of the coffee  damn delicious beer right here it hits all the notes expected and doesnt feel overly sweet or strong despite the high abv id definitely get it again
2500,The Peach,4.34,never giving up on those childhood snacks de garde takes the influence of fruit rollup and rolls it into a winey earthy tart and spicy wild ale with lambic influences at the helm at well this fruit rollup is corked capped and ready for adulthood  pale gold and lightly of chrome the light and yeasty haze of the peach teems with bubbles while building a loose necklace of foam pulling from its white wine appearance the session kicks of with a plume of stone fruit over a citrusy tangy earthy briney perfume chocked full of both funk and fauna as its mild mannered sweetness greets the tongue the suggestions of communion wafer sourdough and a hint of tafffy gives a soft and wheaten buffer to start  as the malt sweetness bounces effortlessly from the palate the tastebuds soon carry the brunt of acidity that pangs away with lemon lime white grape crabapple yuzu and passionfruit with a stronger acidic twinge all the while the peach character gives a melonlike roundness for a smooth stone fruit taste nearly apricot mango and orangelike the bright and ripe peach flavor is radiant trending peppery with dry oak and lightly bittered hops hints of grapefruit grape seed and a mossy earthiness provide an earthy and peppery exit from the palate  light crisp and highly refreshing the offclean ale finishes briskly acidic with a series of short sourdough echoes laced with peppery white wine saddle leather and oak tannin
2501,The Peach,4,20221225 750ml cappedcorked bottle served in a pair of little cantillon stemmed glasses bottled 1021  pours clear light golden with a small ghost of a head that disappears and leaves a tiny ring around the glass smell is tart and funky a bit of wood some dry chardonnay something musty very interesting  taste is dry tart very chardonnay buttery peach  stonefruit notes are there but kind of drowned out by the woody  chardonnay notes tartness is somewhere between unripe peaches and lemons mustiness is some combination of the butter and wood notes i think  mouthfeel is medium to light super dry slight filminess gives a sense of liveliness that might just be prickly acidity overall its good and very interesting
2502,The Peach,4.37,cloudy yellowy orange body white cap settles into a collar quickly big peach nose big barnyard funk lesser so horse blanket funk oak more than the cognac support but both there slight floral notes too tart and somewhat earthy peach starts the taste before the dry and sharp funk massages the oak and light cognac into the peach apricot lemon green apple all support but finish doesnt elevate rather it goes somewhat acidic with a hint of balsamic vinegar feel is bright sour decently acidic cumulatively and funky almost feel more vinous on the finish very nice peach wild ale the 6th best no but still great on a cool summer afternoon on the porch
2503,The Peach,4.94,129 taste like peaches as advertised good stuff
2504,The Peach,4.5,holy peach love peaches in sours and this one is absolutely loaded with them pours and smells great and it tastes like a darn peach bomb unbelievable sour
2505,No Rules,4.44,black in color with no light penetration fingernail of brown around the rim and covering half of the top moderate soapy lacing i smell milk chocolate coconut and bourbon im tasting dark chocolate bourbon and coconut its deceptively silky smooth for the abv
2506,No Rules,4.53,yellow bowling ball i think means 2019 tried in january 2023 very boozy nose head was tan pour was darker than most porters but dont let that scare you  taste is chocolate with coconut on the backend while this is 15 it is a very smooth drinking beer well done
2507,No Rules,4.25,2021 on draft  pours a pitch black swirling gives way to thick oily alcohol legs almost like what you would get swirling a dram of bourbon not much head as expected for 15 but a pencil lead thin ring the color of hot chocolate sticks around for the entirety  nose is earthy sugarcane burnt brown sugar molasses toffee some cinnamon and vanilla  taste follows suit with the addition of barrel notes however subtle this doesnt drink like 15 very easy drinking oily smooth and full excellent example of the style and an over expression of what can be done with it glad to have finally tried it cheers
2508,No Rules,4.31,draught this is a 2019 vietnamese barrel aged version quite quite dark brown with a thin beige head no light transmission here sweet bourbon and molasses with some toasted coconut and toffee in the smell slightly syrupy malt toasted coconut and a bit of spiced toffee in the taste with a tiny bite that lingers awhile finish is a sweet dark malt and bourbon flavor
2509,No Rules,3.81,2016 bottle courtesy of johnnyhops age hasnt been kind to this brew will rate generously and rerate when able to try fresher
2510,Old Viscosity,3.84,pours black with a nice yeasty three finger head with lingering qualities aroma is roasted malt and coffee with a touch of chocolate taste is immediately coffee so much so that it likely overwhelms everything else some chocolate notes appear at the end however the overall effect is a coffee profile this unbalance is the undoing of this brew which is otherwise tasty moderately bodied and visually appealing
2511,Old Viscosity,4.3,i got vaccinated today figured i may as well have a brew picked a nice one too beer is black as night tan coloured head which quickly dissipates lovely aroma on this deep rich malt dark chocolate tobacco vanilla dark fruits caramel flavours much the same nice balance between dark malt flavours sweet milk chocolate and vanilla and bitter espresso oaky lightly nutty high levels of bitterness on the finish smokey malt flavours and sweet caramel flavours linger full bodied and light carbonation heavy really quite boozy lot of warming all in all very nice stuff just the beer i wanted really proper nice imperial stout
2512,Old Viscosity,4.1,a  pitch black pour with light caramel head floating on top and dense lacing  s  deep chocolate roast char and light smoke  t  chocolate roast and chocolate char from start to finish ends with a nice lingering chocolate roast bitterness  m  thick and velvety with a tad bit of thin around the edges dry on the back of the tongue with a slight chalky residue coating the mouth  o  an easy drinking imperial stout where the alcohol pokes through somewhat at the beginning but quickly subsides
2513,Old Viscosity,3.75,bottle i think its a 2015 but the date is smudged  tan head lace black color  roasted malts bitter dark chocolate coffee caramel not super thick but its a big stout lots of oak lots of bitterness from the chocolate and hops
2514,Old Viscosity,4.32,1 pt 6 fl oz bottle courtesy of cardinal pub  bar stavanger abv is 100 black colour dark ruby when held to the light huge tan head lovely aroma of moderately roasted malts mild coffee chocolate oak and leather full and rich flavour malty predominance with much the same elements as the aroma moderate but sufficient hops in the finish well balanced immensely pleasant to drink warming mouthfeel but the alcohol is otherwise well hidden in the flavour
2515,Old Viscosity,4.44,this is one of the beers that started my cellar maybe not the very first bottle but near it and not because i adored it and wanted to see how it aged indeed i had never even had it before but because i was loving port at the time and never had the occasion to break it out over the years that or i forgot and its been collecting dust ever since ive been doing one random cellar dark beer every thursday during quarantine for my own entertainment and i feel thankful to have pulled this one yesterday i cant find a date on the bottle but this has to be approaching ten years old its no newer than maybe seven years i do not totally recall its origin story lots has happened since then but suffice it to say it should be called ancient viscosity i dont always love how stouts age they often taste oxidized and thin to me especially ones that spent time in oak sometimes its just better to drink them close to fresh but i was rewarded for my patience with this one that is certain and the quality and refinement overall here is additional testament to how amazing port is with quality and attention to detail its immaculate close to jet black with a surprisingly high head mocha colored and frothy with great retention and even some lace unexpected in a beer this old and some obvious bottle conditioning has taken place this is velvet to drink i get notes of dark chocolate black licorice and unlit cigar in the nose and taste here with subtle bready yeast character earthy spice wet hearty oak and rich molasses just a bit of oxidation to the nose but absent from the flavor shocking for how old this is there is a nice decadence to this with it being quite dry for the style but i do get an almost belgian dark candy sugar taste in here all very well grounded and balanced nice roast smooth as anything and really seemingly pretty bulletproof in the cellar like even after about a decade its still nowhere near the end of its delicious trajectory i almost cant believe it i love older viscosity too but this is darn near just as good especially with all this age on it a stunning specimen
2516,Gose Gone Wild,4.47,22 oz bomber into a pilsner glass  so ive had this brew in my minifridge for years now like years id sampled it before i bought it and had asked my bottleshop friend if he had any more he didnt so i kinda horded it away anyway i figured it was now or never a brew with this low a gravity just cant age forever no matter how cold its maintained and generally speaking thats truth but in this case i seemed to have happened upon an anomaly  im drinking this beer as i type this and its as delicious as i remember it  golden strawyellow in appearance a sudsy head forms on an easy pour tart crisp grassy bouquet with subtle suggestions of unripe berries more sour on the palate than in the nose lemony nuances compliment the brews oaky dryness with bittering hops ushering in one of cleanest shortest finishes youll experience in a brew eminently refreshing now i might be regretting not leaving this thing in the fridge for another few years or so oh well
2517,Gose Gone Wild,4.5,this is a fun and interesting beer it has a lot of similarities to other stillwater sours like moneytree and hopvine bling the shell is very fruity with berries melon lemon and also some hay the taste is tart and refreshing i thought the brett would add more funk but it comes through with more fruity flavors there is a subtle hint of rustic barnyard in the background but you have to look for it overall very rewarding and delicious yb
2518,Gose Gone Wild,4.21,i got a late start on this past sundays nbs week 774  i did not finish up my delmarva  dc adventure as planned 8 further i have promised that next weeks nbs week 775 will be dedicated to the wonderful beers sent to me by jkblr who seems to have a real handle on my drinking habits cansparency is key in these things as a result i am going to cancentrate over the next few days on eradicating everything that would have canbined to form the finale of the delmarva  dc adventure sit down strap in  hang on its gonna be a wild ride  speaking of wild thanks to staying with bal  md i now have a leipzig gose as my next beer if this keeps up im going to get my status as a hophead in good standing revoked 8  from the can dryhopped sour wheat ale fermented with brettanomyces  i did some light incangitation before cracking open the vent on this one i wanted to ensure that any flocculation that may have taken place in the interim was now back in suspension following the crack i went with a hard aggro glug into the awaiting glass this led to the formation of just over a finger of fizzy foamy rocky bonewhite head with low retention quickly falling to wisps color was an ohsofaintlyhazy strawyellow srm   2  4 they must have gone light on the brett since although i could smell it i also got a really pleasant whiff of salt mmm i love the smell of salt mouthfeel was thintomedium not watery but not far removed either the taste had the funkified taste of brett but not in an overthetop way instead it was lightly tart not at all sour with a lemony saltiness that i really dug dang this was a recent purchase yesterday simply because i am immersed in stillwater artisanal beers at the moment  i am really digging it what a find finish was dry of course but not puckering or unpleasant as some have been yum ymmv
2519,Gose Gone Wild,3.98,1 pt 6 fl oz bottle served in a sour glass  this beer pours a brilliant pale yellow the head is fleeting and leaves no trace of its existence  the smell is tart citrus with some dank basement funk aroma  the taste follows the smell it starts with tart citrus funk is in the finish and aftertaste along with a citrus tang  it is nice to have a nice clean traditional version of this style instead of the trendy imperial fruit slushy versions this is very well crafted and quite refreshing
2520,Michelob Honey Lager,2.26,l not quite yelloworange almost a dark gold lots of clarity plenty of carb with a small head that keeps up a thin layer for a minute and leaves very light lacing s dust all kinds of grains and sweetness a little floral hops t very much the same sweetness at least isnt cloying though mingles with grains in the finish husky f obviously thin lots of carbonation but no depth of any kind body has no real balancing dryness to it o it is what it is some appreciation for beer would be nice of the brewers to employ
2521,Michelob Honey Lager,2.39,has a little bit of obscuring clarity particles going through it other than that it is in the solid yellow range with 15 white head the aroma did give off sweetness as its first and only component in the aroma department  taste keeps dropping sweetness too much out of balance not tasting the beercentric stuff just adjunct like sweetness lots of carbonation lacking malt hops yeast flavors nothing balanced about it despite the commercial hand job do they still make this it just doesnt resonate with me
2522,Michelob Honey Lager,4,
2523,Honker's Ale,3,deep copper orange in color head fades quickly leaving a bit of lacing there is not much to be found in the nose very subdued taste approximates what you would expect of the style but there was a very slight hint of smokiness in the aftertaste mouthfeel is smooth with understated carbonation this is a fairly inoffensive take on a style that is overlooked by many brewers not bad but not really anything to go out of your way for
2524,Honker's Ale,3.71,the first beer of my trip to chicago for riot fest honkers is one of those beers always spoken fondly of by old school bas and i figure theres no better way to start off the trip than with this beer i dont see in massachusetts lets dive in  pours a cloudy deep orange amber with 2 fingers of light tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  it doesnt have all that much presence in the nose but whats there is pretty good im picking up on aromas of biscuity malt floral hops lemon zest honey and light pepper  its a bit more expressive in taste but still not a punch in the face or anything on the front end of the sip im tasting herbal hops crackery malt honey orange zest and green tea the swallow brings notes of black tea floral hops biscuity malt honey toasted grain and light orange  a light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a crisp beer finishes mostly dry but a bit watery  this is nothing amazing but i wasnt expecting anything amazing this is a mediocre example of an old school style from a bygone era that being said its still a really enjoyable beer to drink despite its flaws
2525,Honker's Ale,3.03,liked it wouldnt b my go to but i can drink
2526,Honker's Ale,4.16,smooth drink
2527,Honker's Ale,3.59,the first esb i ever tried and i thought i hated the style until i tried fullers esb which is really great turns out the problem isnt the style it is that this is a mediocre tasting ale at best
2528,Honker's Ale,3.84,on draft at goose island clybourn 11521  reddish amber hues with thin white head dark malt and and some dark fruits on the nose sweet malt breadiness hint of fruits and mildy bitter taste its fairly light and easy on the palate this was my first goose island beer and i will always come back to it its a great sessionable esb
2529,Honker's Ale,3.77,was once one of my goto options in the days of independent goose island this was my standard bearer for esbs for some time the post abinbev offering isnt as appealing the most recent offerings seem to lack the maltiness and body i enjoyed previously the scores above reflect an average of prepost acquisition
2530,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,2.67,650 ml bottle b no350 mfg180512 purchased cold single two days ago at mr liquor  i could have sworn the label said 22 and not 12 for the mfg year only reason i got excited and decided to take a chance crazy the label looks brand new if youve never had 10year old basicstrength pale lager before youre in luck poured this into my hr tubinger mug darn near crystal clear mediumambercolored liquid good bit of foam on the pour but it collapses shortly after construct slightly grainy corny lead aroma with moderately heavy applecider overtone overall only mildly offputting from oxidation i suppose much of the scents carry over into the flavors notable dry vacuum midpalate devoid of depth again not terrible given its age fairly dry and quick on the palate with a slight residual slickness but little fizz to break it up surprised this wasnt a total disaster but i lasted about 78 sips before moving on more of this mightve went down had it been near freezing andor it was in the 90s 2072
2531,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,2.71,20150421 22oz bottle served in a shaker pint im shocked and horrified that the mfg date on the back is printed as 230812  pours clear pale golden with little head and moderate carbonation smell is sweet bready a tiny bit grassy a tiny bit lemony  taste is blandly sweet with slight grassy characteristics surprisingly not too bad just very very boring  mouthfeel is thin and watery overall not great but not as bad as i expected
2532,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,2.7,royal challenge shared at the 2014 rbwg  a rather run of the mill lager its strong point is the aroma which is a decent light malt with lightly spicy and floral aspects  on the weak side the light body is watery  the flavor is unremarkable for a mass produced pale lager
2533,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,1.62,well i gave this one the benefit of the doubt and poured it cold straight from the fridge with an aggressive pour and got a medium size white foamy head that quickly settled out and no lace color is a clear yellow with lots of huge bubble trails aroma is the best thing with the beer is sweet beerish hint of hop and malt flavor is sweet hint of malt  hop bitter and lots of carbonic tang body is ok but the carbonation is so harsh that it totally dominates finish is a little strange  its like flavor and is fairly short while leaving a neutral sweetness and alcohol warmth maybe the warmth is there due to the heavy carbonation enhancing the 5 into feeling stronger not very good stuff
2534,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,2.58,pours a clear straw yellow with a thick but not too persistent white head aroma is malty and just a bit fruity not very strong flavor is malty and palatable just a hint of apple  nothing to tweet but ok smooth texture has only average body and just a little fizz well india is not known as a great beer country  yet
2535,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,3.36,wow a lot of hate for this one honestly this isnt halfbad for a random international lager deep gold color definitely more visual appeal than most and it left lace rings on my glass too the nose is pretty pedestrian a bit on the sweet side tastes a hair sweet but not overbearing the hops leave a bit of an herbal note a little bit of a cereal grain character doesnt impart any major problems this isnt too bad really i had no problem downing the bomber of this at my local indian restaurant and i might even be tempted to order it again the next time im there much better than the usual flying horse old monk taj mahal etc not the greatest beer anywhere but id probably take one over a fair number of us macros too
2536,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,2.22,pours amber with a tiny head nose shows sweet light malt vegetables light floral notes and brown sugar very sweet tasting more cooked vegetables and cardboard practically no bitterness somewhat cloying carbonation is much too high body watery
2537,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,1.3,this is one brew ive never heard of and after tasting i hope i never do again it pours a see through straw hue with average carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head that quickly dissaptes and leaves no lacingthe smell is pretty horrible with hints of grains and weak grassy hopsit has a light bodied well carbonated macro mouthfeel and the only tastes i get are grainspale malts and weak grassy hops and overall to be honest this brew is definately one to avoid and hate to say it but no matter how good the indian food just go kingfisher instead
2538,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,2.85,served in a pokal glass from the 650ml bottle  when you go to an indian restaurant the beer you should get an indian beer that was the thought process that led me on valentines day to getting this beer while getting my girlfriends favorite type of food well as it turns out all of the indian beers on the menu were aal though i had never heard of most of them it was like throwing darts at a dart board trying to figure out which one to choose how can you turn down a beer called royal challenge  this beer pours a golden straw color faint white foam that didnt last very long the smell was sweet with aromas that included sweet corn and malted sugar the flavor when it was initially poured into a frosted glass from a cold bottle was a pleasant yet corn filled sweetness the unfortunate part is that i had to take down all 650ml by myself that meant that that the beer was sure to warm up when it was cold it was almost pleasantly sweet to drink as it warmed it became like drinking a watery corn syrup that was no longer pleasant to consume the mouthfeel was rather sticky the whole time which for a light beer wasnt as desirable as you might imagine this beer was only temporarily drinkable then it became pretty awful to drink it wasnt the worst indian beer i got to consume but there is still a long way for this country to go before it starts producing good beer
2539,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,5,my favorite go to beer
2540,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.3,well they basically watered down the old boston lager which didnt need any remastering in the first place it tastes like the old version except less of everything not as malty not as hoppy less of a cinnamon note just less i rate it compared to the old version so its rated a lot less they are obviously dumbing it down for the light beer drinker which is a pathetic thing to do
2541,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.69,sam adams boston lager new version draft at a restaurant dinner in august 2023 overall a good beer with dinner this is the newer version of sam adams it has a good head and lacing the body is a healthy amber flavor has a hint of roasted malt the aftertaste has a minor pleasant bitterness i cant directly compare to the old sam from memory the new one is more to my taste with a smoother flavor
2542,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.69,this is the remastered version drinking on the national day of massachusetts in my home state of massachusetts  12 oz can acclimated to 46f and poured into a pilsner glass  pours a somewhat hazy medium amber color with a 25 finger long lasting foamy white head leaving medium lacing  initial aroma is heavy on malt and yeast some spicy phenols coming out after agitating the year dominates the foreground with maybe a slightly caramely quality found hiding behind  initial taste before swallowing is a little bland yeasty with a definite dry floral spice after swallowing im met with a mild hop and malt bitterness slightly soapy and not dry malt is not just bitter presenting caramely and very bready some grainy taste to it  mouthfeel is frothy due in what i suspect is in large part due to the satisfying carbonation additionally a little choppy or rough but not at all bad its a lager and it feels like one  overall its a solid beer not trying to be anything its not excellent if you want just a lager  likely to buy for the national day of boston and massachusetts once a year but not otherwise i dont remember how much a single was but i doubt it was cheap enough to make me reconsider sorry sam adams
2543,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.27,its unfortunate that they felt the need to change this beer as i found it nicely refreshing before is it more refreshing now maybe but i dont think it tastes as good there is a lack of the expected caramel notes and its a bit too high on the hops and carb for me still better than aot of macro options though
2544,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.32,anytime you set a standard you are entitled to change that standard boston lager wants to compete in a bigger market and tweaked their formula that didnt immediately make it a terrible beer its a little more hoppy a tad sweeter a little more approachable if my airport restaurant choices are bud light or boston lager well
2545,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,1.72,boston lager was the beer that made me actually appreciate my drink before that i would drink anything but once i tasted boston lager something was different and wonderful now its remastered and its absolutely ruined its still better than some im sure but i wont be buying any more
2546,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,2.74,wow i know todd is old enough to be familiar with the new coke debacle no need to say anything else after well over 30 years of drinking and touting sam adams lager im finished very disappointing especially since current craze for hops will be a relatively shortlived trend incidentally best sa beer for my money was boston ale on tap
2547,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3,epic fail i miss the caramel notes and the tettnanger hops that typified this beer wont be purchasing this in the future
2548,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,1.12,why destroy this beer i understand that at 50 i am no longer in the hip demographic but i came to know better beer in my youth through this beverage bearded chubby 35 year old dudes that wear their t shirts a size to small have plenty of options you could have left one for the resttastes like a hoppy yuengling
2549,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,1.8,about 35 years ago sa was my first experience with a craft beer after years of drinking michelob and national im hi is aaron available for sean i have a question to you is sean davies still here and he is still there is he available that would be great ill take sean thank you byebye show me the other guy is premium i really loved sa for many years but moved on to true craft brews last week at a family get together they offered sa i was anxious to taste this again but was shocked at what swill this had become the beer looked thin and tasted of cereal grains thought i had time traveled back to michelob days really hope they dont completely destroy dogfish head
2550,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.5,i havent had the non nerfed version of samuel adam boston lager since around 2008 so its hard for me to compare the original with the cost cutting opps i meant remastered version but it tastes mostly like i remembered maybe a bit more watery now though its a mighty fine beer that ive kind of been craving more of lately i just wish since its now beer flavored seltzer water that theyd slash the price a tad bit  style vienna lager  tapcanbottle bottle  abv 5  rating 35
2551,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3,this is like the new coke or the star wars specialized edition all over again why in the world would you mess with the original recipe that is the flagship for your brand the remastered sam adams is ok i dont hate it but i definitely preferred the original if you want to come out with a new flavor then come out with a new flavor leave the original as is  with that said the remastered version is dryer a bit hoppier less sweet and less malty the carbonation is about the same the mouthfeel is a bit thinner  i probably wont be buying the new sam adams anymore as there are superior options available
2552,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,2.31,the remaster should be demastered the rich creamy amber of old has been replaced with a more bitter and dry lite esb im halfway through my 1st 12 pack wondering if i can make it to the end  update solution add lime
2553,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,1.66,why change a great beer it now tastes like an ipa i poured the last half out i signed up for this site just to leave a review

2567,Black Gold,4.53,not getting much bourbon but the barrel wood is really coming through at first it seemed a tad bitter or tannic but ten minutes or so of breathing mellowed that very easy to drink solid all around thirty minutes out theres more sweetness and a bit more bourbon vibe the base stout is for lack of better description and palate a savory type not sweet or chocolatey buy it if you see it
2568,Black Gold,3.82,i dont get any bourbon barrel character whatsoever extremely roasty character

2571,Furious,4.1,clear copper with a foamy head that falls into craters nose and taste generically remind me of a hoppy amber ale with a bit of melanoidin and some metal that metallic not is something i often get in amber ales especially with a dose of piney hops which furious has a bunch of its evident in the first sip late and moves forward with each sip the beer overall is a fairly straightforward american bitter beer with a bit of a malt backbone

2575,Bard's Gold,3.35,date 21621 i am not seeking a glutenfree beer however having a family member who cannot drink beer because of gluten having produced sorghum from sugar cane in a previous job and knowing that sorghum has a smell and viscosity similar to canned malt from previous brews this beer piqued my interest when pouring from the can i was surprised by the light color since sorghum has a dark amber hue i was disappointed with the head which quickly disappeared apparently a trait of maltfree beverages i began to think i was drinking a budlight i was wrong the smell had a hint of sorghum nothing powerful since there was no head to capture it the taste was subtle but having a palate for ipas this is what i expected first sip to last i enjoyed this beer the second can was as good as the first i imagine i would enjoy it more on a warm summer day after cutting the lawn
2576,Bard's Gold,5,tonight i had my first bards gold and i am pleasantly surprised my first thought is this is exactly what michelob light or bud light should taste like and if i remember both beers used to taste better but now taste like water especially bud light it had a nice bold taste good flavor and sits well with my dinner this is a new beer at my liquor store and ill be buying it again
2577,Bard's Gold,1.56,date march 28 2020 occasion two weeks into the covid19 quarantine still mostly glutenfree i measure a beer shared by my coors lightloving friend billy glassware 22oz pilsner pours a tawny sallow champagnetinged body with active effervescence its head does the usual maltfree disappearing act though its bubbles continue to rise and disperse at the weight of air really not appealing in this light immediate sorghum hard fruits like apple banana and pear candied sugars cosmetic counter perfume overload and a base solvency nothing really alluring here unless you dig cider or sorghum its first sip is dry thin nearly lifeless watery and without fanfare a late bubble in the throat may suggest its intentions but it doesnt muster much beyond a thin rinse i turn to billy and his reaction suggest coors light has not been approximated the flavor is constantly ebbing with faint hints of berry apple sorghum cheerio and bubblegum fluttering in and out of the picture elusively if not frustratingly so its singular profile doesnt leave much else to say so i end with a simple disclaimer if you have already enjoyed malted beer in any form theres no need to dance with this one if you are a celiac sufferer maybe these will grow on you all the same cider might be a better option
2578,Bard's Gold,2.55,the smell reminds me of a gluten beer i had many years ago but really cant put my finger on it  an amber ale or an english or epic pale ale the mouthfeel and actual taste are not very beerlike overall candy syrup possibly molasses but not much flavour the telltale sorghum astringency is there which slowly builds up as i drink youd probably get used to this overall if you drank it a lot  for a sorghum beer the sorghum is pretty well masked drinking multiple beers in a single session is the real test but not sure ill be up for the challenge this is probably preferable to cider but overall feels like a weird soft drink as i live in australia i had to buy a whole box to get my hands on this hmm
2579,Bard's Gold,2.01,well as other reviewers have stated it just doesnt taste like beer how do you make beer without wheat barley rye or oats obviously you cant if this is the only answer not my cup of tea or beer
2580,Bard's Gold,4.42,i recently tasted bards gold a lager im an avid beer drinker and have been trying to reduce the amount of gluten in my diet so i did a taste test of all the glutenfree beers on the market bards was the best of the lot it is important to note that many of the competitors in the gluten free space are not truly glutenfreethey have warning labels that say they have been brewed to remove glutenafter a bit of research it appears that these beers use an enzyme to break down the gluten protein so the gluten cant be found in a testbut the gluten parts are still in the beer i dont fully understand the science but if there are parts of gluten present it seems like misrepresented marketing to me bards is made with malted sorghum which doesnt contain gluten and not wheat or barley which contain gluten like many beers looks like ab has a glutenfree sorghum beer too but it is made with a syrup and not the malted grainwe all know how important malting is to the beers taste  my body feels so much healthier as i eliminate and reduce the gluten in my diet and am glad that i found bards im looking forward to drinking more bards in the near future
2581,Bard's Gold,4.06,bards gold  bards tale beer company poured from the bottle into a pint glass this beer has a two finger thick head with spotty lacing and a goldishcopper body  smells like hearty grains actually  it has a decent lager flavor but i can tell something is missing  the mouthfeel is light with medium carbonation  overall ill rate bards gold  bards tale beer company with a solid 4
2582,Bard's Gold,1.48,this beer has a funky taste to it its bland and what flavor is there isnt very enjoyable theres better glutenfree beers out there than this stuff
2583,Bard's Gold,4.08,bards gold brewed by bards tale beer company with an abv of 460 this brew brew pours out a nice brown color with a small white head the head to this brew is small and goes away fast i really like the color of this brew  the smell of bards gold is rich with sweetness you pick up on roasted grians and malts there is also a hit of hops in the smell of this brew the smell of this brew is really inviting now for the taste it is nice with flavors and sweetness there are mild notes of grins and malts i really like how smooth this brew goes down now  bards gold  has a real nice balance to it there is nothing overpowering about this brew i like how this brew ends with the sweetness this is a fine drinking brew the mouthfeel of bards gold is rich clean smooth and refreshing i cant get over how smooth this brew is overall im going bards gold a 4 out of 5 i thought this brew would be a bit more bolder however it is a nice drinking brew i would buy this brew again bards tale beer company did a nice job with this one
2584,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.15,pretty decent beer
2585,Michelob Ultra Amber,2.75,12oz stubby bottle  review from notes  i had a friend give me this one thanks janoy this is better than any other michelob ive had which isnt saying much but this is decent like a very watered down brown ale or a slightly watered down amber  its aight
2586,Michelob Ultra Amber,5,best tasting beer ive ever drank in my 40 years of being of legal drinking age
2587,Michelob Ultra Amber,1.87,pours a slightly darker yellow than the original michelob i wouldnt call it amber has a thin white head that leaves the glass quickly smells like the inside of a glass bottle with just the faintest amount of grains on the tailend taste follows the nose the only reason im giving this beer a 2 on taste is because you know what youre getting into when you buy ultra youre looking for a lower calorie brew ultras provide you with one lightbodied high carbonation smooth extremely crushable
2588,Michelob Ultra Amber,2.85,rates just a touch above halfway between below average and average for a low calorie brew its drinkable light brown color with small head light smell of malt which transfers to the taste which is a bit watered down light mouthfeel and light malty aftertaste
2589,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.25,nothing wrong with this compared with other light beers its fine
2590,Michelob Ultra Amber,2.61,look dull brown no character it is clear though smell mineral water taste mineral water very little of anything not sure what the point of making an amber version that tastes the same as the regular ultra comical overall skip it just get the regular ultra if thats what gets you off this is just a gimmick
2591,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.82,first i see this beer was added back in 2006 why have i never seen or heard of ultra amber until 2019 so this beer is a watery brown ale basically its taste is pleasant and nothing offputting at all easy to drink i have no problems with this beer at all
2592,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.09,h82
2593,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.28,better tasting than regular michelob ultra or some of the other shitty flavors it comes in better than pure gold very watered down amber beer about the same mouthfeel as yuengling light 95 calories is impressive definitely can slam back some of these there better than some but worse than more if that makes any sense
2594,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.78,12 ounce bottle into lager glass bottled on 1262016 pours crystal clear deep golden amber light orange color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation aromas of cracker white bread dough and toasted biscuit with lighter notes of honey caramel roast wood pepper and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness minimal fruity notes in the aromas nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of paleroast malts and lightmoderate earthy hop notes with solid strength taste of cracker white bread dough and toasted biscuit with lighter notes of honey caramel roast wood pepper and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness light herbal floral woody grassy peppery bitterness on the finish lingering notes of cracker white bread dough toasted biscuit honey caramel roast wood pepper and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit nice robustness complexity and balance of paleroast malts and lightmoderate earthy hop flavors with a great maltbitterness balance and no cloyingastringent flavors after the finish moderately crispclean finishing perfectly clean on lager flavors with no fruityyeasty notes present lightmoderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness medium carbonation and lightmedium body with a very smooth moderately breadygrainy and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice zero warming alcohol as expected of 4 overall this is a very good amber light lager all around nice robustness complexity and balance of paleroast malts and lightmoderate earthy hop flavors very smooth crisp clean and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitterdrying finish very flavorful and not watery for the abv very clean paleroast malt showcase with nice earthy hop presencebalance for the style mild residual sweetness with crisp dryness a very enjoyable offering and outstanding style example one of the best light lagers i have had
2595,Michelob Ultra Amber,2.8,32 carbs 95 cals 4 abv 12 fl oz 699 usd per sixer  i bought this because i was pleasantly surprised by michelob lager but this compares unfavorably to that superior lager this has some toasty amber malt notes but theyre buried leaving only an insipid onetwo punch of 2row barley and muted noble hop grassiness to satiate  shallow and simple but certainly drinkable not a beer id want to revisit another sixer of but theres no doubting itd pair fine with pizza or spicy wings  low c 280  average
2596,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.88,i like this solid light and easy drinking beer
2597,Old Rasputin,4.67,looks  the old rasputin has an awesome thick head and the color is midnight black aromas  getting nutty and chocolate notes this one feels very thick in the mouth and im getting strong malt chocolate and woody like notes  overall just an awesome beer
2598,Old Rasputin,4.49,one of my favorites the coop down the street sells it a bottle at a time
2599,Old Rasputin,3.92,one of the first i tried when i got into beer years back and still one i often fall back on when theres nothing new im interested in beautiful black lacing that wont quit alcohol definitely comes thru a little strong on the nose but not too bad on the taste feel could be better little fizzy i dont know how else to describe it
2600,Old Rasputin,4.36,on tap at my formerly favorite watering hole even worse was it was on special making it deliciously delicious  all i can say is wow i normally cant session stouts but this one went down smooth a few of them and i was on cloud 9 the abv sneaks up on you so be careful
2601,Old Rasputin,4.79,nothing i dont like about this beer great sipping beer just buy it
2602,Old Rasputin,4.47,color is black with a mocha head smell is roast malty and a little sweet taste has caramel and malt upfront with a bitter coco finish the feel is a little oily and clingy at first but then smooth this is an outstanding example of an imperial stout which makes it dangerously drinkable
2603,Old Rasputin,4.48,black in color light creamy brown head dense with some staying power some lace  nose is rich in roasted aromas dark chocolate that carries some fudge aspects espresso strong hop presence as well adds to the perception of incoming bitter flavors  taste mostly mirrors the nose this beer is dark chocolate and espresso but it carries a chocolate richness to it as well the finish is very hoppy pine and rind like in nature  high end of medium for body it has a luscious creamy feel to it super smooth on the palette and a big kick of bitter american hops on the finishthe roast also adds a substantial bitterness as well  i dont really drink stouts but i do drink this beer because it is perfectly balanced and just overall amazing to sip on
2604,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.15,2022 bottling in a 22oz bomber shared with the mrs my serving in a snifter no abv listed on the bottle  appearance black and letting no light through but very dark brown by the time i got to the bottom of the glass thin tan head with some islands of lacing noted  smell mostly bourbon after warming it up quite a bit i got some additional vanilla something metallic and a hint of roasted malts still mostly bourbon  taste strong bourbon flavor  really dominates the rest of the beer some vanilla roasted malts a bit of dark chocolate sweet malt and lightly bitter finish  mouthfeel good thickness light carbonation but quite warming from the alcohol  overall  drinkability im guessing this beer is variable abv each year and this version was on the high side i could feel it halfway through the glass pretty hot overall and i suspect it may have mellowed out if i let it sit a year otherwise good but not great far too much bourbon and the underlying blackout stout i know so well is lost under all the bourbon
2605,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.12,22oz bottle labeled 2022 poured into a tulip pint glass at just above fridge temp no abv listed on label the beer pours the darkest brown possible with minimal light penetration and light brown head the head recedes to a thin ring and scattered tiny bubbles the aroma is mild with bakers chocolate oak and coffee the taste is bittersweet roasted malt with notes of charred barrel dark chocolate and slight bourbon minimal to medium bitterness the mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with low carbonation and a semi dry finish overall good the low carbonation really throws this beer off theres not enough barrel or abv to counteract the sweetness with no carbonation causing it to feel syrupy and unbalanced
2606,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.35,22 ounce bottle 2022 vintage didnt see an abv on the label nice to see this one finally get distributed served in a snifter the beer pours dark brownblack with about an inch tan head head retention and lacing are both good i like the aroma the brew smells like burntcharred malt vanilla dark chocolate coffee and some bourbon taste is similar to the aroma but with the addition of some oak dark fruit and earthy flavors barrel character shows up more in the flavor mouthfeelbody is mediumfull its slick and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation i thought this was a good barrel aged brew certainly worth picking up some if you get the chance
2607,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.44,from the tap  great lakes brewpub cleveland oh christmas eve 2022
2608,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4,how does the abv lower if ifs aged in a barrel anyways this was really good to me still but honestly underwhelming nowhere near the same flavor nuances as the og but im liking that one less too weird i also dont understand how the ba version is somehow lower in abv than the original
2609,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.34,at the cincinnati beer fest 2022
2610,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,3.99,look  really nice black and thick with a nice tan head and lacing smell  coffee chocolate taste  coffee chocolate slight barrel and toasted malts feel  medium body with medium light carb overall  pretty basic and a little thin
2611,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.14,2015 vintage 12oz bottle poured into a tulip  a pours black in color with a onefinger foamy khaki head that has short retention  s plenty of roast on the nose with some wet ash chocolate and licorice a bit meaty with raisin and fig oaky bourbon undertones  t chocolate and charred malt up front complimented by some raisin and licorice midpalate brings out a big barrel note adding barrel juice wet oak and a peppery note the finish continues with more oaky barrel before lingering with chocolate and char  m medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into a slightly warming finish  o a solid straight up stout with some nice barrel notes throughout
2612,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.48,my god this is certainly one of my favorite beers i was never a big stout guy until i tried this unbelievably rich in flavor and texture poured into a regular beer glass incredibly dark with a great tone
2613,Blessed,4.63,2021 editiion drank may 2022 so sweet even the small bottle was a lot to drink solo ten years was much more balanced
2614,Blessed,4.85,pours squid ink black and settles in the glass like a black velvet cloak stopping all light sitting under a sudsy dark tan head that dissipates quickly as expected with a beer of this gravity absolutely gorgeous imperial stout  i dont know if the nose of a beer can be decadent but this beers nose is with rich cocoa and vanilla notes up front some dark cherries and a sledgehammer of oak and barrel notes  the taste is led by the vanilla and cocoa notes and they are rich and chewy moving into the dark cherry flavors to cut the sweetness a bit and then finishing with the oak and a welcome boozy warming from the three bourbon barrels featured in this beer  the mouthfeel is as rich and decadent as a gooey bourbon soaked brownie sitting in a dip of vanilla ice cream i cant imagine a more perfect rendering of a ba imperial stout
2615,Blessed,4.83,if woodford reserve willet and heavenly hill were to get together and make a beery baby they would be so blessed to have this stout slumbering away for extended aging these three barrels give anchorage brewing a love child that can compete with the best  jet black and pouring like inky tar blessed pours with a luscious ominous and velvety pour while shy on froth the overwhelming scent of molasses chocolate whisky oak coconut and cream align with stronger scents of coffee and campfire once on the tongue the immense sweetness of molasses brown sugar and fudge carry and nearly browniebatter taste with those sweeter bourbon barrels playing a maple and coconut sweetness  as the sweeter flavors swirl on the tastebuds notions of mound and almond joy pop off of the middle palate while the malts remain juicy and plush trailing into a smooth espresso cappuccino character the late taste brings out all of those coconut toasted oak vanilla cherry and savory smoke to have the session trending warm sultry and savory set of pleasantries  full bodied pillowy and fortified with nearly portlike proportions the stout is simply magical it pushes the boundaries in what is a fully malted imperial stout before pushing into the pastry realm the warmth of whisky is soothed with caramel malts vanilla and coconut and balances the sheer malts with utter ease

2622,Double Shot,4.6,looks like motor oil completely opaque foam like dalgona coffee notes of molasses vanilla and coconut on the nose taste is nicely balanced with tons of bittersweet chocolate nice mouthfeel not too heavy overall a great stout perfect for a late fall day
2623,Double Shot,4.42,appearance  the beer poured a silky black color with brown bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass  smell  the nose had a strong coffee presence with noted sweetness  taste there was a lot of coffee here notes of chocolate syrup and light vanilla were also present it was not overly sweet to the point of being calling and allowing the coffee to shine the coffee and chocolate continued in the finish  mouthfeel  the body was slick and not overly thick with small bubbles  overall  this is a great stout that coffee stout lovers will love
2624,Double Shot,4.36,i usually like to sample a base beer before dipping into variants however when it comes to th i take what i can get when i can get it so i tried the espresso version of this beer before sampling the og version that is before me now  pours a deep dark browntoblack color with over a finger of head that is milk chocolate in color like the espresso variant i am not overly impressed by the nose  some coffee not much else  the flavor profile is dominated by fresh black coffee the bitterness off the roasted beans is the highlight here the body is hearty and the finish has just enough residual sweetness to counteract the bitter coffee
2625,Double Shot,4.42,jet black body opaque thick frothy light brown head long lasting patchy splotches of foam stick to the glass rich dark roasted malt smell cacao nibs and bitter chocolate rich and flavorful taste fine blend of sweet and bitter chocolate chocolate fudge and brownies bourbon undercurrent bitter heavy body heavy sweetness throughout with a mild dryness at the finish  ah a coffee stout eh after the fact i can sense coffee but its wellhidden on my palate still this is a rich decadent stout and quite the treasure  pouring temperature 42 f canning info spring 2023 source ocalafox
2626,Double Shot,4.4,big dark foamy head nice blend of coffee malt and vanilla  smooth
2627,Double Shot,4.29,looka black viscous motor oil with a vibrant chocolaty wealth of big and little bubbles of light brown smella rich chocolate and coffee but faint with a malt back molasses and hint of alcohol tastea rich roasty chocolate malt with almost no hint of coffee i think that the coffee presence has been quelled or reduced by the nine months on this beer anyway a complex sweetness and a bitterness that is definitely overpowered feeli believe the best quality of this beer a pesky fullness with the 82 abv seemingly heavier to me to me this is the part of the beer that i fin craft beers are so superior to the huge stout boys like founders sierra just to name a few  the local varieties have a creamier touch overallthis is a sweet stout i believe the time on this beer holding it for science haha has made this beer sweeter than the normal and a practice i would not do to this beer in the future still a well made beer but i like a little more balance of bitter reevaluation is in order i believe i liked this beer on the fresher
2628,Double Shot,4.46,received a 16 oz can in a trade from dim 101922 no canning date consumed 21223  beer poured black with a pretty tan head that has some good hang time  nose is nice coffee forward with notes of mildly roasted malts  taste is really nice a larger medium roasted malt base that is enhanced nicely with a dose of espresso finished perfectly balanced and no astringency  mouthfeel is perfection medium bodied and one of the smoothest beers i ever had  overall this is a really good world class coffee stout
2629,Double Shot,4.15,from a 16oz can with a spring 2023 date stamp which inasmuch as its still early february puzzles somewhat served in a tulip  pours an unhighlighted chestnutblack oily in appearance with a finger of coffeecolored foam retention is on the order of a minute or two leaving a thin tattered sheet of lacing  a pleasantly warm and roasty mildly sweet nose aroma of molassessweetened coffee and bakers chocolate dreamy  taste is utterly in line with the nose sparing me the trouble of having to think of new words molassessweetened coffee and bakers chocolate a dulce de leche sort of caramelized milk and vanilla character comes forward with the coffee as the beer sits theres an oily prickly tingle throughout which is as much a taste as a feel  feel is thick and syrupy unctuous heavy bodied with oily superfine prickly carbonation  overall overly sweet and syrupy to my tastes i understand the appeal i just dont quite share it still at 82 it sure as hell gets the job done i mean right
2630,Xocoveza,4.37,have had before and certainly had fresher as this bottle had a best before date of july 17  2018 this is on me  in my cellar at 60 degrees f it pours a really nice dense black with scant tan head  again 5 years oldso my fault on the head amazing nose with chocolate cinnamon spice and vanilla  perhaps a hint of roasty coffee  but the spice notes are just right taste is smooth with chocolate note vanilla sweetness and cinnamon spice yet maintains a bit of a roast coffee note also with a hint of bitterness despite the limited head this maintains a brisk carbonation and a beautifully silky creamy mouthfeel hopefully stone sapporo sends some fresh stuff north to canada as pretty sure this 5 year old bottle was the last time sold here
2631,Xocoveza,5,this is my first sample im wary of stouts made with lactose because while i have had a couple of good ones  espressway and two die 4 by two roads  ive had sickeningly sweet examples such as gunners daughter from mast landing and brig from springdale  in any event this particular brew is black in color it boasts a thick lasting tan head the nose is muted initially it is faintly redolent of sweetness cream and spice  it is creamy and mediumbodied in feel  the palate stuns me beautiful flavors of dark chocolate and coffee meld flawlessly with a variety of spices the spice component is perfect it is not overdone  the beers high abv is utterly hidden  i have nothing but praise for this stout it is the best beer from stone ive ever had it is perfect
2632,Xocoveza,4.25,122521 shared bottle  brians
2633,Xocoveza,4.23,ive had this fresh and cellared  jet black body with a dark khaki head picking up cinnamon coffee and dark chocolate taste fresh has chocolate cinnamon slight chili pepper and warm spices taste with a couple of years changed a little more of a roasted coffee and chocolate and little to no chili peppers but the cinnamon and cardamom spices are a little more prevalent mouthfeel fresh and aged is full and satisfying a decent lingering chocolate spice cake on the tongue a really tasty beer fresh or with a little age on it actually i prefer it with a couple of years
2634,Xocoveza,4.25,on tap at cardinal pub bar stavanger black colour tan head aroma and flavour of roast malts coffee cinnamon nutmeg lactose chili peppers very good and unusual beer
2635,Xocoveza,4.33,look 95 black  smell light chocolate coffee  taste roasted malt the chocolate flavor is actually not that strong and i can barely taste the pepper or cinnamon  feel creamy and smooth maybe a little too bitter tho  overall this is far away from treehouse milk stouts its overrated in my opinion
2636,Xocoveza,4.25,robust dark and bold with fine lacing distinct hints of cinnamon peppers spices and chocolate in both the nose and palate it all finishes strongly and slowly
2637,Xocoveza,3.75,cinnamon upfront followed by some spice from the peppers with a coffee finish the more you drink the better it gets
2638,Thicket,4.24,blend 1 on tap at the cellar nice and tart just funky enough wine barrels did this well quite enjoyable would really like to contract with blend 2 eventually
2639,Very Hazy,4.63,quite certain ive had this one before but apparently never reviewed yeah its decent i lack the flair with my superlatives these days to detail the nuances if you can get your hands on this one do so
2640,Very Hazy,4.34,pours like opaque guava juice with a 2 finger creamy offwhite head that faded extremely slowly and left really nice lacing on the glass it smells like tangerine orange juice papaya tropical fruit dank citrus hops faint biscuit a hint of caramel and some flowery spices as it fades the flavor was very similar to the nose with tangerine orange juice papaya tropical fruit and the additions of peaches lemon zest and citrus hops that have off the dry hopped vibe more malty backbone in the taste with sweet grains biscuit chalky yeast graham cracker and then spices like coriander or white pepper in the finish the bitterness level was perfect and the taste completely hid the abv this indeed was very hazy and very tasty overall
2641,Very Hazy,4.68,43023 canned 41922 what more could you ask for in a neipa as good as any ive had as advertised
2642,Very Hazy,4.47,pours like straight up juice with one finger of eggshell colored head  s citrus  tropical fruits nose couldve been better nice head retention  lacing  t grapefruit kiwi fruit grassiness pineapple  dryness up front lime peaches oranges  pineapple as this beer warms up acidic notes from the pineapple some grassy notes as well finishes with pineapple  orange plus limes  mf medium body fairly restrained carbonation carbonation goes creamy as this warms up nice balance  very nice take on the style just got better as this warmed up if everything else was equal to the flavor i would rated this higher
2643,Burton Baton,4.37,poured from 12ounce bottle into a tulip glass dark copperamber color with orange highlights and orangetinged white head that left some streaky lacing as it subsided aroma and flavor are malt forward with notes of orange popping out very boozy with some oaky barrel astringence also tons of hop bitterness as it warms notes of dried fruit and dark bread begin to emerge id say this is to be enjoyed more as a fine cordial than as a beer iow a slow sipper
2644,Burton Baton,4.29,pours a copper color smells of a light vanilla probably hops and oak the taste was that of a clean and crisp beer very tasty and delicious the 10 abv is hidden but effective i like it and will definitely get more when i get the next chance
2645,Burton Baton,3.94,it smells both like wood and the bright freshness of hops with just a little bread water in the background  it tastes very interesting the wood sweetness and boozy flavor from the 10 abv remind me of whiskey not bourbon because theres no smoke after the whiskey you get bright hops and bitterness  the mouthfeel is very light with just a little fizz it finishes with an aftertaste of bitterness with breathy alcohol  overall its very good i wouldnt describe it as an ipa its a beer i cant really categorize i give it a 49 out of 6 i think it would have received over a 5 if it hadnt come right after that insanely good stout
2646,Burton Baton,4.31,backlog
2647,Burton Baton,4.57,coming back to this after a long time a real throwback to taste so much malt in a doubleipa though i know this was a cross between a dipa and an old ale back when dipas first arrived on the scene many of them tasted this way like a hopped up barleywine or old ale if i close my eyes it feels like im back in 1999 in a good way dogfish was way ahead of the curve in oakaging a beer like this warming caramel and hop notes with the alcohol wellhidden as it should be hits the spot on a cold night when snow is in the forecast masterfully done glad i revisited this classic
2648,Burton Baton,3.7,had this on draft a pours orange amber body with offwhite head with ok retention and lacing s sweet orange grapefruit smelling beer with subtle earthiness t sweet grapefruit taste with a subtle earthy aftertaste some lemon notes as well m medium bodied and pretty smooth d nice mouthfeel and tasting combo solid drinking beer overall pretty good beer overall
2649,Augustiner Br√§u M√§rzen Bier,4.82,finally able to buytry this drove through salzburg to get to italy and had to stop here on a friday afternoon unfortunately too early for the beer to be enjoyed from the tap but they were selling bottlescases from the delivery bay of the brewery date on label of 13042023 great price all things considered another bummer was that the following wednesday they were releasing their lent bier so i just missed that will have to return next lent to try that nectar and buy more of the marzen  speaking of nectar this is the real deal i had huge expectations and it matched them so easy drinking yet fulfilling and rich with massive malt flavor sweet yet perfectly balanced slight hop presence towards the end of each sip body feel everything is outstanding this is what i expected beer to taste like when i arrived in europe im jealous of these monks
2650,Augustiner Br√§u M√§rzen Bier,4.86,a flawless beer pretty excellent in the bottle but unreal on tap a really full taste quite fruity with no bitter lingering taste in the mouth like some m√§rzen almost bananay scent and then full bodied and slightly sweet  have travelled for hours to have this on tap on a whim if you can get a bottle do so
2651,Augustiner Br√§u M√§rzen Bier,3.41,drunk directly at the venue from a 05 litre mug it is a nice smooth marzen better than the ones i am usted to in spain the venue adds a plus value
2652,Augustiner Br√§u M√§rzen Bier,4.46,flawless crystal clear bone white head robust great malt thirst quenching lends itself to session drinking finished clean bottles bought at the source today
2653,Augustiner Br√§u M√§rzen Bier,4.73,one of the best most crushable beers i have ever drank its doesnt hurt that the beer garden at the brewery is one of the most relaxing places this is a beer is will never forget drinking 5 liters of in a evening
2654,Augustiner Br√§u M√§rzen Bier,5,no review will do this beer justice go to salzburg and just drink this beer at the source it will be one of the greatest beer experiences of your life
2655,Augustiner Br√§u M√§rzen Bier,3.58,at the kloster mulln beer hall in salzburg may 2014 the weather was chilly and wet and the huge beer garden was empty unforgettable experience inside choose a ceramic stein rinse with hot or cold water or not pay cashier and get receipt hand receipt to pourer and receive brew beer comes from a big wooden cask gravity fed but well carbonated since the cask is emptied so quickly  augustiner maerzen beer tastes better than the typical austrian maerzen austrian beers were once the classic amber maerzen lagers but the ones i tried were continental pils types augustiner leans more toward bavarian helles
2656,Augustiner Br√§u M√§rzen Bier,5,there is not much to say about this beer only that it is the greatest beer in the world it is worth a special trip to salzburg just to try it  truly legendary
2657,Fresh Squeezed IPA,5,one of the most refreshing ipas ive ever had a perfect balance oh hops sweetness and citrus i bought this one randomly but after just one bottle i knew it was going to become my goto ipa
2658,Fresh Squeezed IPA,3.58,pours clear with light head and golden color aromas are flowery and candy like very strong and pleasant taste is nice but not as good as what i was expecting for the ratings i was seeing i was expecting this to taste a lot jucier has some sour after notes and not as bitter as i was hoping for has a thick feel in the mouth but feels too bubbly like too much carbonation  a good beer for sure but i doubt that i would buy this one again
2659,Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.17,12oz can bottom stamp reads pkg on 042423 mostly clear deep gold colored body three fingers of off white head which after a couple of minutes reduces to a fluffy cap leaves behind wide horizontal strips of lacing aroma of toasted caramel malts orange pineapple and pine resin taste is kind of sweet and proclaims loudly the citrus and pine bitterness is noticeable but not extreme all fade slowly in the aftertaste medium mouth feel juicy yet drying at the end excellent carbonation very solid ipa which really embraces the expression of hops
2660,Fresh Squeezed IPA,3.81,poured from a bottle into a pint glass pours copper red with a small white head smells of citrus and floral hops tastes of citrus hops with nice grain beer is light bodied and easy drinking overall a good beer
2661,Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.31,july 2023 hartwell extremely hearty and meringue like head overall a very well balanced beer karen thought it was too orange and i needed to deduct a few points slightly better will probably try it again
2662,Fresh Squeezed IPA,3.9,look deep cloudy amber with creamy off white head smell apricot malt butterscotch taste malty medium hops feel full body with nice carbonation  nice brew
2663,Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.25,fresh squeezed ipa is in my top 5 favorite ipa beers thank you deschutes brewery for making a great beer
2664,Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.48,classic aroma and taste of an ipa for me it is better than 90 of the ipa i have tasted look light golden color taste the taste is rich manly and fruity a lingering light bitterness in the after taste
2665,Fresh Squeezed IPA,3.37,poured copper golden with offwhite head but has a ton of chunks suspended in it about the size of seasalt grains canned on 1232023 so maybe it is nearing the end of its bestby stage not very appealing look smell is good though with typical pine and citrus taste is fine but the hops have diminished greatly much malt on the palette too much malt for the style likely because of how old the beer is even though 4 months is not very long feel is okay still carbonated but nothing special overall old beer i would not touch this again unless its less than 2 months old
2666,Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.21,one of the best widely distributed ipas along with dogfish head
2667,Brahma,1.36,nov 2011 330 ml clear bottle as brahma cerveja do brasil rio de janeiro  brasil premium lager brewed and distributed by inbev uk ltd luton lu1 3ls abv is 43 bought at carrefour cartagena spain golden colour moderate white head weak grassy and sweetish industrial aroma thin mouthfeel utterly bland and boring flavour nothing pleasant about it at all the little flavour there is is metallic dusty cardboardy and industrial stomachturning and revolting drainpour
2668,Brahma,2,akin to a weak mexican lager
2669,Brahma,3,b33
2670,Black Note Stout,4.25,recording my review from memory i drank this last night but wasnt able to write it up  12oz bottle my friend drank half and gifted the rest of the bottle for me he had suggested that we drink it together but our schedules didnt match up and he wanted to crack it open no bottling date this is the 2017 vintage so this beer is probably 5 12 to 6 years old  look pours a very dark brown almost black color with impressive carbonation for a sixyearold bourbon barrelaged stout there was a thin brownishcolored head that reduced to a wispy layer the head regenerates temporarily after swirling the glass  smell up front the aromas on this beer at least at this age are all umami all the time it has that rich interesting soy sauce note that is blended with dark chocolate and subtle dried fruit aromas secondary notes of vanilla and amaretto  taste i am really impressed that this beer has aged so well i was expecting it to be dull and flat but it is really smooth rich very flavorful its also really drinkable and there is basically no heat on the palate the umami flavor is really nice and then the beer has a nice dark chocolate richness the beer has subtle sweetness and the finish is mildly bitter with nice roasted malt character the amaretto note is also really nice  feel its not thin and its not especially thick either its somewhere in the middle i would say that it is medium plus bodied the mouthfeel is nice with soft carbonation  overall its very tasty and really enjoyable ive never had this before it would be nice to get a fresh batch of this beer and enjoy one every year to see how it develops over time
2671,Black Note Stout,4.38,amazing no adjunct barrel aged stout look is black onyx smell is bourbon chocolate taste is chocolate bourbon goodness this is a solid old school legend
2672,Black Note Stout,4.46,1829 name black note stout brewery bells location comstock mi style barrelaged imperial stout date 10052017 this beer has been on my wants for a long time but i thought i would never get the chance to try it i was sent this in a box by a fellow beer friend using a tulip glass i served the beer at 52 degrees the pour created a one in half finger length head with dismal retention no lacing was left on the glass after the quick dissipation charting the color of the beer somewhere around srm 34 dark brown nearly black the appearance is slightly above average regardless of the head retention nosing the glass i detected bourbon oak espresso dark chocolate cream oats raisins molasses caramel toasted bread dark roasted malts a hint of char and a notion of floral sipping the beer i taste bourbon oranges oak resin molasses milk chocolate dark coffee raisins caramel toffee toasted bread crust oats a tinge of soy sauce a hint of maillard and a little smoky char the mouthfeel is thick and coated the body is a medium plus has low carbonation and has a delicious finish this beer held up beautifully i am pleased to have the opportunity to quaff on this stout thank you kindly for allowing to have this chance to try a retired beer simply a fantastic beer
2673,Black Note Stout,4.37,2016 vintage  another bif beer from eziel and they only retired beer of the lot this one was quite the highly regarded beer in its time peaking at roughly 78 overall based on data from the wayback machine lets see if it can hold up to the barrel aged stouts of today  pours an opaque medium brown with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing  man this packs a boozy punch in the nose for a relatively low 112 im picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon black cherry plum cocoa pwoder fruity coffee toasted oak light tobacco and vanilla  its a bit less fruity and more maltfocused in taste but still just as good on the front end of the sip im tasting black cherry cocoa powder caramel brown sugar toasted oak sweet bourbon vanilla and lightly burnt coffee the swallow brings notes of hot bourbon burnt coffee charred oak cocoa powder raisin sweet vanilla toasted hazelnut and caramel  a full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation from the booze resulting in a rich beer finishes surprisingly dry roasty and balanced by sweeter notes for a shockingly drinkable stout  damn i liked this one more than i had expected to even at 6 years old this is really good its too bad they retired this one
2674,Black Note Stout,4.44,12oz bottle into a goblet 2016 release so 5 years old  looks superb in the glass jet black body generous tan head shrinks to a ring and faint covering impressive given the abv and leaves streaks and spots of lacing  aroma is wonderfully boozy with a lot of dried dark fruit  on tasting so smooth boozy nicely warms the back of the throat the dried fruit notes add a hint of sweetness  the mouth is a bit thinner than you might think but it still rolls around the tongue beautifully finish is a warming smooth booziness with a faint sweet note  overall delightful sipper of a beer been after this one for a while so thanks to the mighty sabatinis in exeter pa for releasing a case from the cellar
2675,Black Note Stout,4.9,87 good folly miss molly
2676,Pumking - Caramel,3.56,i was excited to try this pumpkin ale and had heard it was great to be honest everything was fine with the pour and the nose but the taste was straight up cream soda to me not that i dislike cream soda but i just couldnt get past it a decent beer but i didnt get a lot of pumpkin etc an average one to me i much prefer the original pumking
2677,Pumking - Caramel,4.21,great new pumpkin beer added to the southern tier fall lineup good caramel flavor and not over the top pumpkin
2678,Pumking - Caramel,3.79,tis the season for pumpkin beers this one is not bad poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass this beer features a beautiful clear light copper color and a small foamy white head with somewhat better than average retention light lacing on the glass taste is malty with a nice blend of caramel and pumpkinpumpkin spices dont know if the pumpkin spices could have made this beer artificial tasting because the caramel adds a good bit of sweetness and flavor mouthfeel is rich and maltya slow sipper there is no alcohol harshness the sweetness is not overdone not just another dessert beer i had it with a pork chop dinner and it went really well
2679,Pumking - Caramel,3.89,so sweet it has to be a slow drink
2680,Pumking - Caramel,4,pours a clear orange thin foam caramel aroma caramel and pumpkin spice body spicy bitter finish pretty sweet not my favorite in the series but its still pretty good
2681,Pumking - Caramel,3.62,clear nearly transparent dark amber body good head production and retention  aroma is a bit musty implying a heavy hand of the dry spices caramel isnt particularly noticeable but it may be hiding along with the malt base otherwise this smells like a fairly classic pumpkin ale  which pumpking is it smells quite good but it also portends too much dry spice which can easily overwhelm a beer  the hefty 86 base helps fend off that dry spice on the palate but its still more of a player than id prefer theres a hint of the artificiality of regular pumking that i detest but its honestly not quite as bad  but also not as solid as warlock at the same time the caramel doesnt quite add enough its there when you know to look for it but otherwise could easily be overlooked the pie crust is a lovely addition honestly as it adds a slightly sweet and grainy flavor to the malt base in complementary fashion  overall this isnt bad and it fits the season its an improvement over regular pumking but its not going to be a pumpkin ale i happily reach for either  on the rare occasion im in such a mood at all
2682,Pumking - Caramel,4.4,ok just for clarity this isnt caramel pumpkin although caramel appears in bold capital letters above pumpkin imperial pumpkin ale on the label the label even suggests rule on caramel none of the semantics matters after two twelve ounce brown bottles are emptied into a clear glass liter mug theres very little head the brew is a bright and relatively clear copperamber the aroma brings modest pumpkin pie spices with an additional sweetness this is a wonderful extension of the imperial pumpkin mainstay from this brewery pumpkin and warlock are pumpkin brews without reproach add this one to that list the caramel inclusion is very tastefully done it doesnt overly sweeter the brew it only adds a minor taste that makes a major enjoyment adding just a little caramel sweetness and body does nothing to shortchange the original pumpkin ale everything true to the original remains in tact here like taste body and mouthfeel thats a good thing because this brewery has few rivals when it comes to imperial pumpkin ales this is a pleasant although not drastic variation on a very successful brew
2683,Pumking - Caramel,4.12,best by date 71725  a  dark medium golden orange color with perfect clarity vibrant steady carbonation and a thick creamy white layer of foam across the entire top looks great  s  caramel and pumpkin spice dominate the nose  t  pumpkin cinnamon nutmeg and caramel while ending with a pleasing moderate bitterness a little bit of alcohol pokes through but doesnt deter from the overall flavor  m  big silky smooth body that rounds the prickly carbonation off  o  i like this better than this years batch of regular pumking usually prefer the original over the variants but this one works
2684,Pumking - Caramel,3.29,bottleneck says best by 71725 huh i suppose its safe to assume this was bottled on the same day this year whatever  pours a golden copper with a solid finger of head which thins to a ring with a modicum of lacing smells pretty strongly not necessarily of caramel but like toffee hard candies i get a bit of baking spice as well but yeah mostly just overwhelming candy sweetness a dessert beer for sure taste brings a good deal of vanilla to the party i suppose its there on the nose too just buried a bit butterscotch liquor not as sweet as feared finishes on the dry side in fact good pie cruststyle malt base the beers strong point imo a little boozy mediumtofull bodied kind of a weird one but that might be owing to the fact that im drinking it in late summer its definitely not a summer beer even if it is on the cooler side today i think im going to sit on a couple of these this feels like it would be a good postthanksgiving dinner beer fuck you seasonal creep
2685,Pumking - Caramel,3.59,september 2023 hartwell the original is much much better do not really have the pumpkin spice caramels a little sweet and overpowering i would not buy this again
2686,Imperial Stout,4.56,12 oz bottle bottled on date 11202016 consumed on 20 nov 2022 glass snifter abv 105 serving temp 493 f   look jet black with a brown head that is very thin the head quickly dissipates to a ring with some film over parts of the beer what lacing exists is excellent  smell dark bittersweet chocolate and coffee char molasses anise caramelized and somewhat burnt sugar a fair amount of earth  taste an earthy and bitter hit up front but nothing overwhelming this becomes char dark chocolate and some coffee molasses and anise follow the earthy notes return towards the end the sip finishes bittersweet and this lingers into and through the aftertaste which is very much unsweetened chocolate  feel silky and mouthcoating a nice warmth from the alcohol the body is only a shade or 2 lighter than full  overall an excellent russian imperial stout one of my favorites of the style i buy it when i see it which last was in 2019  i purchased this beer fresh back in december 2016 it has been in my cellar ever since it has handled its age 6 years quite well i would say
2687,Imperial Stout,4.33,2015 bottle poured into a founders brewing co snifter  a pours basically black with a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a light layer and leaves a little nice lacing  s roasty earthy a little char dark chocolate coffee molasses burnt sugar slight umami notes and faint hints of dark fruit  t roasted malt dark chocolate black coffee a little char earthy molasses a touch of toffee and faint dark fruit on the finish  m full body mild carbonation creamy smooth  o somehow i think this one went straight from the store to my cellar and has been there ever since so its about time i crack into it total time capsule back to before every imperial stout was loaded up with adjuncts and its aged beautifully another example of why founders is quite possibly the best at brewing dark beers
2688,Imperial Stout,4.69,12 oz bottle born on 11519 poured into a snifter at 55 degrees f l  dark mahogany with a hazelnut head that lingered around the edges s  roasted malt molasses bitter chocolate coffee t  follows the nose very well f  thick mouthfeel with minimal carbonation o  this beer lives up to the founders standard it is supposed to age well and just under 25 years in it is still sensational
2689,Imperial Stout,4.43,single 12 ounce bottle from founders in grand rapids nov 2019 when travel was still a thing pours pitch black with finger of creamy mildly reddish brown head aroma of dark fruits caramel mildly roasty with notes of chocolate and just a hint of coffee taste is rich with plummy note chocolate a brief wave of smoke drifts across the palate caramel malt and a touch of espresso bitterness balancing the sweetness rich and smooth full creamy mouthfeel with a hint of boozy heat  wonderfully bittersweet wish more had followed me home
2690,Imperial Stout,4.23,look poured from 12 oz bottle into a snifter midnight black with a creamy burnt amber head wonderful looking beer  smell roasted coffee beans malts caramel dark chocolate  taste chocolate cacao malts coffee also getting some dried fruits  possibly cranberry or cherry  feel creamy thick mouthfeel this thing just rips as it goes down has a dark feel to it literally and figuratively great for sipping with a book gets better as it warms  overall one of the best russian imperial stouts you can find pretty widely available highly recommend if dark evil beers are your thing pick this up
2691,Imperial Stout,4.24,12oz bottle this thing has been aged in the minifridge for 5 years and now is the time to crack this sucker  it still has a decent amount of carbonation and a nice little ring of foam it was meant to age this is telling me smells like coffee alcohol chocolate and hops prominent alcohol flavor even at chilled temps and with the age on it this was a bad boy back in the day i bet tons of cocoa powder and a honey malt backing that compliments and stands up to the choco malt and alcohol flavors that come close to dominating
2692,Imperial Stout,4.4,355 ml bottle from the norwegian importer abv is 105 90 ibu pitch black colour impressive brown head roasty aroma roast malts strong coffee dark chocolate liquorice tar wood and a hint of smoke rich mouthfeel medium sweet and rich flavour roast malts liquorice and strong coffee galore bitter hops in the finish high wow factor
2693,Castle Lager,2.58,march 2004 330 ml bottle pale golden colour large thick head fruity melonlike aroma flavour is typical industrial lager a bit sweet not something im busy trying to sample again
2694,Castle Lager,2.76,710 ml can into an imperial pint glass strawgolen yellow wsoapy head smell of grainsricecereal taste is bland but not skunky thank goodness feel was light and watery yet crisp  refreshing on a hot day over all not great but better than most in its category ba frustrates me with low scores of beers like thisthe bros are too snooty for my taste lol
2695,Castle Lager,2.51,a the beer is crystal clear yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation it poured with a quarter finger high white head that died down but never completely faded away s light aromas of pale malts and skunk are present in the nose t the taste follows the smell and has a bit stronger but still light flavors of skunked pale malts there is a faint amount of bitterness m it feels a bit more than lightbodied a bit smooth and rather clean on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation o this beer is easy to drink and has a nice mouthfeel its not that flavorful but the skunk in the smell and taste is rather minimal  serving type can
2696,Castle Lager,1.78,as a south african it pains me to concede how poor this beer is growing up there was nothing better than an ice cold castle in a bottle on a hot day now its taste ranges from awful to metallic to metallic corn awful not sure if the recipe has changed or if mgmt has just let it fail
2697,Castle Lager,2.63,a pours a crystal clear pale yellow in color with moderate to heavy amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and faint pale golden yellow colored highlights the beer has a finger tall sudsy bright white head that reduces to a large patch of slightly mottled very thin film covering a little more than 65 of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass light amounts of lacing are observed  s light to moderate aromas of grainy malts with a hint of rice  corn adjuncts and a light amount of grainy sweetness hints of grassy hops  t upfront there are just shy of moderate flavors of grainy malts with a hint of rice  corn adjuncts and a light amount of grainy sweetness that is followed by very light flavors of grassy hops which impart a light to moderate amount of bitterness which slowly fades away  m slightly heavier than light bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation crisp with a clean finish  o easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and a pleasantly crisp clean mouthfeel similar to the big aals from american breweries not bad but not something that i would seek out again would pair easily with foods and be refreshing in a very warm climate
2698,Castle Lager,3,z01
2699,Castle Lager,4.92,castle lager is an excellent all around beer it is your typical light lager but with just a touch of extra bitterness that makes the beer taste crisp and refreshing its good for hot summer days at the beach and good for barbecues its also a great beer after a hard days work no matter the season
2700,Castle Lager,1.66,review 330 ml bottle of castle lager abv 5 vol  nice brown bottle with a a logo of a castle go figure but nice all the same  appearance is one of a clear golden colour with a white head that doesnt stay around some small carbonation going on and overall the beer is not much to look at at all  has a nice piercing smell of sweet corn and a lager type aroma very malty grainy and lemony ok on the nose  taste has nice warmish mouthfuls not a strong initial taste and a bit flat bit metallic in initial taste not nice and in overall taste as well difficult to drink to be frank  feck me this was a disgusting beer to drink i felt a bit sick drinking it its like a chemical infused beer with little thought given to flavours or tastes  beer two taste is very hoppy too hoppy too much sweet corn and all a bit sour hard to stomach especially for what is meant to be a lager all in the front end its a dead kind of taste no too hoppy for me not nice  very disappointing when you consider that sab have morphed into the worlds largest brewer of beers yet their baby castle beer is muck
2701,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,3,12oz bottle code on label reads 23046 ch2338 clear pale straw colored body thin finger of white head turns to lingering cap and ring leaves behind tendrils of lacing aroma of grain malts including corn and barley slight whiff of floral hops taste is light malts including corn slight green apple fruit sweet overall less than medium mouth feel wet and clean very good carbonation thirst quenching but very thin on the flavor profile no skunk from the green bottle but not much of a bite
2702,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2.26,hard to find in sc so when i found it in total wine i picked up a coule 18 packs abig mistake this used to be a unique and tasty brew something has changed now it seems hardly better than light beers very little smell very mild taste the only thing good is that its cold id rather have beer with some taste thats cold just my opinion
2703,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,3.46,presentation 12 ounce can poured into a pint glass  look light golden color with average head  smell sweet caramelized malt aroma moderate hops aroma and minor citrus aroma  taste strong hops flavor and minor citrus flavor nice floral aftertaste the flavor is much more distinct than i expected  feel ordinary mouthfeel feels like any other american lager  overall this beer is prominent flavors the taste is more complex than many other cheap beers very easy to drink if youre looking for a cheap beer with a unique flavor this beer is for you
2704,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2.31,poured into a glass mug pale yellow color with about an inch of white head highly carbonated and fizzed like a soda little aroma or taste got an unusual albeit brief wave of sweetness absolutely no hop influence it is highly drinkable but overly simple in character and i nda boring 6 pk bottles was 749  tax would not purchase again
2705,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2.92,pours out of bottle a pale yellow with a 1 finger head smells hoppy and crisp taste follows suit and a nice change of pace from other lagers
2706,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,4.2,im the weirdo in ky that likes this yankee beer its a nice middle ground between light beer and drinking a pork chop has good taste very little aftertaste and is awesome in bottles and ice cold will drink in can but not my fave that way was introduced in college twenty years back and got it a couple years ago for the nostalgia really liked it and have stuck with it ever since better than any light and just a few extra calories
2707,Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.19,375 ml bottle 2015 vintage purchased off shelf at state line yesterday though id seen it on the shelf there for years decanted into my sapwood wine glass  l clear rubycolored liquid with vinousviolet highlights little pop on the cork removal little foam build on pour the foam breaks down quick leaving little collar almost looks still  s cherry hard candy perfumy aromatics but not suggesting sweetness that mixed with a barrelfunky champagne tone fruit leather earthy rainsoaked terrain hint of fruit tart pastry dough fringe of smoky phenolics  t mmm much fruitier than the aromas let on cherry and red grape some dark plum as well lingering dried red fruit in the dry aftertaste much more malt depth as well the fruit portion of this is relatively bloated leaving the dying vitality of the lambic a touch buried the expressions at this age are mature but still have character  f nearly still as far as carbonation smudgy lightmedium body subtle acidic singe at the back of the palate a sipper too easy  o this may have lost a good portion of its zest and zip but its still a lovely demure drop basically drinks like an acidic near smoky moderately brightfruity mediumbodied wine lacking the boozy cut of a standardstrength vino at this stage its still tasty but it doesnt compare to the standard mariage parfait in flavor impact and i had a 2014 bottle of that recently 2228
2708,Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.09,very good cherry flavored beer drank in a teku glass had no head on it whatsoever after pouring it i wouldnt buy it again but i am glad i tried it as it was very enjoyable
2709,Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.18,375ml bottle into a teku 2014 vintage  looks good soft burgundy body small head fizzes away quite quickly no lacing  tart cherry aroma with a hint of oak  on tasting cherries much stronger than suggested by the nose tart without being drying fairly sour a touch of wood  mouth between medium and full finish tart cherry and at the very end a light dryness comes in  overall very good kriek lambic holds up very well after 8 years
2710,Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,3.59,2015 vintage pours a deep cherry red light pink 05 head that quickly settles out no lacing nose is oak must wine lees cherry and cherry wood mild lactic notes much of the fruit has sapped out of this over the years  theres an initial hit of sourness at the start but tannic oak takes over rather quickly and sticks through to the finish what is there of the fruit registers as sour cherry id also buy raspberry but its far in the background feel is great  so very smooth and drinkable the only thing keeping me from drinking quarts of the stuff is price would like to have fresh version to drink alongside to see how much the fruit is meant to shine
2711,Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.03,2011 vintage bottle 2033 best before date so guessing this is a 2013 release  pours a kind of deep purple with red hues kind of in that coca coladr pepper meets dimetapp grape vein in color that classic musty cherry character on the nose even after all of this time its incredibly fruit forward the cherry character is sweeter than i anticipated having this im wanting to get some intense red some time soon this has moderate levels of acidity and funk overall its pleasant to drink but i feel like theres less lambic character than i would like

2716,2XIPA,4.02,on tap at florida taphouse pours a pretty copper color and maintains the lacing this is all about the hops not malt just strongly piney hops when i want to be reminded what ipa is about this is a good reminder

2718,2XIPA,3.96,rich and coppery in color 2finger head great lacing made a little heart shape in the pint glass which is completely coincidential and your mileage may vary but still a nice little moment for me smells citrusypineappley the flavor is hopforward and floral with strong pine notes ive noticed a lot of popular iipas going in a very malty direction that i am not personally a big fan of this does not do that up to you whether thats a good thing unremarkable mouthfeel medium bodied and very carbonated  im happy as a clam a definite favorite for me from an otherwise eh but drinkable variety pack and very good in its own right
2719,2XIPA,4.08,12oz can dated best by 022823 poured into a pint glass shows a cloudy gold body and boasts a proud 2 head of lovely white fluffy bubbles that leaves a solid drape of lacing on the glass from top to bottom  aromas of grapefruit and pine resin match the flavor which also includes a strong biscuit malt a bitter residue remains behind  feel is full well carbonated being just short of sharp and not quite sticky  overall a classic double
2720,2XIPA,4.04,the color is strong copper and translucent with a very little offwhite head the smell is hoppy and inviting the taste is of hops and something with citrus

2722,2XIPA,3.36,smells great looks good feels great not my favorite double ipa the abv comes through too strong on this one and the alcohol overpowers the hopsfloralcitruspine dogfish 90min great lakes chillwave double dales are all preferable over this
2723,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40,4.66,bottle 330ml 2020 release  look pours black looks a bit thin good layer of brown foam  smell chocolate cacao molasses and some vanilla maybe  taste cacao vanilla malty oak and whiskey  mouthfeel a bit thin but with this abv nothing concerning  overall great beer for this style nice barrel character
2724,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40,4.34,appearance  zero head over a clear but nearly opaque dark brown body  aroma  woody sweet molasses brown sugar whiskey more prominent than many others in the series  taste  woody light molasses not as sweet as other versions light whiskey in the aftertaste  mouthfeel  smooth and slightly oily but in a good way  overall  a fitting end to the year series outstanding beer
2725,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40,3.86,pours a very dark oily brown and nearly flat not too much sediment just dark cloudy brew aroma of scotch oxidized malt cocoa smoke vanilla and oak  taste is lightly peaty with other notes of cocoa vanilla like oak whiskey and dark soy the influence of scotch barrel is still there but the beer is flat and a bit watery the mouthfeel has lingering cocoa and oaky tannins but the lack of carbonation hurts it a bit disappointing
2726,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40,3.99,bought a bottle at julians in providence ri 30 for an 112oz bottle surprised to see 2009 on the bottle 7years old  opened it up and what the fuck is that smell it kinda did smell like ola dubh  black engine oil  at first i guess the best way to describe the smell is if you took scottish whiskey and mixed it with water and dirt then let it sit for 7 years not particularly pleasant at first but extremely different and complex it grew on me  as for the look you can assume 99 flat no carbonation pitch black ola dubh thats about it  the taste was just as weird as the smell it didnt taste like whiskey with water it tasted like whiskey flavored water i dont know it didnt taste like an old ale it didnt taste like a barleywine it didnt taste like a stout one of the more different beers ive had personally at first i didnt find it too pleasant once again it grew on me the abv isnt all that high so it wasnt as complex as i would like it still insanely different really hard to describe  overall i dont know i dont know what it is what they were trying to do what its supposed to be what to compare it to i just dont know i gave it its rating based on how different and unique it is
2727,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40,4.32,330 ml bottle into snifter bottle 26077 bottled in 82010 pours fairly pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers light spotty lacing clings around the glass with some light streaming carbonation aromas of big milk chocolate cocoa coffee toast toffee molasses dark bread vanilla oak raisin plum fig peat smoke leather tobacco and oakpeat earthiness incredible complexity and balance of darkbready malt and whiskey cask notes with good strength taste of big milk chocolate cocoa coffee toast toffee dark bread molasses vanilla oak raisin plum fig peat smoke leather tobacco and roastpeat earthiness slight roastoak bitterness on the finish with lingering notes of milk chocolate cocoa coffee dark bread vanilla toffee oak dark fruit peat smoke leather tobacco and oakpeat earthiness on the finish for a while incredible complexity and balance of darkbready malt and whiskey cask flavors with a great roasted bitternesssweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish light carbonation and mediumfull bodied with a very smooth creamy and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish overall this is an outstanding old ale all around awesome complexity and balance of darkbready malts and whiskey cask flavors and very smooth to sip on for the abv a highly enjoyable offering
2728,Golden Fern,4.41,decent head production retention and lacing  nose brings a level of dankness fairly rare for tree house  as should perhaps be expected for a beer prominently featuring new zealand hops additional notes of papaya melon white grape earth and orange  less dank on the palate although that edge is certainly still present very juicy with tasting notes of peach papaya white grape tangerine banana pear and melon  smooth and creamy but maintains a lovely bite
2729,Golden Fern,4.86,this one pours a very hazy golden yellow color with a small head and lots of lacing  this smells like peach passionfruit pineapple upside down cake white grape and melon  this is easily one of the best ipas ive had in a long time theres this fascinating guava and passionfruit thing plus an almost cake like or candied pineapple thing its not quite fully what im getting but its very reminiscent of pineapple upside down cake theres lots of nz hop character here  citrusy and exotic  this is medium bodied creamy and rich with a great drinkability  this is easily one of the best ipas ive ever had from th the hop combination here is just super dynamite
2730,Golden Fern,4.35,pours that yellowish cantaloupe color that many th dipas turn out great head retention white grape lemon lemongrass pink peppercorn on the nose white wine herbaceous lime creamy mouthfeel
2731,Golden Fern,4.48,sweet tropical hoppy prominent white wine grape hint of stonefruity apricot and a floral orange citrus nose on this one taste follows with a murkysoft malty tropical hoppy and an orangegrapefruit citrus bitter swallow yum this has an almost fidens like taste and feel to it as it warms a little more hoppy bitterness peeks out but this is a good thing i hope tree house stays in this lane really good
2732,Golden Fern,4.68,16oz can into a ddg teku  pours a hazy almost opaque and turbid yellow 2 finger thick and creamy white head stringy and spotty lace nose is melon cantaloupe white grape and unripened peach super danky and juicy beer opens white grape melon unripened peach and pineapple cane sugar honey and overripe citrus fruit in the middle dry oaky finish medium bodied with moderate carbonation soft and fluffy on the palate and goes down bone dry with a sticky sap sucking aftertaste  this beer is outrageously good a must try for sure
2733,Golden Fern,4.43,16oz can dated 72823  pours murky gold with an inchplus head of dense white plenty of tattered lacing and persistent retention dank citrus in the nose cracked garlic peach flesh dried mango medium bodied with a soft creamy mouthfeel ripe and juicy tropicals on the palate candied peach orange mango finishes rich and lush
2734,Genesee Beer,2.23,had this out of a 12oz can into a pint glass at tims place in st albans vt  pale yellow not much head no lacing  bready sweet arona  taste is too sweet corny almost artificial sweet  thin high carbonation sweet aftertaste  this was a disappointment most other aals are better
2735,Genesee Beer,2.94,12 oz can poured into a pilsner glass on a hot summer night look is clear pale yellowgold white head pours thick and then falls off to a thin cap smell is grain corn grass taste is bitter up front then sweet malt corn and grain finish it up a pretty clean finish is left behind as it warms it gets hard to drink as it starts to take on some off flavors feel is light well carbonated clean in the end overall i was surprised how much i liked this one its got to remain cold or it becomes tough to drink nice and cheap for the 30 pack a bit sweet tasting but im good with that this is going to be a new staple in the fridge
2736,Genesee Beer,1.93,not much to say its beer
2737,Genesee Beer,2.82,pours a pale yellow producing a small finger of white foam that quickly settles the smell is malty with a hint of mild perfume the taste is slightly sweet and perfumelike with a touch of corn a light easy drinking feel  overall not bad and the price is cheap at 1430rack i prefer high life or hamms over this but i wouldnt turn it down on a hot day
2738,Genesee Beer,1.92,a little too sweet for my liking it was a very popular and respected beer in centralupstate new york in my area it was probably the best selling draft beer for a long long time i am in the minority in my region for not really finding this beer good
2739,Genesee Beer,3.61,it tastes good aint real expensive and it tastes good
2740,Genesee Beer,3.25,this ones a real high school memory beer back in the day this was one of our favorite beers it was cheap and we could always get it and it was good still not too bad but you definitely want to drink it ice cold enjoy
2741,Genesee Beer,3.1,its not offensive i finished up mowing the lawn and it was perfect i wouldnt serve it any other way besides ice cold not for beer snobs
2742,Genesee Beer,2.87,poured from an undated 12oz can into my pils glass  on the pour a light 2 finger fine head forms then over the course of a couple minutes it dissipates to a ring around the glass the body is a light golden straw with relatively lazy carbonation for the style no lacing  aroma is quite malty with some nice crackery notes and the yeast is also quite detectable but in a slightly estery generically beery sort of way everything smells very light there is a slight hint of grassy herbal hops for the style this isnt half bad as the beer warms diacetyl does become noticable  flavor is quite similar to the aroma but with some detectable adjunct sweetness hop bitterness is present but vague and the malt is quite sweet again once the beer warms diacetyl is present keep this one cold and probably dont pour it into a pils glass  feel is crisp with a high carbonation bite and a nice foamy head to make the beer feel softer this is a very cheap beer and for the price it could be a whole lot worse its pretty dang drinkable  overall this is a cheap full flavor lager that isnt terrible with a nice malty character there is some off but as long as it stays cold its a pretty good budget option
2743,Genesee Beer,2.86,they said ohtani couldnt do it in the manor leagues they said orson welles couldnt eat 30 hot dogs in one sitting from pinks they said nicola tesla was a quack and they said raul wouldnt like genesee but not only does raul he genesees through all the haters  get some  ok maybe genesee is now sliding all of a sudden the word play doh seems appropriate
2744,Genesee Beer,1.09,in any category this watery corned water is probably the lamest beer ive ever had in 40 plus years of drinking beer head is gone instantly no aromas very little cornish hint of flavor no hops noticed flat as a fart in under five minutes i expected it to be a mainstream cheap crap lager and it was worse than i expected
2745,Genesee Beer,4.25,this is a very good regional beer that actually tastes like a real beer
2746,Genesee Beer,3.75,poured from a 16 oz can purchased at 802 store in arlington vt pours light yellow with very light head stale adjunct corn taste with slight carbonation for what it is its not terrible decent garage beer
2747,Genesee Beer,3.6,the beer of my youth i was weaned on gennys nipple best beer ever but seriously its a decent regional favorite that rinses down hot dogs on a summer afternoon how about that nostalgic 5 i gave it overall bam
2748,Genesee Beer,3.36,being from northeastern ohio this has been a staple of my beer consuming years genesee is not a complex lager and is an easy drinking beer there are no off setting flavors to speak of and its simplicity makes it very drinkable barley malt yes corn grits because thats what american and canadian brewers use to brew for the masses and then finally hops genesee red eye doesnt have the off putting vegetable oil flavor of mhl or the wet carboard flavor of ab you can drink 1 or 6 the flavor is consistent and if your in the mood for a boiler maker this is the perfect choice hands down
2749,The Greenest Green,4.6,pours a milky yellow orange with a fluffy offwhite head taste is sweeter than some of the other members of the green family but thats countered by a pithy bitterness that bitterness is less immediate than other greens but seems more longlasting maybe due to the creamy mouthcoating body  overall a beautifully done treehouse dipa
2750,The Greenest Green,4.9,175 yummy
2751,The Greenest Green,4.53,this one pours a very hazy glowing orange color with a small head and lots of lacing  theres a ton of funky and sweet pineapple on the nose here some tropical fruit orange tangerine and just the lightest floral aroma  green is a perennial favorite from tree house and this is the stickiest and most greentastic version of that ive had yet its just super saturated and thick with hop character without tasting syrupy theres loads of the expected pineapple and mango here with tons of orange and tangerine citrus and very little bitterness its just got that extra little push beyond green or very green  its not a full on uppercut but its definitely a hard shove  this is thick and creamy with a wonderful drinkability and no hint at all of the 88 abv  its honestly old hat at this point this is wonderful of course it is tree house has come out of the other side of their expansion extremely successfully
2752,The Greenest Green,4.49,serving can canned jul272023 consumed aug132023  pours an orangey yellow with lots of haze and a middling white head little lacing nose is pineapple and bitter orange resiny oils little detectable malt presence the flavor is a wee little burst of the rinds of those fruits followed by a big but shortlived wave of those same fruits but this time just their bitter oily perfumey aromatics this then dissipates into a lingering bitter hop buzz and not much else the mouthfeel is less of that classic round fluffy juiciness and more total hop saturation that said it is quite pleasant and doesnt venture into sappy or hop burny or astringent territory as it warms some of the hoppyyeasty estery sweetness as well as a scoche of malt character come out but even then it is a onetwothree punch thats a thing right of the two main facets of the hops sweetbitterbittersweetbitter in quick succession regardless of any way the the beer could be better this back and forth shift with ever sip is extremely enjoyable and impressive to have pulled off from a brewing perspective  in looking through my reviews of a few of its predecessors i can see how it is a clear extension of them the main thing i notice is that in previous ampedup versions the fruity sweetness held its own and offered a foil to the bitter resinous palate shellac potential contained within the hop profile  in this particular beer though the bitter oiliness has overtaken the rest and i have to really seek out the nonbitter aspects of it  they say on the can that this is a result of their series to see how far they could push the envelope before it was too much yeah i could see that interesting to have this bitter of a treehouse beer  42545454545
2753,The Greenest Green,4.22,tried in hyannis 8823
2754,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,1.43,the bottle the pour and the presentation are fine however there is an offputting taste that i cant quite put my finger onalmost reminds me of eggssour sort of skunky tasting possibly in and out of refrigeration too many times the bartender jokingly said cat urine who knows im sorry but i do not recommend this beer at all becks can definitely do better
2755,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,1.86,why does this taste so much like tea leaves isnt this just supposed to be an na lager like heineken 00 idk i realize im not into na beers but i will not be trying this again
2756,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,1.25,sept 2002 fizzy straw coloured water with some unpleasant metallic bitterness i cant believe i actually paid for this insipid and uninteresting na beer
2757,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,2.89,had with a meal in germany as there were no real beers in the house and i had never tried an na beer before frankly its a bit bizarre and theres definitely something missing tastewise that being said its not bad at all i just have no desire to drink another one
2758,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.63,pours a crystal clear golden color thick 34 finger sudsy white head forms on the beer before dissipating thin layer of velvety foam remains on the top of the beer aroma has notes of sweet grains a slight skunkiness light herbal hops again its very reminiscent of a becks  taste follows the nose with notes of sweet grainy malts a moderate skunkiness that becomes more pronounced as it warms up there is a very light wortiness to the profile but its very subtle feel is light crisp easy drinking bright carbonation  this is a solid na version of the regular beer
2759,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,2.77,this is my entrylevel na i wont purchase sharps odouls or coors edge if becks na is all the store or restaurant has then ill go with it it can pair okay with most foods because it doesnt have an overwhelming taste profile
2760,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.62,pours clear gold in color with one quarter inch head taste is cereal grain and white sugar light body moderate carbonation sweet good for an old school macro style non alcoholic beer very clean and sessionable
2761,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.46,pours a translucent pale yellow with a finger of white foam aroma is dank like walking into a backwoods dispensary dank aside from the dank is light resiny hops and pale malts but really its just dank flavor profile is you guessed it hella dank its dank from top to bottom with a little resiny hops and pale malts for some extra depth mouth feel is crisp with thin consistency leading to a refreshing sip overall dank cant be understated here but otherwise a refreshing glass of na beer  served in a chilled pint from a bottle
2762,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,1.83,pours a clear transparent straw colour with very small head and minimal lacing  smell is pretty unremarkable slightly malty but not much else there  tastes of slight malts and skinniness but the taste is very faint tastes like a very watered down version of their regular beer  not a great na beer if youre skimping on the alcohol id reach for a higher quality de alcolized brew
2763,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,1.27,poured from a bottle  pale yellow straw color with quickly dissipating fluffy white head leaving moderate frosty lacing looks like fizzy yellow beernose is mildly skunky with a faint hint of some unidentifiable smellmoldy grass clippings or decomposing vegetables or spoiled fermenting grain taste is dilutedwatery and skunky a weak attempt at capturing what beer tastes like i dont know why anyone would drink this terrible
2764,Hofbr√§u Oktoberfestbier,4.72,one of my favorite oktoberfest beers you cannot go wrong with hofbrau house tastes great with a little bitterness definitely in my top 3 i buy every year

2766,Hofbr√§u Oktoberfestbier,4.7,out of that wacky 112 oz ie wheres my last sip bottle first off im a big dark lager guy so this is a bit out of my regular wheelhouse who the hell made wheelhouse up for us all cause i cant find the rest of the boat this ocktoberfestbier is a real winner however in the category just the best bread like taste complimented properly by enough hops the carb was a little lively for a bit but settled in with some patience color is the attractive golden hue expected i like it much more than any other so far and i thought sierra nevadas collab octoberfest was pretty decent i normally wouldnt drink more than one of this type due to personal preference but dang if they didnt really hit a homer here im about to open number two
2767,Hofbr√§u Oktoberfestbier,4.02,clear golden amber with plenty of foam in the chalice this is just what i hope for in the oktoberfest style warm and malty but not too sweet and tangy with that kiss of hops this one is mellow as well as spritzy with a tangy finish from the 330 ml bottle im not going to try to decipher the date code as it tastes fresh enough
2768,Hofbr√§u Oktoberfestbier,3.97,tapped from a 5 liter can clear pale gold with huge foamy white head leaving significant lacing nose is floral and bready taste follows with a mild bitterness that lingers on the finish crisp and clean easy quaffer

2770,Hofbr√§u Oktoberfestbier,4.61,2023 vintage appearance brilliant pale gold frothy white head with great retention medium carbonation  aroma floral hops bready malt  flavor  aftertaste doughy biscuity malt spicy hops moderate to low bitterness dry a little alcohol warming pokes through  mouthfeel medium bodied drying moderate length aftertaste  overall first festbier of 2023 season this is not quite as good as 2022 and there is a noticeable difference as i am comparing side by side it is noticeably lighter and color and has a little less body hop aroma is floral with spicy flavor malt is more biscuity quite dry and alcohol warmth is noticeable overall a good quality festbier very drinkable even at 63 abv  2022 vintage appearance brilliant deep gold frothy white head with great retention  aroma floral and herbal hops bready malt  flavor and aftertaste spicy hops and grainy bready malt restrained bitterness semidry alcohol well hidden  mouthfeel medium to full bodied dry at the finish medium length finish  overall i found this to be one of the best festbiers of the season simply world class complex malt yet very drinkable
2771,Parabola,4.74,poured from a bottle 2023 vintage   appearance  body is black as the night with a dark brown short head that disappears into some wispy bubbles the dark brown head was expected and didnt disappoint  smell  malty and molasses chocolatey and some boozy bourbon hints not overpowering but pleasant  taste malty right away some coffee tones and darker fruits smooth chocolate finish with some mild hints of booze great taste and pleasantly surprised by the subdued alcohol boozy presence throughout the sampling very rich beer  feel lower carbonation minimal boozy sting and a lighter body than expected  overall  great beer that i feel privileged to try i couldnt drink many of these in one sitting as they are pretty rich but a very enjoyable beer everyone should sample
2772,Parabola,4.63,2011 edition from the bottle at home with humiston just great all around

2774,Parabola,4.69,poured from the bottle into a cool tulip glass 2023 vintage consumed at approx 50 degrees f  l solid jet black very slight desaturated brown head s strong sweet chocolate nose a bit of something like caramel and even some coconut a bit of booze t dark coffee and chocolate brownie not terribly sweet again something akin to lightly toasted coconut flakes surprisingly there seems to be some more acidity than i was expecting big boozy finish f a bit lighter than expected but still fairly heavy slight carbonation moderately warming o a brighter stout than i was expecting but still fantastic just the right amount of warmth and plenty of rich dark and sweet flavors to play with one of the best stouts ive had
2775,Parabola,4.55,2021 vintage pours a very dark cola brown halfinch tan collar of head that leaves wisps of lacing nose is big on whiskey and rye along with wood vanilla char licorice molasses brown sugar aromas really gel and round at as it warms flavor is equally complex  lots of spice from the rye sweet molasses wood canadian whiskey light vanilla sugar in the raw it manages to avoid becoming an overly boozy nightmare while still highlighting the spirit barrels all without loading up on sugars and adjuncts mouthfeel is thick and chewy though not so much as bcbs theres also some light carb as well pretty exceptional
2776,Parabola,4.37,12 ounce bottle poured into a snulip 2023 release  l clear dark brown and oily has legs half inch of redhued light brown head recedes to a tight creamy foam ring s bourbon barrel fairly strong alcohol as it warms notes of fig and molasseslike dark sugars come out t bourbon barrel and alcohol roasted malt bitter dark chocolate notes of dark fruit finishes with a woody hop tang f mediumfull body medium carbonation smooth and creamy small viscous oat feel finishes with some heat o a big sipping ris a little hot the alcohol character dominates still really good

2779,Parabola,2.9,2022 it didnt taste like a russian imperial stout to me too sweet in fact i think rasputin is a better representative and forget about comparing it to sam smiths ris i was thankful the bourbon still came through strong which did a lot for the taste i think the most noticeable things about this beer are its abv of 141 and its weight both of which put it in the oneanddone categoryand thats if you can finish the 12 oz bottle which i was barely able to do after about 2 hours from the time i poured it the abv and the weight really work against the enjoyability of this beer
2780,Parabola,4.63,drinking a 2017 which ive had in the cellar i am not an expert on the true evaluation of the ris but i fell in love with this one after my first trip to firestonewalker in el paso de robles about 12 or 13 years ago this started me on ris style fw have a cellar room where you can buy the good stuff i recommend a visit as the wine country out there is fabulous and fw is affiliated with many of the wineries sourcing casks mixers etc the beer is complex and has so many taste notes to it that i wont try to guess them all it should satisfy almost anyone i highly recommend putting one away for a few years i have a few more tonight my wife is celebrating her 60th and i will be having a 5 year old deschutes abyss or two after the tomahawk ribeye bbq tonight but for now nothing better to set off this great celebration than my all time favorite parabola
2781,Parabola,4.65,2021 vintage 12 ounce bottle poured at 53 into a firestone walker snifter perfect brown head rises above a deep black sea and leaves a nice ring inside the glass drizzly lacing smells wonderful  dark malt chocolate coffee prune licorice barrel char drinking like a millionaire all of the aromas spill forth into the mouth and everybody takes a bow multiple barrels makes for a tasters experience the peppery spice of the rye barrel carries long which helps cut into the sweet elements of this russian imperial stout vanilla fudge barrel on and on feel is not overly dense which i appreciate medium carbonation overall  world class stout and totally worthy the art of the craft
2782,Icehouse,1.97,i try to see the good in every beer i think its amazing that this can of slightly fizzy and tasteless water stands at 55 abv i just chugged a 24 oz can and feel very cheatedlol live and learn the promise of bolder taste makes me wonder how dishonest the people are who have marketed this extremely tasteless beer
2783,Icehouse,4,its a budget beerno surprises im not a beer snob and just wanted an inexpensive beer no fancy verbiage or hoity toity reviewsfeel notes of oak and no get outta here with that stuff serious its beer tastes like beer and it went fine with the food i ate plus it led me to investigate what ice beer is so i also learned something againbargain beer that really aint bad thats a 4 for me  will purchase again
2784,Icehouse,3,the taste is a bit offensive but still drinkable lets be honest here if you are buying an ice beer you are buying it to get as drunk as possible while spending as little money as possible and there is nothing wrong with that  style ice lager  tapcanbottle can  abv 55  rating 3
2785,Icehouse,4,solid budget option im not sure why it has such bad reviews for the style its good its not like were reviewing a craft beer here
2786,Icehouse,4.33,24oz tallboy  clear goldenyellow with a sticky bit of foam smells like sweet corn and the taste matches malt and corn syrup with hints of grass machinery bittering hops pepper mostly in that order  criminally underrated on here cheap and clean  destroys most modern adjunct lagers
2787,Icehouse,3.39,honestly not bad its cheap and good classic taste better than budweiser or coors in my opinion
2788,Icehouse,4.03,i am a craft beer snobipa is my middle name we all know this is a cheap beerfor guys from the seventieseightieswe remember actually enjoying bud or old milwaukeeicehouseimois that throwback beermade in 1993 that still has that taste that i rememberive tried all the cheapo beers recentlyand they basically suckincluding bud and old milwaukeeyatheyve changed the recipesthats a known facttrying to appeal to todays manand saving a buck or two on productionicehouse has the tasteflavorandyesi will say it with pridethe corn smell we all grew up with and lovedits 55 abvwhich is a sweet spot between the usual 47 of domesticsand the 65 and above of craft beers if you want to understand why your dad loved bud back in the daytry icehouse with an open mindits mildsmoothand will help you bond with the old manlisten to his storieshe wont be around forever
2789,Icehouse,2.12,pours out of the can a crystal clear gold with 2 fingers of fizzy head that dissipates within a minute smells grainy and slightly metallic tastes pretty simple not metallic like the smell easy drinking honestly id be just as likely to get this as lite or milwaukees best ice not really too bad
2790,Icehouse,1.63,its nostalgic because ive been drinking it since i was a kid 30 years or so now of course its trash but if you only got some change a dollar bill and a little bit on your debit card to combine all into one walmart purchase its better than nuttin
2791,Icehouse,2.64,poured from a 24oz can best by nov 7th 2022  on the pour an impressive mostly fine woth some fizz 4 finger head forms then has enough retention to only lose a finger a minute the head does become more fizzy and rocky however amd carbonation is very high in the light golden body  aroma is pretty meh cheap lager tartness on a relatively decent corn and malt base but the cheap ick is there not the cleanest slight metallic note  taste is actually nice for an ice beer its sortof like light colt 45 or something but with a bit of that cheap ick malty corny and surprisingly light there wants to be bitterness but it fades fast and im not sure if its alcohol or hops  feel is light but mouthcoating quite drinkable and refreshing this beer is one of the most chuggable ice beers ive had short finish on the main flavors but a light mouthcoating sweet corn adjunct sticks around for a while  overall i was expecting worse for an ice beer its not bad but still colt 45 is better if you want cheap above 5 but mhl is still the king
2792,Fundamental Forces,4.25,100 rating like george burnes on a cigar here we go large and in charge like veronica lake after a martin or three lets ride more solid than robert taylor as ivanhoe god save the king
2793,Fundamental Forces,4.54,for the 2021 version sweet and rich chocolate malty hint of vanilla and hint of bourbon barrel nose on this one taste follows with a dark chocolate bitter floral vanilla and balanced boozy bourbon finish a slight hint of ageoxidation can be detected on the backend but this has agedsettled in extremely well for being about a year old the bigboi booziness that you would expect at 17 is there but it is smooth and enjoyableit starts to peek out a bit more as it warms and the mouthfeel is darn near perfect outstanding
2794,Fundamental Forces,4.51,look  black thick syrup with slight rimming and lacing barely a head smell  a lot of vanilla bourbon barrel chocolate and booze taste  lots of vanilla chocolate great barrel feel  full body creamy light carb overall  really great beer
2795,Fundamental Forces,4.79,fundamental forces is an imperial vanilla stout from bottle logic the one i drank had an abv 1717 so a little stronger i guess the fundamental force i got was the strong nuclear force the one with gluons and mesons its recommended with brownies i didnt have brownies but my wife suggested oreo cookies but i thought that i didnt need to double it up this beer is like 8 oreo cookies and thats enough maybe a little sweet but its good very good slightly boozy well abv 1717 but with all the other flavors that is not an issue  look black with a half inch fluffy mocca colored head  aroma chocolate vanilla bourbon  flavor what stands out is the vanilla the bourbon the roasted malts the coffee and chocolate  bodyoverall full bodied dessert in a bottle
2796,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.14,copper to brown in color with a murky complexion theres a quarter inch of khaki brown on top the aroma is of delicious smoked malt im tasting that bold smoked malt flavor but this one is a bit more subtle than some of their other ones the mouth is moderately carbonated and that smokey taste lingers after the finish
2797,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),2.86,look dark brown with a cream head  smell smokey malty some hops  taste smoke charcol malt  feel small bubbles prickly
2798,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.46,my first ever a recent acquisition from a trip out of state as its not sold here  a longtime want and it does not disappoint  of the 5 beers ive had from this brewer this one comes real close to the best ive had  a 2012 bottle of the dopplebock that i enjoyed on easter day this past spring
2799,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.1,20230618 500ml can served in a snulip can is apparently not dated  pours a murky dark brown with a smallish head and a moderate amount of carbonation settles into a mediumthickness ring sustained by said carbonation and a swirling dusting on the surface smell is smoke nuts and toffee  taste is similar  not as smoky as some other aecht schlenkerlas i have had but quite smokey toffee and maybe horehound  root flavor in addition to the nuts moderate barky bitterness  mouthfeel is light smooth overall very nice rauchbier
2800,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.09,pours a murky copper color with a medium top of beige head that dissolves slowly aroma is of smoked malt smoked ham firewood with some notes of leather dark bread and caramel the flavour is malty with some slight sweet notes i sense dark bread with some toffee notes allong with the smoked notes of smoked ham the finish has some slight bitterness in it as well as some salty feel mouthfeel is suprisingly smooth with a medium carbonation and a medium body all in all a very good take on this rauchbier a little less smoky than the other rauchbiers from this brewery
2801,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.15,500ml bottle poured out a murky dark amber color with a small khakicolored head of foam it left sudsy trails of lace on the glass it smelled of smoked malt caramel toffee and wood great smoke taste with bready malt toffee and caramel
2802,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.1,116oz can into a pint glass no freshness dating  nice smoky aroma stronger in the taste with a side of bacon smooth finish
2803,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.21,lightly clouded bronze appearance with a creamy dense off white head and very nice lacing the smoky aroma with hints of leather was relatively mild in comparison to the urbock full bodied mouthfeel with an earthy peaty flavor modest to average carbonation decently hopped but not as intense as some of the other schlenkerlas like comparing an ipa to a iipa good one to have if its your first smoked beer everything falls into place from appearance to finish
2804,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.25,i had this on draft 32123  the hopleaf  mostly opaque brownorange appearance  nice offwhite head frothy lace  candied bacon campfire smoke  faint berry notes in the nose  medium mouthfeel  candied bacon campfire smoke  faint berry flavors  big bold but with a nice sweetness to balance the smoke id have another
2805,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.15,pours a deep rich mahogany i get some creme br√ªl√©eburnt marshmallow on the nose there is definitely a burnt sugar quality that carries through an underpinning of smoked malt this is less hammy than your usual schlenkerla profile in fact im not sure it has much smoked meat character at all this feels like the smoked beer for the nonmeat eater if there ever was one
2806,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.25,delicious beer really is so so cool as well very little else like it obviously smokey flavours are dominating here smoked meats cigar smoke burned toast theres a saltiness to it but also a vanilla sweetness some brown bread malt herbal low to medium bitterness on the finish medium to full bodied with medium carbonation thick enough its such a fun beer in such a fun style
2807,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.71,canned 042022  l the beer pours a medium to deep amber color with good clarity the pour results in two fingers of khaki head with good retention as the beer goes down it leaves a mass of ringed and webbed lacing on the glass  s the initial impression is smoked meats but after the beer has had a chance to sit in the glass this fades almost completely further investigation reveals smoked beechwood and malt with a roasted grain character coming through the smokiness caramel malt a touch of honey bread crust and a very light earthy herbal character  t i get smoked malts and a touch of beechwood fairly restrained compared to the nose caramel sweetness a nice bready malt character notes of dark fruits a bit of brown sugar and an earthy herbal presence on the backend and finish presenting notes of black tea and fresh cut hay on the finish there is a nice light bitterness and a minimal hint of noble hop spice complemented by notes of burnt beechwood and dark earth as the beer warms it sweetens up and the dark fruits come out more in the form of fig and raisin notes  f medium to mediumfull body with medium carbonation the mouthfeel is smooth on the front end but quickly turns a bit sticky coating the palate as it goes down the finish has a delightful light dryness that keeps me coming back for another drink  o this is a world class rauchbier definitely malt forward but the hops come in on the backend and finish keeping the sweetness in check and lending a nice earthy bitterness that keeps this one from being too cloy as it warms it edges up to cloyness but never steps over the line for some reason i only get smoked meats on the initial pour of the first can but after a minute or two its completely gone the mouthfeel is amazing and keeps me coming back to the glasshighly drinkable and highly recommended  on a final note i have to give props to b united and oec for their partnership with brauerei hellertrum their tank container canning project gives us here in the states a chance to drink fresh german beer which is a nice turn after my personal journey of trying to decipher german production codes with lots of assists from the ba german production code thread
2808,Curmudgeon,4.12,a 2016 version poured out of a 32oz crowler that i picked up  sll in sept 21 ive always enjoyed this beer fresh and cold but leaving this beer out and sipping my way through it was great for exposing the beers full spectrum of aromas and flavors this is one of the most inviting beers if based on looks alone  a beautifully clear deep amber body is capped with a dense light tan head that clings to the glass as it slowly recedes note that the last of the crowler poured a bit murkier and more caramel colored than amber the aromas are initially dominated by a mix of over ripe orchard fruits and darker sweet dried fruits on a raisin toastlike malt base there is a hint of vanilla and a good dose of other oakbarrel bourbonlike alcohol flavors to stiffly balance this beers rich base as it warms theres nuttyhazelnut caramel and toffee notes that come forward in the taste if theres a moment where the hops shine its midfinish where they come across as mildly herbal and lightly spicy medium to fullbodied with just enough carbonation and abv to keep the beer from coming across as too heavy i havent had many old ales as of late and the english ones i remember were quite different overall for someone who really likes big complex aged ales  this beer is a standout
2809,Curmudgeon,3.83,355 ml bottle from voldby k√∏bmandsgaard abv is 98 50 ibu cloudy brown colour low beige head of poor retention sweetish malty aroma notes of caramel and oak hints of dark dried fruits and alcohol not as sweet flavour as i feared malty and oaky caramel and dried figs well balanced with the hops a nice bitterness in the finish and aftertaste would buy again
2810,Curmudgeon,4.5,just about as beautiful a brew can be a request for a pint came from a tap in a clear glass vessel the color is a dark copper bright yet not translucent the head is just barely biege enduring and contributes to some wonderful glass lacing the aroma is malty almost stoutlike malty this is also good inside the mouth its rich sweet smooth and malty but thats not all molasses and hops bring an earthiness that without being bitter enhance what would make a good ale like a wee heavy scottish ale the almost 10 abv is unnoticed that its on the heavy side is a good thing for any lighter it would go down too quickly for the overall welfare of its consumer overall complexly excellent
2811,Curmudgeon,4.45,16oz mason jar on tap from the craft beer hop shop
2812,Camo Silver Ice,2.5,24 oz can same as one in photo here 1023 0406 code naturally brewed in cursive  fancy purchased cold single somewhere in the dakotas this past week poured into a busch pint  brilliantlyclear gold liquid foam fireworks upon pour head gone in 20 sec smells like corn syrup flavored hard candy maybe approaching cough drop territory with its slightly medicinal ethanol bland expression tastes like bad malt liquor stop mixed with discarded woodchuck cider and left out on the coffee table overnight after a party ciderblast virtually no aftertaste subsequent sips taste mostly of enhanced corn liquid tainted with malt snot as far as mouthfeel its practically champagne  this is in the running for arguably the worst malt liquor thats crossed my lips its not quite the worst on second thought what a roller coaster ride these past couple days with some of the worst to the best brands ive ever had this is trash redeemed only by not having an aftertaste reminder of the trauma youve just experienced 2180
2813,Camo Silver Ice,3.69,i like malt liquor i like it rough raw and powerful not drunk powerful just punchy theres something classic downhome american about itlike a 1970 chevelle 454 and i like the price of the stuff no handcrafted pretense no installment loan required camo silver ice is affordable and flavorful if a bit sweet with no unpleasant aftertaste unlike like some malt liquors and camo silver ice is plenty potent drink it fast and one might wish one hadnt frankly this brew might merit a 50 if it had a little less alcohol so the malt flavor wasnt overpowered by ethanol dark gold thick and punchyan ice cold can of camo can last the evening if sipped rather than slammed sip it in good company slam it at ones peril good stuff rock on
2814,Camo Silver Ice,3.41,24 ounce can into lager glass no can dating 0170 1459 can code pours slightly hazycloudy medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger densecreamy head with great retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation aromas of lemon cracker corn white bread dough and lightly toasted biscuit with lighter notes of wood pepper and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness a bit too fruity corn aromas but not overwhelming okay aromas with pale maltcorn and lightmoderate earthy hop notes with solid strength taste of lemon cracker corn white bread dough and lightly toasted biscuit with lighter notes of wood pepper and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness lightmoderate herbal woody floral grassy spicy bitterness on the finish lingering notes of lemon cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit wood pepper and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit nice robustness and balance of pale maltcorn and lightmoderate earthy hop flavors with a great maltbitterness balance and no cloyingastringent flavors after the finish nicely clean lager flavors not overly fruityyeasty lightmoderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and spicy alcohol medium carbonation and mediumplus body with a creamybreadygrainy and fairly crispsticky mouthfeel that is good a tad rough but smooth to sip on mild increasing warmth of 106 with minimal lingering booze after the finish overall this is a solid high gravity malt liquor all around good robustness and balance of pale maltcorn and lightmoderate earthy hop flavors smooth easy and fairly crisp to sip on slowly with the mellowly bitterspicydrying finish nicely cleanrich pils maltgrain showcase with nice earthy hop presencebalance for the style not overwhelming on adjuncts not quite the jet fuel i expected it is quite drinkable a fairly enjoyable offering for what it was
2815,Camo Silver Ice,2.34,after the first few sips it gets slightly better but still pretty rough
2816,Camo Silver Ice,2.3,drank from a glass 40 ounce bottle scores are based on the style  look  label looks like it was made in microsoft word i somehow doubt it was ice brewed for extra smooth taste probably just for more alcohol the 106 is not nearly as advertised as i thought it would be the beer itself is a decent golden color looks better than some other offerings  smell  immediately after opening strong wafts of sweet corn and wet grains nothing too special but nothing bad  taste  a surprising first hint of sweet and pleasant caramel malt but immediately overpowered by a strong alcohol flavor if it was a lower percentage it might actually be good  feel  carbonation and body are fine but the alcohol burn is mighty powerful your throat will sting and your sinuses will be cleared  overall  the icarus of malt liquors it could be something good if it wasnt trying to kill you but instead it flies too close to the sun of having all the alcohol for the least amount of money
2817,Camo Silver Ice,3.94,camo silver ice 40 is a tasty malt made to sip slow and enjoy the levels of the buzz it gives you each time you take a snag at it it gets me where i want to go and i do enjoy the taste when very very cold
2818,Camo Silver Ice,2.16,24 fl oz can  d  not recommended
2819,Camo Silver Ice,4.37,id never consume this now but in college its a cheap beer to get you wasted so it deserves a high score because it achieves the level of its intention
2820,Camo Silver Ice,1.22,where to start uh ok no prelude lets just get to it  look  something is off here it pours a golden color not unlike a macro adjunct but it has a haze to it that just doesnt seem to be right remember buffalo bill from silence of the lambs yeah looks kinda like that upgraded from 1 to 125 as it does have some fast dissipating head that settles into a surprisingly nice little foam ring  smell  nothing no im serious literally nothing had to bring my wife over and ask for verification she said she got something but it was very subtle once it warms a bit it does get somewhat of sweet grain odor but it never really develops a proper smell  taste  naturally brewed my a there aint nothing natural about this s prior to the first sip i ran in place a bit like when a god fearing human being sees a wasp on the patio fear and anxiety ensued however tasting in wasnt quite as bad as confronting the evil that is the wasp seriously one of gods sick little jokes while this is one step away from worshiping the devil it does develop some adjunct flavor as it warms i never thought id appreciate grainy corny adjunct nastiness but it was a nice distraction from the actual flavor of this beer  side note  many have complained about the booziness of this beer i honestly cannot taste the alcohol even at 106 over the overall yucky blah in this socalled lager  feel  its carbonated i think  overall  i feel like i need a bible an old priest and a young priest the fact that i drank 24 oz of this is proof that i am not living right with jesus
2821,Camo Silver Ice,1.62,grabbed it just to see how bad it was even as a poor college kid there is better beer i fan afford i think budweiser is much better thats saying something drank a victory moon glow and firestone walker wookey jack to clease the palate d
2822,Camo Silver Ice,1.08, fortune favors the bold   yeahwell see about that  l  poured see through piss yellow without any trace of a head  s  this one smelled like some booze not good booze either more of the kinda booze that leaves an ever present headache of bastard children after a one night stand turns into an unwantedcomittment and a shotgun wedding type of booze  t  tases like grain alcohol had geschlechsverkher with a stalk of pesticide ridden corn  f  numbing at least  o  this may rival steel reserve in terms of worst beer ive ever consumed
2823,Camo Silver Ice,1.62,it does exactly what you want it to do i picked up three of these for 7 and just one of them got me to a real good place its not for enjoying
2824,Camo Silver Ice,1.26,in retrospect about 10 years since ive had one of these theyre terrible but i suppose theyre bearable when youre a broke college kid
2825,Camo Silver Ice,1.5,high abv for 249 taste is rough does the job though
2826,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,2.33,may 2011 355 ml bottle from voldby k√∏bmandsg√•rd denmark i felt compelled to sample this beer  brazil is such a big country and i was kind of shameful for not having sampled any of their beers previously  abv is 45 very pale yellow colour moderate white head sweetish sugary and grainy aroma hints of maize  but not awful bland and dusty flavour fairly dry and thus kind of refreshing when ice cold but the bitterness is very low and there are hardly any flavour elements worth mentioning utterly forgettable for the sake of brazilian beer entusiasts if they exist i do hope you have access to better beers than this
2827,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,3.29,not very complex but simple good flavor and easy drinking good beer for a hot day
2828,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,3.45,12oz bottle coded j048 1543 poured into a pilsner glass at fridge temp 47 abv per label the beer pours bright light straw yellow with off white head the head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing the aroma is faint with light malt grain and very slight lager yeast the taste is grainy malt with a touch of sour a tiny bit of grassy hops ending with a mildly bitter barely vegetable finish the mouthfeel is thin bodied highly carbonated and mostly dry in the finish no glaring off flavors or flaws overall ok as a german pilsner it would be very good as an aal but im not sure there are any brewing adjuncts used in the production tastes like maybe all 2row barley this beer was actually bottled by cervejas premium do brazil st john nb canada and imported by wwweurobrewscom
2829,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,2.89,this beer is better than your average macro brew cheers c
2830,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,2.16,l clear honey gold color with almost no head or lacing  s toasted cracker malt notes of apple and some slightly skunky hops and corn  t sweet apple some corn and a little malt tastes a little watery not much flavor  f light body and clean with higher carbonation  o this is your typical tropical beach lager light without much flavor
2831,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,3.51,im really digging this wild palmnice drinkability with a full bodied finish pretty decent for a light brew
2832,Porter,4.5,a dry crisp and hoppy rendition of the style the aroma is very complex with roasted coffee dark crusty bread and burnt sugar notes being complimented with a substantial herbal and spicy hop character the taste has more of the same with a spicy bittersweet chocolate finish a very unique drinking experience by todays standards with the style moving away from bitter flavors and more into sweet flavors in most examples too bad this one is not widely available these days this is classic westcoast beer at its best
2833,Porter,3.68,draught pint at the brass tap here in baltimore
2834,Porter,3.83,oxblood with a thin ribbon of off white foam cocoa powder brown bread and salted peanuts on the nose salted caramel brown toast hazelnuts chicory coffee kola nut  slight licorice light twiggy hopping to end light clean salty tightening bitterness  375 375 375 4 4  dec 30 20 bottling date  6 months old much more like an english brown porter aside from the bitterness than most american porters roasty notes are low in favor of nutty bready malts theres also a thread of that chico yeastiness throughout what saves it is the body light and fizzy enough to be sessionable but with a creaminess that makes it satisfying  a solid beer but get edmund fitzgerald for that classic american porter profile  lighter fizzier sweeter nuttier more balanced less hoppy cleaner and more sessionable than sierra nevada stout
2835,Porter,3.89,12 oz bottle dated 61820  clear translucent brown ale with two fingers fine tan head full head and lacing roast malt gingerbread earthy yeast aromas explode out of the bottle nutty sweet roast malt light hop kick light char coffee flavors deepening as the glass warms a yeast flavor that i seem to experience in a number of sierra nevada beers light hop bitterness medium feel lasting carbonation substantial depth of flavors in a 5  abv ale very pleasant
2836,Porter,3.71,nice roasty malt up front with some sweet earthiness mixed in it has a light mouthfeel with lots of carbonation and a mild bitter end the finish drops off quickly  too quickly actually it really is a nice porter but overall its too light could be so much more
2837,Porter,3.47,pours a dark coffee brown ruby hues and a creamy tan head aromas are fairly muted a roasted malt profile is there but i cant really pick anything definitive flavors include roasty malt notes of coffee raw cocoa and earthy nuttiness trademark sn floral hop bite makes a subtle appearance on the back end mild carbonation lingering bitterness on the palate  its good for sure not extraordinary or anything as with any beer freshness is everything i would love to get some of this closer to the source to see the contrast in the flavors
2838,Porter,4,pours dark with a coffee note to it little head with a little light that gets through chocolate coffee flavors upfront sweet finish
2839,Porter,3.21,had this one in a blind taste test recently with 3 other porters and it just did not stack up the look was different the carbonation was different the taste was bland in comparison not as good as i remembered
2840,Porter,4.1,look dark brown almost black on the pour and deep rubyred when held to light with a frothy light tan head that settles slowly leaving good lacing aroma roasted barley chocolate notes toasted nuts warm brown bread and some earthiness taste roast is the highlighted theme here tons of roasted barley nuttiness and even a light roasted coffee bean note hit hard up front and as those begin to subside chocolate joins the mix more roast goodness and earthy notes take hold and lead to the finish mouthfeel full bodied smooth mediumhigh carbonation and smooth but slightly sharp on the finish from either the earthy hops or strong roast notes overall this is tasty stuff i hadnt had this beer in almost two years as only one spot close to me has it in so when i saw bottles dated 10920 i had to revisit and glad i did a very wellmade american porter with deep and rich malt flavors and enough earthy hops to keep it balanced throw in the very full body on this as well and you have yourself a winner a classic and delicious to boot
2841,Chinooker'd,4.29,shiny lighter gold color clear two finger head which recedes in a rocky fashion ample streaks of mildly chunky lace  clean aroma of fresh pale malt followed by a lighter floral hop very inviting no alcohol nose  the flavor is more bitter than the smell the malt remains solid and predictable the body is moderate while the carbonation is slightly elevated the finish is dry and peppery leaving a long pleasant aftertaste overall this is a well balanced ipa with excellent complexities a new top ipa for me
2842,Chinooker'd,4.19,draught medium goldamber color subtle medium toast malt with a subtle allspice type spice aroma with a rather floral and citrus note quite good a little bitey at first along with mellow mandarin orange peel medium roasted malt and a little tang in the middle of the taste with the citrus peel slowly fading to an easy bite
2843,Chinooker'd,3.59,enticing with all kinds of west coast beauty the clear goldamber body has a puffy offwhite foam head  this ones piney perfumey andunsurprisingly for chinook hopsmildly catty whats throwing me for a loop is just how intensely concentrated the perfumeyness is it almost seems like a glass of essential oil  the body is moderately light with a crisp then expanding froth finishing just dry and quite old school bitter
2844,Chinooker'd,4.65,can dated 811 a bit of chill haze on a light golden body nice head that provides swaths of lacing pretty dry medium light and fairly clean feel  piney and slightly vegetal nose with just a hint of grass lawn first then a little dank theres a vague and light sweetness somewhat fructose but im not connecting it to a fruit taste has a more malty edge to this sweetness but its balanced by a earthypiney bitterness grapefruit pith evolves from this opening and lingers for a short while before pine regains the ending  in the end a pith and pine ipa with a not too sweet malty opening  what i enjoy in an ipa
2845,Chinooker'd,4.11,from a can marked canned on 51121  pours into my tulip glass a clear golden shade with a frothy offwhite to ecru head some soapy lace  scent is earthy dank pungent and a bit skunky  taste is apples mint honey reminds me of a honeycrisp apple a lovely bracing bitterness creeps up as i sip  mouth is juicy and lightly oily  surprising how divergent the taste and the scent of this one are typical excellent lawsons ipa
2846,Chinooker'd,4.65,dudes be like citra this motueka that smh i just miss when ipas tasted like a mossy forest
2847,Chinooker'd,4.34,clear golden amber color visible carbonation with a dense head and lots of lacing a quick swirl and the head kicks up releasing   aromas of wet old growth forest butterscotch on oatmeal and candied orange wedges just a terrific throwback to what real ipas used to smell like rich in malt that stands up to intense hop terpenes and bitterness the flavor is an essay in balance rich caramel malt complexity blends neatly into sharp pine and grass hop flavors tongue tweaking hop bite tries to dominate but the sweet grain character keeps it all together body is a heavy medium and the finish is slightly astringent but nicely peppery and warmly boozy i have had many imperial ipas that dont have the complexity and backbone this chinookerd has
2848,Chinooker'd,4.25,canned 111720 tasted 12921 excellent american ipa i was a bit worried that i would find this too overwhelmingly bitter given the heavy chinook hop content and giant hop on the label but this turned out to be a very balanced beer rich orange color somewhat translucent with a bit of haze very appealing smell very fresh and tangy taste smooth mouthfeel and a nicely mild bitter aftertaste would happily drink this again even though its not my absolute favorite style

2859,Pannepot,4.3,july 30th 2016  a wonderful treat here with a good friend and an aged beer that might have soon been eligible for a museum complex deep and wonderful it bears a striking relationship with its cousin tasted and enjoyed back in october the smell reminds me of yakitori stands on a cold winter tokyo night and made deep with a muddy rich aroma the flavor is equally impressive and develops as a well trained orchestra with multitudinous tastes and notes acting in concert to a glorious crescendo
2860,Pannepot,3.6,1300th review something  and exotic that rather missed its high expectations l black to the eye held to a halogen its a superdark redbrown pours with a 3mm finebubble pale tan head s quite bright and vinious is this aged in wine barrels  t it definitely has a fruitywine side to it then i start wondering just wine or wine plus a hint of brandy ie its quite a pungentabvey facet f it doesnt taste like a typical belgian quad the wine edge is prominent here its all in pretty pungent one for slow sipping esp in wintercolder months o well its a tasty beer but for me the wine notes are a bit too prominent the adage from my youth was enjoy the grape winebrandy or the grain beerwhisky etc as never the two will meet ie mix them  hangover from hell and that seems to be true so beer tasting of wine is a bit strange for me this beer is from a bottle labelled on the front pannepot  special  reserva in place of the 2006  ale brewed with spices in the photo above bottled 24042018 330ml bought from bacchanalia mill road cambridgeuk 699  ouch
2861,Pannepot,4.23,2017 bottle  pours dark brown tan colored head that fades aroma of doughy bread caramel booze clove dried apricot similar flavors in the taste starts a little sweet but finishes dry a little oaky and mild tartness medium bodied
2862,Dos Equis Special Lager,3,12 oz can i dont drink from green beer bottles better than i though it would be not as good as i hoped it would be pretty balanced overall  not too bitter or sweet just the right amount of bubbles definitely one of the better adjuncts high end lawn mower beer itll definitely do when icy cold
2863,Dos Equis Special Lager,3.08,12oz bottle stamped on neck is best by date of bbd feb 2024 clear pale gold colored body thin white head leaves some lacing webs behind aroma of caramel and corn malts a little bit of fruityfloral hops taste is more of the caramelcorn malts a little bit harsh but still has the style sweetness medium mouth feel more of a sweet corn finish excellent carbonation what stands out is the balance between the harsh bite and the malt sweetness
2864,Dos Equis Special Lager,2.58,my dad taught me to never drink beer from a green bottle with very few exceptions i believe he was absolutely right i wouldnt chase a taco with this swill
2865,Dos Equis Special Lager,4,a very sweet tasting and refreshing cerveza the cool bottle as well as the endorsement from the worlds most interesting man also doesnt hurt i just wish the alcvol was a bit higher and the cost a bit lower it is a beer meant to be enjoyed with some enchiladas or for an afternoon at the pool  style mexican lager  tapcanbottle bottle  abv 42  rating 4
2866,Dos Equis Special Lager,2.76,first off cap was extremely hard to get off without a bottle opener for no reason not totally disgusting feels a little watery recommend drinking cold overall decent wouldnt go out of my way to buy it again
2867,Dos Equis Special Lager,3.03,unremarkable tho ok its a slightly different light lager a bit of semisweetsemimalty taste  but lacking in carbonation and body
2868,Dos Equis Special Lager,4.65,large white head that dissipates slowly not much lacing the beer is a light golden color not yellow very clear active carbonation  pleasant aroma yeast and sweet malt smells like bread baking in the oven a little bit of hops  tastes light and refreshing not harsh at all very smooth light body but not too light or thin sweet tastes just like it smells smooth mild malts very slight toasted character to the malt no hop bitterness but a balanced slightly dry finish tastes good light but good dont taste much in the way of adjunct tastes like a light but decent quality lager reminiscent of session red lager but lighter little bit of dry corn taste to the finish overall taste is good much better than the vast majority of adjunct lagers  lots of carbonation but still soft and pleasant in the mouth very satisfying to drink this beer goes down smooth and easy  this is a premium adjunct lager similar to what pbr used to be back in the day i really enjoy drinking this beer just wish it was cheaper beer got so damn expensive its a damn shame but this is a nice old school lager beer good quality great drinkability hard not to like this its a really good beer
2869,Dos Equis Special Lager,2.25,pretty standard aal maybe even a bit thin for the style i wouldnt call it piss because it lacks even offensive qualities and im not hating on it these beers have their place and can be rightfully enjoyed as any other in terms of import lagers id take a modelo or corona over this
2870,Dos Equis Special Lager,3.18,drank from a 24oz can scent is funky with a little malt and sweaty socks taste is wet paper and malt with some skunk super easy to drink some lime really wakes this one up a decent beer to drink a couple of with some mexican food
2871,Berliner Apfel,4.73,a delightful light and crisp very effervescent beer in the glass lots of bubbles but with a neat head first sip is a delicious melange of green apple and pears nearly a cider in terms of flavor needless to say berliner apfel would pair well with many sandwiches or dinners but perhaps it is most well suited to pork the light clean taste would cut through and complement some of the fatty full flavor of pork ill tell you something else at 42 abv i think this would make a decent session beer its a clean enough taste that i can see have four or five of these without it becoming cloying its not overly sweet like some beers and ciders tailor made for bratwursts imho 
2872,Berliner Apfel,4.28,12oz bottle poured into a goblet a hazy pale orange one finger head s cerealgreen apple t almost ciderlike fresh tart  sweet green apple with wheat and pear in the background m light crispeffervescent slightly sweet  tart o crisp tasty and refreshing
2873,Berliner Apfel,4.42,poured from a 12oz bottle into my tall new glarus pilsner glass pours a slightly hazy yellowish gold with over three fingers of soapy white foam head sweet green apple and green apple candy on the nose lightly tart but juicy sweet green apples in the taste so light and refreshing mediumfull mouthfeel nicely carbonated  that is not too much here but enough perfect late summer beverage new glaruss fruit game is off the charts
2874,Berliner Apfel,4.52,12 oz bottle no datecode purchased single off shelf at their beer depot this week poured into a shaker pint  mildlycloudy yellow straw colored liquid ultratight cottony foam that builds high and lasts long on the nose apple cider mushed up fresh apple nothing suggesting great sweetness amazing expression palate amazing again this is decidedly appleforward no overt berliner weisse character even the maltwheat character is more full and sourdoughbready compared to a true berliner the aftertaste is apple fleshskin lemon juice boudin boule textures pillowy in body with a tart snap in the finish inflated flow lifting palate airy  having now had 5 different fruited beers from new glarus this week i cant help but to declare them possibly the best fruit beer brewery in the states i couldnt put this beer down moreish to a t no this isnt a true berliner weisse but this is utterly phenomenal work 2188
2875,Berliner Apfel,4.01,bringing cider over to the beer side of the drinking fence new glarus takes their premiere fruit series of beer to the tart side with the help of copious amounts of green apple and spontaneous fermentation  starting with a shallow golden straw color and basically clear berliner apfel starts with a foamy head that shows a zesty and sparkling pep that dissipates rather quickly as a sparkling cider appearances takes hold a sour alelike maltiness shows up first in aroma with a slow rise of sourdough taffy and yes apple flavors follow suit with a skim malt balance scant sweetness and dough  as the ale washes the middle palate its apple taste blends well with the suggestive juiciness of pear lemon lime gooseberry and passionfruit for a simple and less complicated taste the ale layers its flavors very well without ever loosing its tart balance winey spritzy and decidedly cidery this apple heavy beer takes on a acidic taste and texture but not without a persistent balance of sourdough even late in taste  crisp clean and simple in its flavor profile the uncomplicated session is an elevated cider with beery roots perfect for a refreshing session of apple fans with a brief echo of sourdough and lactic acid
2876,Berliner Apfel,3.92,murky yellow body finger of pearl white foam sparse sporadic lacing smells like apple cider meets gentle cereal and wheat not very sharp for style taste of apple cider gummy with gentle lemon forward berliner trappings backing easy drinking and tasty but depth is limited feel is very mildly tart more light beer body than a berliner fizzy even still i am enjoying my 4 pack on the porch this summer and early fall not every beer needs to be a deep and serious endeavor points for the flavors pulling through the whole glass nicely
2877,Berliner Apfel,3.63,it is a sparkling tart apple drink no funkiness from the spontaneous fermentation just tartness rather simple and one dimensional compared to the great berliners still enjoyable and quite easy to drink
2878,Berliner Apfel,4.24,12oz bottle etched at bottom of bottle is 023012002173b cloudy straw colored body one finger of white head quickly disappears to some islands and a ring leaves behind partial rings of lacing aroma of apple and pear with a lurking of bready malt taste is sweet with apple and pear minor tartness mostly sweet sweet apple in the aftertaste medium mouth feel with some stickiness which coats the mouth very minor tongue sting but indication of alcohol refreshingly sweet and very easy to drink
2879,Berliner Apfel,3.86,bottle at share courtesy of steve pale champagne colored body with a small frothy head tart apples in both the aroma and the taste seet prminent apple flavors tart
2880,Busch NA,2.83,12 oz can into a pint glass  appearance you know what this looks like it looks like cheap beer in every way that exists  aroma not that pleasant id be annoyed if it was though smells like canned corn somewhat to be very generous  taste rather inoffensive actually somewhat refreshing tastes very much like a us adjunct or light lager sort of reminds me of miller lite  mouthfeel watery chuggable if a person wants to chug nonalcoholic beer anyway  overall its not good but it gets the job done if you want to drink cheap beer and not feel it which you probably wouldnt with cheap alcoholic beer either unless you drank too much of it bud zero is an improvement on this model as far as noalcohol us lager goes however this is also 99 cents a can and bud zero is like 150 so maybe head for the mountains if youre looking to save some coinage
2881,Busch NA,2.5,nonalcoholic beer has been getting better as a beverage for when you need or want to limit alcohol intake but prefer the beer flavor over soda waters tea or any of those other beverages this one however still lags appearance nose palate are all underwhelming compared to others like athletic brewing
2882,Busch NA,1.5,i like it because it has virtually no taste or smell but helps me to replace good real local craft beer when the doctor says i need to give the liver a rest good for carrying the tart cherry concentrate to help with that too
2883,Busch NA,4.01,busch is a shitty beer ive stopped drinking exclusively nonalcoholic beers this is a great way to enjoy cheap beer with the guys in the garage when were working on cars without feeling left out sometimes a cheap beer is exactly what youre looking for
2884,Busch NA,2.46,not as bad as its more expensive unkle dad boi bud zero but still lacking in the feelz department its decently carbed but tastes like suckin on a thick can of pennies kinda how reg pbr does cheap tho
2885,Busch NA,1.39,purchased as a single can from the local drivethru for 99 poured into a nonic pint glass  l  pale straw with a quicktodisappear onefinger linen head s  corn wet hay slight grassiness t  corn flakes matzo bread underlying sweetness mild grass finish f  medium carbonation crisp and clean finish very light body o  a low alcohol content does not always a terrible beer make unfortunately this is a pretty bad brew i have yet to have a normal busch but the bar is set pretty low here reminds me of a miller lite will not purchase again and i highly recommend staying away from this one
2886,Busch NA,3,for what it is not that bad has nice carbonation malty taste nothing on bitterness but refreshing and zesty this is a great alternative when alcohol is not an option cheap too just like the real thing
2887,Busch NA,1.54,busch na is a very transparent very pale straw with a short lasting foamy head it smells of corn and something of crackers the taste is corny and the sweetness while not too strong is unbalanced the aftertaste is an unpleasant corn taste the feel is very watery with some bubbles overall it is busch without alcohol
2888,Busch NA,2.38,i have been drinking na beers for 2 months now due to reasons beyond my control this one is not great but unlike 75 of the ones i have tried so far is not offensive tastes like a watered down macro does not have the wort flavor or the off flavors of many other nas and the price is right lets face it no one drinks na beer because they prefer it to the real versions this one is not disgusting which puts it in the upper 25
2889,Busch NA,2.88,poured from a 12 oz can has a golden color with a 12 inch head smell is dominated by corn taste is also corn heavy some malts are present feels mediumlight bodied in the mouth and overall its not bad if you enjoy liquified corn but otherwise is a below average example of this style
2890,Busch NA,3.89,i can no longer find this product locally this na beer blew me away the first time i tried it the reason was it was the lowest price na beer on the shelf and the taste was very acceptable then i couldnt find it for a while and once it came back the taste was noticeably more watery do you think they could have changed the recipe  it was still ok but now it has disappeared again
2891,Busch NA,2.5,not actually all that bad actually a fair tasting beer i would not drink it on a consistent basis but i could see some times where high volume drinking is required this might warrant consideration
2892,Busch NA,3.35,im rating this compared to the arsenal of crappy mass produced american beer which i almost never drink but in the defense of bush na this tastes every bit like a miller light i really cant taste the difference if you are a miller light fan and want to not get drunk i think youd rate this beer a 5 seriously it tastes better than busch light  maybe there should be an na section on beer advocate where we rate nas next to their alcohol equivalent then this is hands down a 5  if you like mediocre imported beer then go for a heineken 00 i cant tell the difference between that and its alcohol counterpart thats also a 5 on the na scale
2893,Ayinger Maibock,3.56,330ml bottle into a pint glass appears to have been bottled 123 so 8 months old  hazy amber body small head shrinks to a broken ring specks of lacing aroma is a mixture of malt and apple taste is initially sweet then bitter then faintly sour quite warming in the throat disappointed in this one
2894,Ayinger Maibock,4,from the bottle it pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a nice small white head that eventually diminishes to a thin layer the nose gets a sweetish malt with some citrus the mouth follows with a lovely sweet malt flavor that demands repeating
2895,Ayinger Maibock,4.6,ive yet to meet a maibock i didnt like ayingers version however is exquisite chock full of semisweet bready malt goodness with slight touches of maybe apple or pear super balanced wildly quaffable another in the list of stylefaves from this brewery wow
2896,Ayinger Maibock,3.98,a sort of cloudy peach appearance body is about medium with just below average carbonation aroma is malt forward with some citrus fruit and peel coming in second theres a touch of roasted malt as well as some roasted chicory taste is sweetsomewhat syrupy with a mild bitter sourness in the background overall its very goodnot exactly what i expected and not sure i gave the most accurate description may not be the best but its also interesting flavorful and wont disappoint if you give it a try
2897,Ayinger Maibock,4.18,undated or at least i couldnt figure out the code poured aggressively from an 112oz bottle into a stein  appearance orangeyellow beer large fluffy white head that lingered a few minutes and left only a little lacing  nose mediumroasted malt a bit of light citrus  mouthfeel medium plenty of carbonation  attack rich and full toast  finish perfect hop balance to the attack  overall this is a winner absolutely the best maibock ive every tasted it deserves every bit of its 1 rating i cant imagine how good this would taste fresh on tap across the big pond at its home brewery
2898,Ayinger Maibock,4.01,very malty and bready definitely on the sweeter side for a maibock but perhaps unsurprising given the abv certainly drinks like a lowerabv offering medium to lightfull bodied but crisp and super smooth a bit of clove and banana from the yeast along with notes of honey white bread and cracker
2899,Ayinger Maibock,3.85,lclean clear light gold color  sgrainy maltnotes of honeytouch of breadiness  tgrainy malt profilegood but lacks the big bready notes i was expectinga touch of honey adds some sweatness to the grainy malt bill  fa bit thin in bodya bit sharp with the alcohol impression as well which may be from the thinner body per style  oi had a bottle of this a couple weeks ago and was a bit disappointed in what i was hoping for now reviewing it i guess my opinion has improved a bit but still would take hoffbrau maibock 100 times out of 100 to thisnot knocking this beer its decent enough but im a bit of an ayinger fanboy and was hoping for elite
2900,Ayinger Maibock,4.1,appearance pours a goldenhued color with a very slight haze to it healthylooking foamy white head  smell spiced honey with a rich pils maltiness and bready biscuity tones floral grassy herbaceousness hop accents  taste abundant bready pils malts with a sweet honey spread soundly spicy with a floral grassy vibe amidst a balanced mingling of bitterness and alcohol though still harboring a bit of malt richness theres a lightly drying quality to the finish  mouthfeel mediumbodied medium carbonation  overall a quite likable beer from a stalwart brewery
2901,Ayinger Maibock,4.79,enjoying a half liter in their biergarten in aying across from their hotel where im staying for the night so nice to just walk over after a couple beers finally got to try this legendary maibock and it lives up to the hype sweet slightly hoppy in the finish definitely strong like a bock should be smoother than it should be this packs a punch incredible beer  bought a mixed six pack at their hotel and this was included dated 300324 as good as i remember very subtle and quite boozy super smooth and perfectly sweet sneaks up on you bc its so drinkable
2902,Ayinger Maibock,4,i really liked it
2903,Ayinger Maibock,4.09,had this near pittsburgh pa from a 330ml bottled 20221117 date code l2321  a  clear gold with a 2finger white head and good lace  s  very bready noble spice floralhoneysuckle  clove light stone fruit  t  not quite as bready as expected from the aroma but still very present semiripe peach cumquat pepper coriander clove grassy mildmedium bitterness that lingers  m  medium body and carbonation soft and creamy at first then drier  o  this is very good i was a bit surprised by the amount of bitterness i enjoyed it and would have it again

2905,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,3.92,i tried maclays on the recommendation of dj cosmo from chez 1061 fm in ottawa i think that it tastes better than the big brands and it costs less too
2906,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,3.08,i bought a can at the beer store in ontario 473ml at 5 clear and good carbonation poured a 1finger head into glass that quickly disappeared but left a lace as you drink it taste is light malty apple with a mild bitterness and skunky hop flavor it feels like its watered down overall its light and easy to drink average  cheers
2907,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,2.53,light colour decent yet not lasting head overall its an ok beer considering the price point
2908,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,4.53,very good beer after a hot day in the garden excellent value
2909,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,2.41,poured from the 473ml can into a tall pilsener glass bubbly 1 inch head that diminished to a 14 but remained for longer than i expected medium carbonation and attractive lacing for a few minutes after the pour smell is faint and inoffensive  the usual hints of grain emphasis on the first word in pale ale very little hop flavour upfront although a bit of bitterness on the sides of the tongue and a mild hoppy bitter aftertaste at the back of the tongue tastes watered down generally as this is brewed by sleemans it carries the same profile  not too varied and drinkable im sure this isnt a faithful imitation of the original ale brewed in scotland which won awards at the turn of the 20th century but at 195 a can at the lcbo its certainly not without its merits
2910,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,1.51,what utter crap masquerading behind a label with traditional pale ale and the association with scotland i wont even waste my time going through the indices in describing this concoction cheap swill period even budweiser and tsing tao are a step above this shit
2911,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,2.48,wanted to do a formal review of this one so revisiting 473 ml can served cold into a pint glass purchased for 2 cdn  appearance  weak pale golden straw color decent finger of head was poured but doesnt last long some visible bubbles and the tiniest string of lacing left behind looks like a macro  smell some grainy notes and a bit of a cooked vegetable wrapped around metal vibe as well smells like a macro  taste  very bland i guess some coarse grainy flavor tastes like a macro although probably a bit better than some  mouthfeel  its wet and has a little less than average carbonation feels like a macro  overall  theres not too much good to say about this other than that it rates on par with macros and as far as english pale ales go its pretty bad i suppose theres a bit of bang for your buck here but in this area why not pay 10 cents more and get spaten for an incredibly more satisfying brew
2912,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.66,wow  absolutely one of the most insane heads ive seen on a really cold stout the head of three fingers just sat there bubbly beautiful light brown the beer a much darker brown but not too dark  not much on the nose  delicious smooth creamy a lot of good flavors nothing overpowering  great beer
2913,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.13,12 fl oz can served in a pokal glass  this beer pours black and is topped with a minimal tan head  i smell coffee anise chocolate and vanilla  the taste starts sweet with cocoa and vanilla i get some anise in the middle with black coffee it finishes sweet again with the initial flavors  full bodied with a smooth mouthfeel  solid beer i cant believe it took me so long to try it
2914,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.17,a very good ris poured from a 12oz can into a snifter this beer featured a dense brown color and a surprisingly big frothy light tancream color head head retention was excellent for this strong a beer minimal lacing on the glass aroma and taste feature a rich slightly sweet maltiness with lots of coffee and some chocolate in the flavor mouthfeel was rich and smooth with a little alcohol warming but no harshnessthis is one of the better ris style beers i have had

2917,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.01,12oz can from tavour near black pour barely there beige head subtle aroma roast malts light chocolate taste brings subtle sweetness dark chocolate cocoa creamy feel smooth not a lot of the abv is apparent basic impy stout executed perfectly
2918,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.21,12 ounce can dating is smudged so i cant tell when this was canned served in a snifter the beer pours dark brownblack with about an inch or so tan head that stayed around a while theres also a lot of lacing aroma is nice the brew smells like dark chocolate roasted malt coffee and molasses taste is pretty much just like the aroma but theres also some dark fruit licorice and burntcharred malt flavors noticeable too mouthfeelbody is mediumfull its coating and has a moderate amount of carbonation i thought this was an enjoyable enough imperial stout i liked it
2919,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.81,4 pack purchased from wegmans on 91222 poured from a 12 oz can into a stemless goblet  l pitch black  s deep roasted aroma molasses  t smooth rich almost coffee like flavor  f silky smooth rich almost toffee like flavor  o a fantastic and approachable russian imperial stout
2920,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.17,pours a glossy black with ample mocha foam that leaves lacing on the glass the taste is heavy on the malts with a sweet molasses taste and an undertone of coffee and light bourbon barrel oak it is less heavy on char and more heavy on cola sweetness and that kind of chocolate flavor that the malt imparts however some roasted malts poke through on the aftertaste and strangely makes my throat tingle the feel is medium and carbonation is fine
2921,Reality Czeck,4.59,from city brew tours canned may 23rd  it pours a pale gold with a couple of fingers of foam lacing is very good  the smell is noble hops bread grassy lovely overall aromas  the taste is nice grassy noble hops some bread a bit spicythis is what i imagine that a bohemian pilsner should smell and taste like  medium bodied lively carbonation  superb

2923,Reality Czeck,3.79,clear golden pour with a 3 finger white head the head retention is quite good and it took a long time to pour the beer into the glass slight maltgrain nose a bit of bread biscuit here the flavor is malty as expected the flavor has a lot of grain in it bread and biscuit slight earthy flavor theres a slight bit of bitterness on the back from the hops light crisp clean body easy drinking and delicious
2924,Reality Czeck,4.35,poured at fridge temp from a can pours a wonderful transparent yellow with a good amount of white head solid lacing bubbles rising at a moderate speed throughout the nose is great wheat banana apples slight citrus a floral note and grass  the taste is fantastic a nice fruity sweetness hits first with a transition to a hoppy note on the back end grainy dry prickly banana apricot grassy earthy and a slight peppery spice super flavorful  mouthfeel is really crisp and refreshing dry
2925,Reality Czeck,4.27,new brewery for me courtesy of beersnake1  brewers notes a delicate soft lager authentic to the west coast of the czech republic  huh a coast is a land mass adjacent to a body of water  i guess germany and france have been moved into the atlantic ocean  canned 1010 opened 1122 poured into a spiegelau ipa glass clear golden liquid active carbonation streams  fluffy two finger white foam cap  good retention  settles yo a mounded island  spotty lacings  aroma is clean grassy  taste is grassy   mouthfeel is low sudsing sweet  clean crisp   good beer
2926,Reality Czeck,5,the best czech style pilsner i have had not surprised to see it ranked number one here incredibly crisp with clean malt that lingers throughout the palette the lacing is also just a joy to watch incredible
2927,Reality Czeck,4.04,16oz can served in a willibecker canned on 04252022 pours a lovely golden yellow with a tight creamy 15 inch bright white head that slowly collapses in on itself lovely nose  clean and grassy with a big hit of noble hops taste consistent with nose with the addition of a light lemony character finish is slightly medicinal and bitter mouthfeel is light in body with an assertive carbonation that finishes semidry overall quite lovely but not as delicate as i would have liked to have seen
2928,Reality Czeck,4.4,look nice clear amber with a thick white head lots of carbonation  smell nice clean malt and hop notes  taste very crisp relatively hoppy with just a hint of malt  feel very bubbly
2929,Reality Czeck,4.4,ive always been a german pilsner guy but this one converted me wow easily the best czech pils ive ever had
2930,Reality Czeck,4.8,the best representation of anything youll find in the czech republic amazingly thirst quenching and genre defining my all time fav moonlight beer never stop making this
2931,Reality Czeck,4.33,a little bitter on the finish
2932,Duvel,4.03,ive been drinking duvel for years and its an awesome beer i do have a few observations that id like to share first it has always had a bit of an astringent acidic bitterness on the finish that i dont love compared to other belgian strong ales ive noticed that acidity tends to calm down a bit if you drink it a bit warmer at cellar temp this makes a big difference to me still a world class beer without question and one of the best beer glasses in the industry imho
2933,Duvel,4.25,it certainly does kick up a generous white head of foam over a clear golden ale nose is good first sip is tart a little bitter but holds your interest overall taste is on the lighter side and more refreshing than i thought it would be would definitely try again
2934,Duvel,4.1,pours a straw yellow lots of foam and that high carbonation carries into the bubbly mouthfeel its a light belgian the herbs are light but interesting grapefruit rind and lightly bitter great for summer
2935,Duvel,3.51,re reviewing after more beer drinking experience all duvel creations will always get a 5 for appearance  aroma is a little musky and fizzy malt almost some banana like a wheat beer not my favourite aroma i prefer more hops  taste is much much better than the aroma so much yeastiness and different flavours and aromas this is unpasteurized for sure pasteurization destroys every beer bitterness dominates followed by a foamy hit that explodes on the tongue and wriggles down the throat into the stomach you can feel it as it continues its journey  the taste relies primarily on malt without that much noticeble hops it has a slight hint of being overtly fermented a feeling that you will have a really bad headache the next day other beers dont give me this feeling i would not want to drink this every day where as a west coast ipa i would be happy to drink 10 a day if i could find 10 a day  i much prefer the equinox but its still good but its not as good as many west coast ipas or even a chouffe ipa this doesnt come close its one of the best commercial beers in the world for sure but it needs more hops  
2936,Duvel,4.19,classic for a reason consistently good double blonde fragrant and fresh aromatic ale classic
2937,Duvel,5,unlike the flowery full of platitudes self aggrandizing pandering and slightly too elegant if you know what i mean puffy reviews i will sum up this beer as the bomb mint fing great
2938,Michelob Golden Draft,3.49,from a can this is one of those beers where the light version tastes better than the heavy pours a beautiful colour but thats where things end taste is too meh not great but could be worse i suppose
2939,Michelob Golden Draft,3.57,drank from a 12 ounce can scores are based on the style  look  would much prefer if the can was full blue or full silver the gradient isnt doing it for me that said the circular seal is nice and the emphasis on golden draws in the eyes the minnesota shaped barcode is a neat touch too  smell  i cant quite describe the experience of this beer hitting my nose the smell gets you from a good distance away but its the smell of nearly nothing its like a diamond plate floor covered in sticky beer residue very metallic and mildly sweet  taste  thankfully the taste is much more interesting than the smell its a comforting flavor too even though ive never had this beer before it tastes like tailgating like being in a trailer at the racetrack like going to a concert at the county fair this tastes like public gatherings or more realistically its a fine balance of malty and earthy not too sweet not too bitter an exemplary aal  feel  this beer feels perfectly matched to its taste mediumthin body with just enough backoftongue sparkle to it  overall  i definitely prefer this to the light version but the light version is probably objectively better for a full day of parking lot drinking however at home im much more comfortable with the full weight its tasty its easy its relaxing and i can confidently say that i like it
2940,Michelob Golden Draft,3.8,why is this beer so hard to find
2941,Michelob Golden Draft,3.21,it is what it is
2942,Michelob Golden Draft,3.04,i cant find this one around central wi golden light is everywhere i pick ups 12pk every time i visit family in mn it is a nice change in my regular adjunct lager rotation nothing special just a good beer
2943,Michelob Golden Draft,3.05,got to try this when working in minnesota in 2002not a bad beerand the locals consumed it like waterseems ab would sell this outside the midwestas not available in the southwestoverallfairly decent offering
2944,Michelob Golden Draft,5,i believe this is the smoothest tasting brew so far out of all michelob products it leaves no bitter after taste very smooth body and flavor good job
2945,Michelob Golden Draft,4.15,i was pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed several cans of michelob golden draft at a recent trivia night fundraiser for my kids school it was much better than the other beers offered including pbr and budweiser i just wish i could find it in stores as all i can seem to find is golden light
2946,Michelob Golden Draft,3.81,by some insane indiana state law it was is illegal to buy alcohol except in bars and restaurants on sunday i remember that this one came out the first sunday that i was in grad school at purdue since i couldnt take a sixpack back to the dorm with me i sat in the local bar not too far off campus drank a few pitchers of this then went to the free showing of alladin on campus taking many pee breaks oh those youthful magic moments
2947,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.12,pours amber with a 2 finger foamy white head the aroma is spicy with a touch of fruit the taste is peppery  herbal with notes of citrus fruits and a touch of hoppy bitterness nice balance to the flavour profile and there is a good level of carbonation too nice little beer
2948,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.19,classic belgian yeast caramel taffy banana coriander nutmeg earthy spices nice and surprisingly easy drinking leaves pretty lacing
2949,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.05,aroma gives off bubblegum and bananas the body is an immediate wave of refreshing cool carbonation and the flavor is just like the aroma delectable sumptuous sweet banana bubblegum and some of that coriander spice too this is a great blonde
2950,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.52,from a bottle head to head with duvel pours browner than duvel and tastes darker too like brown honey nice herbal flavor and light bitterness i need to figure out what coriander tastes like because everyone says that its here
2951,La Chouffe (Blonde),3.15,rereviewing as the last review i wrote was after at about 5 bottles of various triples and quadruples and i was pretty much only seeing pink elephants and elfs and devils and satans and lucifers is the devil and satan the same and also lucifer no lucifer is different from the devil  bought from my casino supermarket in paris  there is an elf thing on the bottle maybe chouffe is an elf not sure  nice look  in glass loving it deep red amber colour nice level of head  aroma has elements of duvel though much more carbon dioxidy and less apricot fruitness it seems very heavy without enough hops to balance the heavyness  taste certainly draws some parallels with duvel and delirium tremens for me this is nowhere near as well mastered to the same level flavours are less intense and there is a distinct carbon dioxidefizzy water flavour citrus is quite prominent mainly lemon peel and tangerine  coriander is listed in the ingredients i also faintly taste peach though overall its balance of flavours is not up there with the best belgian triples as the carbon dioxide bubbles disappear the taste improves  i have to disagree with the bros giving it 99 going to have a duvel now to compare yes duvel is far superior  try them together there is much difference  probably the most overrated beer on this site in my opinion please try the chouffe ipa that is so much better and one of my favourite commercially available beers ever this has too much maltinessit really needs the extra hops duvel and delirium tremens are naturally better balanced without the coriander this would not taste of much at all and adding coriander is cheating in my opinion only hops and cannabis should be allowed in addition to malt and sugar and water obviously
2952,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.38,slightly hoppy hints of pepper and coriander a clean taste without any alcohol bite despite being 8 abv it is one of my top three favorite beers it is always priced better than my other favorites  delirium tremens and chimay white
2953,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.5,beautiful blonde ale spicy and inviting aroma tastes a little like it pours golden honey sweetness with notes of pepper and coriander imho one of the best around great brewery in general
2954,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.33,pours almost clear honey gold with a pillowy white head that lasts clings and forms kind of a whipped cream dollop in the middle of the glass  smells pretty belgian to me fruity apple pear maybe a bit of melon very estery sweet malt peppery coriander phenolic close the show  the taste is bright but definitely sweet its quite sweet kind of honey sweet the fruity melange is very flavorful midtaste lots of green apple a banana i missed in the nose melon pear grassy herbaceous hops but not too much the aftertaste is a big hit with me  quite peppery a kiss of coriander pleasant phenolic belgian yeast goodness with a deft overlay of hoppiness  its very dry fairly lively carbonation aftertaste sneaks up then theres a wallop of peppery spice some coriander and fruity bubblegum aromatics without the nonsense that comes with bubblegum  maybe more like juicy fruit apple revisits in the aftertaste as well  this is some good stuff right here glad i grabbed the single which are pretty scarce given the wraparound cardboard four packs
2955,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.46,excellent beer what stands out to me is the incredibly velvety feel it has would happily drink this anytime
2956,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.39,poured from a 330ml bottles  pours a slightly hazy amber with a two finger head that stays for an age  the smell is yeasty orange and coriander tustle with each other whilst the barest hint of alcohol lingers in the background the taste follows the smell  coriander to the fore over citrus and a mild bitterness rounding it out the mouthfeel is full and creamy  overall satisfying and tasty  a good beer for an occasion or an occasional beer  very rich and too much so for regular drinking  for me at least but still a very good beer
2957,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.53,500ml bottle in vientiane laos pours a beautiful cloudy orangey gold colour with a nice retentive head strong aroma of oranges herb cereal coriander comes through in the taste really interesting and enjoyable
2958,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4,81623 pour is a murky browndeep ruby half finger of lightly khaki foam dissipates quickly to ring around the glass nose is caramel toffee bourbon taste is bourbon citrus orange vanilla oak toffee caramel solid bitterness definitely not overly sweet will likely benefit from some extended aging good beer
2959,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.18,4pk
2960,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.36,at least 25 years old great barleywine overall but the barrel is muted not getting much more than the standard here
2961,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.31,received in a trade with dim 3823 consumed for review 3923 2023 edition  beer poured dark brown with a very nice offwhite head  nose is very nice as the bourbon barrel forward extended aging is lending notes of vanilla along with citrus  taste follows the nose as the malt base emits notes of figs and plums the barrel lends a touch of vanilla and the generous hopping lends some orange overtones finishes nicely balanced between the bourbon and the citrus hops with some residual heat from the barrel  mouthfeel is medium to large bodied very smooth and chewy  overall a very nice beer that i am thankful for the opportunity to try i am not a huge believer in aging beers given my mature palate but i suspect if this rested a year or so the flavors would integrate nicely
2962,Barrel Aged Behemoth,3.56,another big ups to nick for breaking this out in the backyard may 2022  pours dark brown 14 beige head at its peak lower carbonation possibly the aroma was decent but revealed more of the clash to come bittering hops bourbon oak vanilla maris its all there and its not totally disjointed but doesnt really hit that beatles like note of come together  taste yeah see this just kind of tastes like an imperial of their barleywine rather than the smoothness of a bourbon barrel you get amplified heat and bitterness the 100ibu level of the base is just ramped up here like i like american barleywines its my biggest complaint about bil and their english barleywine kink but this beer is evidence for their claims not mine i guess i just think one version is better barreled versus not barreled the vanilla didnt pan out here weird i preferred their adjunct barleywine to this cant win em all id still buy a 4 pack because i think these would be pretty good a decade from now just not now as much
2963,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.34,single bottle from jungle jims
2964,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.7,pours out dark brown with hardly a head on top has a strong licorice raisin smell the barrel comes after it warms tastes the same as it smells and gets stronger as it sits
2965,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.08,meh
2966,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.19,2023 vintage into a small snifter  a murky dark brown with surprisingly lasting rim of head with a few blotches of lacing  s vanilla chocolate coconut rum raisin and dark and burnt caramel  malt and barrel aroma blasts left and right  t flavor heavy malty with raisin coconut dark caramel vanilla milk and dark chocolate and soft coffee in the finish it is firmly bitter with a bit of spicy hop flavor in the aftertaste alcohol character is obvious but not overbearing  m feel is very drinkable with medium body and a little of hefty syrup in the finish but high carbonation for the style which works  o very enjoyable fresh ba barleywine from 3f  big upgrade from the base level trim
2967,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.03,this is quite good actually not my absolute favorite of the style because in typical 3 floyds fashion this is more hoppy than other barleywines so it has some bitterness to it as opposed to full on whiskey raisins still pretty good
2968,Ruination IPA,4.39,bottle to pint glass done with fruity little hazies ready to get back to what made you dig ipas in the first place heres your golden ticket back to hop city dank and stanky and crisp and lively drink this
2969,Ruination IPA,4.46,a little light on the look and feel but overall a very solid west coast double ipa on the side of bitter and bright not buttery whatsoever not floral not caramel not citrus just straight up west coast imperial ipa crisp and dry dank
2970,Ruination IPA,4.38,l  bright golden with great clarity and a white head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind a thin cap and some lacing s  bright floral hops faint bubblegum citrus smells somewhat faint t  bright resinous piney hops up front and throughout intermixed well with floral notes citrus some biscuit and hints of bubblegum f  medium bodied with moderate carbonation crisp and refreshing o  beautifully simple the og west coast dipa
2971,Ruination IPA,5,the classic recipe delivers the double ipa that solidified my love of the double ipa overall a perfect representation of the style everything you want for the style including a rich amber color hop forward flavor perfect malt backbone and a bitter finish to deliver an amazing beer stone got it right with this recipe and i am glad they brought it back to celebrate
2972,Ruination IPA,4.47,one of my old favorites in early 2010s  a pours a golden copper color leans on the transparent side but this allows the incredible bubbles rising to be seen clearer thick fluffy head that sticks around gorgeous  s bitter oily pine floral undertones  t lots and lots of pine honey delightfully bitter resin some grassy character in the finish  mfull bodied with a bitter aftertaste  o a phenomenal old school ipa that spits in the face of current trends love it
2973,Ruination IPA,4.5,look  aggressive pour with nice foamy white head color is clear and copper good lacing throughout smell  grapefruit floral taste  sweet malt caramel citrus pith tangerine spice dank hops resin big medium body with bitter carbonation that simmers to a soft dry finish on the top of the tongue overall very enjoyable a few 4 packs upon release but im more a fresh jai alai or tropicalia kinda guy
2974,Ruination IPA,4.32,from a 12oz can dated packaged 122722 best by 42623 into a pint glass  pours a translucent golden orange with about one finger of white head excellent retention and lacing  smells pretty much exclusively of pine some light notes of dirt and grass  taste follows pine pine pine bitter pine  sticky mouthfeel with a strong long lasting bitter aftertaste medium carbonation  this beer is as advertised and its wonderful never had the og so the wonderfulness of this beer is asis no comparisons necessary
2975,Midnight Still,4.53,2020 version poured from a bottle into a snifter this is nicely thick with a strong fudge flavor
2976,Hazy IPA,2.94,not my favorite bit of a pungentsulfur note
2977,Hazy IPA,3.74,not bad but not great looks like a golden ipa of the hazy variety in the glass with nice white lacing smell is a bit too grassy for me as is the aftertaste mouthfeel is light i would prefer a bit more mouthfeel with a fruitier flavor but it is what it is and its not bad worth trying
2978,Hazy IPA,3.52,its a pale yellow hazy with a white head theres a little bit of citrus note in the aroma but not a lot the flavor starts off with a mild citrus and sweetness combo thats unassuming before a small hop bite shows up its not bad and worthy of another glass but its not among the top
2979,Hazy IPA,3.53,from a 12oz can  appearance hazy yellow good head  smell mild citrus  taste a little hoppy bite at first but then settles into the typical soft mildly sweet citrus taste of most hazies maybe a touch more bitterness of citrus rind in the finish  overall last beer from the stone mix pack hazies used to be kind of fun but ive had too many that give the same experience this one from stone blends in with the pack the beer is fine but nothing too exciting
2980,Hazy IPA,2.75,stone one of those og brewers with the crazy devil logo man that takes me back a couple decades or more youre not worthy  regrettably in as lazy a segue as youre likely to see today this bland brew is also not worthy i mostly get watery bitterness like a mermaid in unrequited love nelson dying in the depths of victory unable to savor the triumph at trafalgar a diver missing a podium finish for improper speedos  love ya guys and gals but this stuff doesnt deserve to share a zip code with the likes of ruination
2981,Hazy IPA,3.43,picked up a 6 of this the other day from the weird store in fernley so much out of date beer but this was a new beer so it couldnt be that old  pours a hazy yellow color 14 white head nothing out of the ordinary going on here appearance wise the aroma was kind of lacking sabro can pop it didnt here el dorado and azacca are noticeable but giving vague not sharp nor specific hop tones if anything comes off like generic citra giving some citrus of a sweeter variety but also with some sawdust  the taste is equally ho hum there is a light tropical juiciness coming through but there is also a bitterness that doesnt jive well with the hazy ipa substyle its a definite walk back from the early days of stones hoppy goodness doesnt seem like it has a wheatoat flaked base in addition to barley doesnt hit that smooth note it was affordable but far from inspiring kind of like a recreation use only person in middle age on a dating app yowza
2982,Hazy IPA,3.26,pours a predictably hazy yellow color with a foamy white head smells of tropical fruits tastes a lot like the aroma sweet fruity flavors medium body its ok for the style
2983,Hazy IPA,3.5,a solidbutnotforme juicy ipa with orange and tropical fruit flavor and nose smells more fruity than ipa unusually easydrinking for an ipa which means that for an ipa lover the aftertaste might be too bland and malty there is some bitterness but nothing highlighting any of the piney aspects of hops this is the ipa for someone who likes blue moon okay maybe thats a bit harsh its nowhere near as good as their other beers but better for someone who finds stones style too aggressive disappointing for me but id still drink this any day over most beer
2984,Hazy IPA,4.14,part of a stone ipa assortment pack poured from 12 oz can a hazy light honey tone decent foamy head that did not persist plenty of tropical fruit in the aroma    mango and guava pretty juicy in the mouth taste seems a little weaker than that up front aroma a little light on the tongue crisp finish still thinking it all over    pretty mellow
2985,Hazy IPA,3.78,its not nearly as good as sierra nevadas hazy but its not bad
2986,Hazy IPA,3.82,beer pours a hazy honey color with a foamy soapy 4 fingers of white head the haze is a bit light but definitely there heavy sticky lacing on the glass  lots of tropical fruits on the nose mango pineapple and guava like scents some pithy citrus as well faint hint of pine far in the background  very juicy on the taste definitely getting the mango and guava type of fruits on the taste a light hint of the citrus pith giving it the smallest amount of bitterness on the finish  mouth feel is a bit on the upward end of light not quite into the medium very light on the bitterness  overall this is a quality ipa with light bitterness lots of juice notes not like a sugary juice more like a natural fruit juice i understand companies move on but i still miss the scorpion bowl ipa it was a nice juicy one like this with a bit more bitterness for a little bite this is really a good ipa for those scared that the beer is going to be overly bitter because it is an ipa another job well done to stone brewing
2987,Stroh's Light,4.04,for a light beer it has body and a good taste and smell the flavor last unlike most light beers  its a damn good light beer
2988,Stroh's Light,2.25,strohs light light lager 382  clear pale yellow gold color with a frothy white cap of foam thin light lager aroma and taste with mild corn and grains cheers
2989,Stroh's Light,2,apours a golden color with a slight head and lacing aaroma has lemongrass hints tthe taste follows the nose with a lemongrass flavor ma medium bodied decently carbonated beer oa decent beer
2990,Stroh's Light,1.5,strohs light  if i remember correctly the original strohs was one of the blandest beers to have ever crossed my lips long ago when i was still in college and actually had friends who were off getting engaged and crawling up their fiances ass to die until the inevitable divorce anyway this joins the story as the last beer not sure its even brewed anymore but its here and in front of me right now so it shall get a drinkin  look  crystal clear yellow with a big ass heavily frothy white head that splits like a wanna be gangsta dad finding out his one night stand is knocked up carbonation looks cripplingly high and painful no lacing as the head didnt retain for long enough 15  smell  rice like adjuncts all over the place with a dosage of seltzer and mineral water 15  taste  prettttyyyy much the same rice adjuncts and seltzer water 15  feel  heavily carbonated with a very watery nearly unbearable body 15  overall  how can you take something like strohs and make it even lighteri really didnt see a difference between this and the original both painfully bland and not worth the cool labels on the can 15
2991,Roggenbier,3.02,had an interesting look but positive end there had to try this style but definitely not in my palate would guess thus is an avg or avg offer for this style
2992,Roggenbier,4.28,iron hill media  a murky orange with nice bubbles thin white head with little lacing  s bready and malty with definite banana  t moderate sweetness and light hop bitterness banana is the most prominent notes of chocolate and caramel very nice finish  m medium to full body that was thick and chewy the carbonation was lively very nice  o this is one of my favorites from iron hill very drinkable
2993,Roggenbier,4.3,served on cask during the recent iron hill  lancaster xmas in july event this version has been aged on caraway seeds  a  pours murky orange with a small one finger tall white head leaving little to no lacing down the glass  s  smells of bready rye spice clove sweet caramel malt banana light earthy hops and the spicysweet caraway this has a ton going on yet it remains true to style  t  starts off with a nice mix of spicy rye and chewy caraway slowly giving way to a mix of wheat banana clove light hop bitterness and some sweet caramel malt this one has a lot going for it yet it remains very drinkable the finish is a mix of chewiness and spice lingering for a short period of time  m  medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation spicy chewy feel with plenty of it lingering through the finish  o  very nice i am glad i started with this one i typically dont enjoy too many chewy beers but this one was a revelation i really liked the flavors and it never got to the point of being overpowering great stuff
2994,Roggenbier,4.42,on handpump at iron hill lancaster aged with caraway seeds  similar but distinct from the draft version the softer carbonation and lack of c02 brings out the rye spiciness much stronger than the draft pour is similar to draft opaque and murky copper brown with a bubbly fleeting clear head initially has traditional dunkelweiss flavors clove fruit banana and yeast the rye spice and breadiness of the caraway i liked the base and i like this treatment even more ive only previously had troegs scratch roggen but im very impressed by both versions of iron hills
2995,Roggenbier,4.08,christmas in july indeed before santa arrives i have time to sip through this roggenbier served from a handpump oh yeah and the ale has been aged on caraway seeds  a from a cask the roggenbier is hazy and clouded to the point of opacity the result is a dunkellike ale dark but not deeply brown the cask renders a thin head bubbly and thin  s the nose is very weizenlike plenty of sweet clove and phenols rye is slow to emerge spicy and bready when it finally gets primed up the caraway and rye are sweet and anisey a complement to the weizens softness  t oh mythe caraway aging was a brilliant idea augmenting the spicy rye presence with chewy goodness first things first though the wheat beer starts off with clove and banana sweet reminders of the potency of the german yeast as the initial weizen aspects pass the rye and caraway become all the more apparent the darker caraway adds depth and breadiness spices particularly anise as well the cask serving temperature prolongs the breadiness the base roggenbier is good but this the caraway pushes it to the next level get it while its still on  m a sweet mouthfeel that yoyos between weizen and rye super added awesomeness points for the caraway
2996,Roggenbier,4.5,64 abv  a this was a murky cloudy dark golden brown it poured with a thick creamy head  s big bruised bananas with hints of chocolate toffee and spicy rye  t more cocoa here than the smell suggested but the banana still dominates rye spiciness and hints of clove at the finish  m very thick and chewy overall  o this is becoming a favorite style of mine one i rarely get to try unfortunately this was well worth ending my long standing boycott of iron hill growlers for in fact ill probably go back for another fill of my new ih screw top
2997,Roggenbier,4.05,first had on tap at iron hill media pa  a very tasty rye beer poured a cloudy burnt sienna with a healthy white head that retained well light spices and banana aroma toasted malts up front on the taste very organic and earthy with a thick banana taste coming through and rye sourness in the finish with a hint of spice smooth medium body and very drinkable
2998,Roggenbier,3.89,had on tap at phoenixville  appearance redbrown in color 12 inch head cloudy high carbonation  smell bananas and light rye  taste toasted malt start with an earthy middle with the banana and rye creeping in and the rye lingering around for the aftertaste  mouthfeel medium carbonation semisweet with a spicy rye finish mediumheavy bodied  drinkability a nice alternative to a hefe i like how the rye is there but not too overpowering a sipper due to its heaviness but a beer i would like to have again
2999,Roggenbier,4,a hazy dark orange with minimal head that disappears quickly and some lace  s clove and a bit of sourness and a slight banana finish  t sour rye flavor with clove and banana bread notes  m petulant bubbles with a clean yet sour finish  d easy drinker for the change of winter to spring sourness is balanced and does not build
3000,Roggenbier,4,very hazy caramel colour topped by a short cap of offwhite foam good head retention the aroma was mostly bread crust with some spicy rye and mild banana character mild bitterness with sweet caramel rye and mild banana notes throughout bread crust appeared at the end and it finished quickly with a burst of spicy rye slick oily texture with moderate carbonation and medium body a little creamy quite an enjoyable pint lots of interesting flavours are present but they dont tire the palate if this shows up again definitely try it
3001,Busch Beer,3.54,so im doing some twerking outside the window of a dennys when im violently tackledits the policeface first into an unopened can of busch i slide it into one of the spacious pockets of my jncos 50 pipes just before im hoisted upright just when things are looking grim my best mate gordon blevins slithers out of the pawn shop next door with a fist full of bills and the unmistakable swagger of a man who can now afford cinnabon for dinner  gordon is brilliant he convinces the officers that i am just that overthemoon for a moons over my hammy which is true he also informs them that i havent been quite right since i found out my stepcousin cynfia is having triplets and i might not not be the dad once im out of the cuffs and comfortably seated with my hammy i remember the busch swimming somewhere in the sea of denim below a little spelunking does the trick and im bs deep in busch  looks yeah it got em have you seen this design its a focking snowcapped mountain range clamp a clothespin around your nostrils because what it boasts in taste it lacks in scent like it smells of aunt deberlys fullcoverage underwear i dug out from twixt the futon cushions with my teeth feels like wet beer overall i chose a number from the dropdown menu not even remotely commensurate with this beers quality
3002,Busch Beer,2.72,from a can i hoped this would have been better than busch light but it really wasnt i found it to have more flavour but not in a good way half the case ended up being a drain pour
3003,Busch Beer,1,disgusting got a good deal on a 12 pack and could only force myself to drink 6 i have low standards for beer and this was disturbingly bad kind of reminded me of the way raw chicken smells
3004,Busch Beer,3.06,i expected to hate this late night beer run in the county and the local corner store had this bud light never and keystone among some crappy malt beverages like steel reserve so i grabbed a quick case of busch made sure it was nice and cold and cracked one open expecting a funky flat corn water but instead i was surprised to find and decent cheap adjunct that had nothing negative going on honestly on a hot day on the farm this seems like it would hit the spot its a pleasant surprise
3005,Busch Beer,4.74,this isnt some awesome craft beer but damn is this shit good easy drinking no after taste maybe a bit to light for the price the tastethis shit is great this should be abs premium beer not bud or bud light i dont have the money to spend on craft beers every day so this is one of my go to beers
3006,Busch Beer,3.97,this beer is best in a bottle only places i have seen it sold in bottles is in st louis since i grew up in st louis busch beer in bottles brings back memories of summer bbqs of grilled pork steaks its light and is refreshing on hot sticky midwest summer days
3007,Busch Beer,4.79,pretty much all i drink cheap and easy going down like my ex
3008,Busch Beer,2,had that one time at a party back in the day i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included
3009,Busch Beer,4.36,beer snobs stay away i was once a beer snob and while i still enjoy craft beer the hot virginia sun and a 7 abv 90 ibu ipa dont agree with me or each other enter busch its slightly sweet never skunky completely inoffensive and easy to drink as far as adjunct lagers go this one doesnt seem to have any flaws it is exactly what it is golden bubbly crisp a little corny and hydrating this may hurt some feelings but it tastes similar to hamms or pbr but less than them in some weird way who cares about doing a legit beer review with taste mouthfeel etc its an adjunct lager and a tasty crushable one at that open up the beer fridge at my house and there is a chance youll see something from a local craft brewery or trader joes maybe some yuengling budweiser or modelo but there will always be busch in there its just that good
3010,Busch Beer,3,havent had an ice cold busch since 1986 and did not expect much so it wasnt as bad as i thought it might be very light for cheap adjunct lager and not too corny tasting either so thats a plus fizzy white head is gone in a flash slightly better than bud maybe but not awful for this type of cheap junk beer it could be another 35 years before i buy this again has even less beer flavor than their na version super crusher and no sticky gack stuck in my craw like hamms hot day slummin pick from the catamount cold cave
3011,Busch Beer,2.5,pours decent  rapidly fading head i know its not really mistaken for coors products but looking at this can and website this brand really likes to use their mountain backdrop and the natural light was created to compete with miller lite the retro logo even modeled after it not surprising though given the og budweiser brand is a parody of the og beer of kings nontheless this beer is about as average as average gets id post something about the flavor but its what i would imagine one would experience if they had that covid 19 thing that destroyed so many small businesses and families apparently it took your smell away anyway 43 abv busch i think the busch light is 41 abv just funny to note
3012,Smoked Porter,3.99,pours a dark brown with some red highlights a thin tan head and no lacing smells of roasted malts chocolate caramel a bit of smoke and some nuttiness taste follows the nose with additional notes of dark fruits and a nice hop presence expected far more smokiness seems more like a porter medium bodied light side of medium carbonation smooth mouth feel
3013,Smoked Porter,4.13,from a bottle brewed 122715 dark brown color with a thin layer of brown head roasted malt and vanilla smell feels a little thin roasted malt and smoke with some hop bitterness on the finish great flavor wish the feel was a little bit heavier
3014,Smoked Porter,3.92,from notes 4212 pours dark brown with a ruby highlight when held to the light the pour produces a frothy tan shortlived head that receded to nothing and left no lacing aroma is dark roast dark fruit chocolate a little cherry and smoke taste is the same with heavier dark malt notes and a nice nuttiness with minor hop hints in the finish and a lingering bitter aftertaste the level of smoke is a little disappointing the taste is well balanced mouthfeel is mediumheavy bodied with nice carbonation smooth and very drinkable
3015,Smoked Porter,4,not as smoke forward as i like but still an undeniably good beer its a bit more on the traditional porter side with a nice hop bite caramel sweetness and deep roasted nut aroma theres a light kiss of smoke but it makes you work for it unfortunately although a good beer when reaching for a smoky fix i go for ofallons smoked porter yazoo sue or aecht schlenkerla rauchbier urbock
3016,Mickey's,2.6,l gold body with a white fizzy top that disappeared rather quickly s not much at all on the nose maybe some corn very faint t drier than all other malt liquors that i have tasted goes down easily f full bodied beer enjoyable mouth feel o i picked this up for a dollar a bottle what could go wrong
3017,Mickey's,3.77,just a good old cheap americanbeer delicious when served super cold great summer brew not a pretentious light beer
3018,Mickey's,3.16,had mickeys fine malt liquor at the thunderbird inn savannah poured from 24oz can bottom stamped apparently best by jun0523 into hotel water glass  pours light yellow with clarity and 1 to 2finger foamy nearwhite head with good retention leaving sticky lace down the glass hugely sweet malt aroma off pour becoming a little more cornlike with some vague fruitiness and finally a little herbal quality begins only moderately sweet and surprisingly mouthfilling then its all creamy malt both barley and corn until a little unidentifiable fruity wang appears as warms before a drying slightlybitter herbal finish  a beautiful pilsnerlike appearance delivers    not much but a creamy body but not much unpleasant either unless you let it warm up but thats not the proper protocol for malt liquor better than anticipated might drink again
3019,Mickey's,2.47,pours out of the can a crystal clear light yellowgold with a fizzy head that dissipates quickly smells malty and grainy not too crazy tastes follows the nose but the back end has a bit of bitterness good carbonation that gives it a good mouthfeel that keeps you wanting another sip surprisingly a good beer
3020,Mickey's,3.1,thicker slightly heavier version of a miller high life imo on par with colt 45 possibly better would revisit and recommend thick lasting head good lacing good sweet malted barley and maize taste good product from enclosed case of 6 pack grenade bottles best by december 2022
3021,Mickey's,4.96,my first time it sorta resembles normal american beers but more flavor
3022,Mickey's,3.53,pours a brilliant gold colour with a nice head that evaporated almost instantly smells cheap and syrupy the taste is ok way better than i was expecting i get sweet notes and corny notes it seems thick and viscous dry mouthfeel june 30 2022
3023,Mickey's,3.32,the king of this category for me the old pulltab bigmouths flew down the throat throughout high school and college stung by the bee way too many times and dont regret a thing
3024,Zenne Y Frontera,4.6,1819 blend 93
3025,Zenne Y Frontera,4.31,blend n94 season 1819 drank 020223 out of a hill farmstead oversized wine glass  look  no head and little carb gold color smell  distinctly lambic taste  acid too much at cellar temp but when it got to room temp it was more tasty but still too much on the sour side for my taste feel  medium mouthfeel with low carbonation overall  just too sour and acidly of a lambic for me to really enjoy i need to give another blend another shot just to see if it was this batch or if zenne might not be my thing
3026,Zenne Y Frontera,4.77,a pours crystal clear dark golden yellow almost amber small fizzy white head that dissipates quickly 425  s aroma is tart lactic acidity a big minerality some plastic like funk notes only the faintest barnyard characters mild sherry notes give it a subtle fruitiness a bit of spice on the finish like white pepper 475  t taste is immediately wildly complex theres a sweetness up front followed by a sour tart punch then lingering oaky vanilla on the finish that lasts forever its not as aggressively tart as some lambicsgueuzes likely subdued by the cask asking other characters i get are red grapes tart citrus moderate spice just fantastic so much going on and the finish is divine 5  md mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation lower than most in the style but insanely drinkable 425  o a gem of a beer well worth the hype an elite beer 475
3027,Black Tuesday - Reserve,3.64,look  black and thick with a nice tan head and sticy lacing smell  so much barrel taste  booze booze booze barrel and chocolate but overly boozy feel  thick slight carb overall  the booze is killing this beer
3028,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.75,2020 version poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter bottle 1041 dated 2112020 an absolute beast boozy thick and mildly sweet
3029,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.75,2021 vintage bottle share at a bottle share on 12322 amazing beer drank fairly easily and just a ton of flavour and barrel in the taste it was a little on the boozy side not terrible but id expect that from a 21 abv beer
3030,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.52,2020 vintage  oh man we have quite the big boy here a 21 on a tuesday afternoon what the hell am i doing well im on vacation this week and today turned out to be a stormy day so i figured its the perfect time to crack this beer i received in a bif from the legendary eziel im getting close to the end of what he sent me and theyre all heavy hitters lets see what this one is all about  pours a very dark brown with a finger of light beige head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  theres a definite sweetness in the nose but its wonderfully balanced given its size im picking up on aromas of chocolate fudge earthy bourbon toasted oak nougat black cherry sweet caramel molasses toasted hazelnut and light vanilla  this one really packs a punch in taste heavy booze and char fight for attention while a huge sweetness backs it all up on the front end of the sip im tasting charred oak cacao sweet bourbon red grape marshmallow sweet vanilla molasses toffee light nutty malt and black cherry the swallow brings notes of hot bourbon charred oak nougat cacao black cherry molasses apple brandy vanilla sweet caramel and nougat  a full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a silky and slightly thick beer finishes mostly dry but boozy as all hell  theres no 2 ways about it this beer is incredible so complex and hitting all the right notes perfect for a quiet day to myself hanging out outside while it rains
3031,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.22,2021 batch most of the bt reserve years is two sets of bourbon barrels but this one is grape brandy and then bourbon  this one pours a very dark black color with a small head and no lacing  this smells like charred oak lots of bourbon lots of vinous grape character brandy roasted malt dark fruit  this is a nice bridge between some of overtly wine based black tuesday variants and the regular bourbon black tuesday the grape brandy adds a pleasantly oaky vinous character sweet but finishes dry with oaky char marshmallow dark chocolate caramel roast and bourbon  this is medium bodied slightly thin as most black tuesday variants tend to be with a lots of concentrated booziness its not overwhelmingly boozy but it really kind of does drink like a distilled stout liqueur  i havent had much bruery in a while but this was definitely a fun beer to revisit this brewery with its definitely something to share with a bunch of people like 10 people maybe but its well done
3032,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.56,750 ml wax capped bottle 2021 edition aged in copper  kings grape brandy barrels for a year then aged an additional year in bourbon barrels 218 abv bottled 011921 served in a black tuesday chalice the beer pours dark brownblack with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away somewhat quickly i like the aroma a lot the brew smells like dark fruit brandy bourbon vanilla molasses dark chocolate and roasted malt i like the taste a lot too its similar to the aroma but with the addition of some dark bread burntcharred malt coffee licorice and earthy flavors theres a lot going on here but all of the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others mouthfeelbody is full its coating and a bit syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation nowhere near as boozy as i was expecting considering how strong this brew is certainly worth trying if you get the chance to
3033,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.33,i believe this was a 2018 bottle 4 years aged leaned towards a more licorice flavor didnt pick up much bourbon solid beerliquor drink 20 its hard to still consider this a beer my guess is that perhaps its a little better if it were fresher maybe 612mo age which is generally where i like my ba stouts
3034,Minhas Light,2.25,just a light beer 20100906
3035,Minhas Light,1.5,blech
3036,Minhas Light,2.6,poured from a can into a pint glass  appearance  the beer pours a light golden color with a fizzy white head the head fades super fast leaving almost no lace on the sides of the glass  smell the aroma of the brew is mostly of a corn smell mixed with a little bit of a musty aroma  tastethe taste begins with a sweeter corn syrup taste mixed with a little bit of a grain as the taste moves on some lighter flavors of caramel and even more corn come to the tongue in the end one is left with a somewhat more sweet corn cereal taste to linger on the tongue  mouthfeel  the body of the brew is very thin and light with a carbonation level that is rather average the thin body is prime for the sweeter and subdued tastes of the brew a little higher carbonation would have been slightly better for the lightness of the brew but even so the feel was alright overall  overall  for a 4 abv brew that clocks in at only 95 calories i am not going to expect a flavor powerhouse nothing is really off in the taste but nothing is really on either it is sort a standard light brew overall
3037,Minhas Light,2.85,poured from a 12 oz can has a pale yellow color with a 12 inch head smell has some light hints of corn but is odorless for the most part taste has more flavor than i expected corn grains some malts a bit of green apples feels light in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer considering the brewery and the beer style mediocre is pretty good in this case
3038,Minhas Light,3.23,wellbetter than bud light and quite honestly if u drink light beer this is a good alternative to the big brand guys it has better flavor and ur paying 950 for 24 beers
3039,Minhas Light,2.92,appearance  light yellow very clear and very bubbly short and very shortlived sudsy white head  smell  light and very sweet pale malts corn and candy  taste  sweet and corny but obviously quite light light pale malts with no apparent hops character slight metallic tang and a little bit of a cloying aftertaste  mouthfeel  light and crisp  overall  pretty inoffensive and refreshing judging by some of minhas other efforts this could be much worse as is its a decent low priced stand in for the more flavorful of the macrolager lights
3040,Minhas Light,1.9,bought a case a few weeks ago it was cheap and i didnt really want to spend too much on beer at the time 10 dollars for a 30 pack will do  not even going to pour this into a glass its not worth it  smell very fruity thats about all i get fruitiness and maybe the slightest bit of a used up hop smell  taste well its light alright water fruit corn and a ghosting of stale hops cant really expect too much from this  mouthfeel decently carbonated and very thin watery the whole way through it goes down very easy to say the least  overall its not vomitrocious its not good either i cant say i will be picking this one up again
3041,Minhas Light,1.66,so it was 229 for a 6 pack decided to take a shot with the goading of my coworker  pours super pale yellow huge head that actually leaves a bit of lacing on the plastic hotel cup im classy fuck you  smell is umnot pleasant something offputting about it not beery at all  taste is well ive had worse tastes like a macro light no worse than bud light and a crap load cheaper  mouthfeel is water strike that its carbonated water kinda like h2oh if youve ever had that  drinkability ive already 4 in and have one more to finish along with 2 more new glarus the fact that i can still type after 10 beers in the last hour says to me that it is pretty sessionable not that it tastes good but at this point im really not getting the full flavor and it hasnt made me puke yet so bottoms up  in short cheap beer not objectionable if you are just looking to get hammered in the cheapest way possible and you have something against malt liquor but if you want beer then dont buy this
3042,Minhas Light,1.73,bought a case of this 24pack for 5 bucks hard to beat that  a pale yellow a bit of fizzy head that immediately reduces to nothing  s doesnt smell like much maybe a bit of hops mixed with lots of water  t tastes just like it smells like water and bit of sweetness coming from something the good news is it doesnt leave too much of an aftertaste  m the mouthfeel put water in your mouth and see for yourself  d this beer is pretty sessionable for me while i dont think the taste is great the lack of a bad aftertaste is a plus for me and i have no problem throwing 1015 of these back in a night i cant say the same about some other macro brews  if you are looking for the cheapest reasonable beer possible to get drunk id recommend minhas it definitely isnt any worse than your typical macro brews but about a third of the price if you are looking for good beer avoid at all costs
3043,Punkuccino,3.86,12 oz bottle from the elysian pumpkin mixed 12pack poured into a snifter copper color with a creamy head  almost nitrolike or cappuccinolike aroma and flavor feature pumpkin spice sweet cream caramel malt toffee and bitter almost burnt coffee mouthfeel is excellent very smooth full and creamy solid overall and if not for the burnt character this would be even better
3044,Punkuccino,4.19,from a 12oz bottle marked exp by 06 jan24 poured into a tulip only the appearance is unremarkable here dark mahogany but little head and what there is disappears quickly no lacing smell and flavor as advertised but thankfully the cinnamon is subtle abundant pumpkin plus coffee and some vanilla the lactose additions adds heft to the body overall a nice twist on a pumpkin ale but not as good as their great pumpkin imperial ale
3045,Punkuccino,3.66,aroma of harsh espresso and juicy pumpkin bar bodys much the same an immediate onset of mocha and espresso followed by thick sumptuous pumpkin bar pastry with some chocolate on the side not bad not very complex but smooth and straightforward
3046,Punkuccino,4.72,i know this is elysian and its a popular brewery that was purchased by miller so i heard the name of the beer and the description and honestly thought this beer was a joke pumpkin coffee stout come on this beer is going to be rank no one can pull this off oh contraire  smell is pumpkin but you get undertones of coffee like a perfect balance how is that taste is is equally balanced nice pumpkinq flavoring without being overpowering or tasting fake a beer like this has to be so hard to nail down and they did it standing ovation
3047,Punkuccino,3.21,super dark brown but not quite black thick tan head excellent retention spotty lace smells like coffee with heavy pumpkin spice tastes like an old pumpkin spice latte that was a little shy on the milk rich medium heavy body appropriately lower carbonation not my thing
3048,Punkuccino,4.19,black coffee color with a decent tan head and bits of nice lacing the aroma is coffee and pumpkin pie not bad the taste follows with pumpkin pie leading followed by coffee with a touch of cream very nice the body is light medium light carbonation smooth and very drinkable altogether this makes for one of the best pumpkin brews i have tried excellent
3049,Punkuccino,4.2,deep brown not totally opaque though decent head and some minor lacing a little pumpkin pie on the nose blackened toast and pumpkin pie flavors are present lightly carbonated and light feeling pretty good beer among elysian pumpkin ales this is second best
3050,Polar Pilsen,2.58,from a bottle clear golden color with a few white bubbles skunky aroma light body with good carbonation tastes of grain and corn with a bitter finish average euro lager a tick mark for venezuela anyway
3051,Polar Pilsen,3.74,cerveza polar i would say is one of the most popular beers in venezuela although there are other brands polar is the favorite and first choice talking about this beer light yellow color refreshing abv 45 taste good nothing remarkable birra for everyone and everyday cheers a couple of days later im going to taste polar 1941 special edition abv 7 then i would tell you how it goes
3052,Polar Pilsen,2.27,date july 25 2022 occasion our first night in aruba is a successtime to celebrate with a beer i havent had in more than two decades glassware nondescript 10 oz pokal a picture of consistency its light golden amber body builds a bank of soft craggy head that leaves behind articulate lacingattractive save for the lack of effervescence sharp sweet malts burnt toffee a bit of weirdly expressed bitterness candied sugars and perfumed hops make this a beer that sends a drink me quickly message beefier than expected it holds its place long enough after the initial sip to leave a softer grainy finish a bit more than a rinser the malts are slightly burnt sweet and almost chewablestriking for a beer that otherwise requires a tropical setting to be enjoyed i dont mind that i waited this long to review a beer i innocently randomly ordered in russellsit most likely tastes better in the setting were in now
3053,Polar Pilsen,2.58,pretty bad essentially less nose than michael jackson low on flavor tastes like cheap 28oz clearglass lager in the hood in august feel is fine for 8oz but it gets flat quick wouldnt really purchase this with my own money by choice if there were other options
3054,Polar Pilsen,4,found this in a grocery store in the caribbean a while back and it was cheap crisp and refreshing  perfect for a warm summer day surprisingly good for the price if youre looking for a lighter beer thats hoppier than an american light beer
3055,Polar Pilsen,2.78,the pour is from an 8 oz can thats rather small  interesting oh look there is a cute polar bear on the front of the can  the beer pour a medium flow of carbonation with a white foamy head that dies down rather quickly i do notice a best by date on the bottom of the can which indicates that theyre giving this beer a long shelf life the aroma is of grains with faint corn in the background the taste matches the nose but its subpar compared to many other pilsner beers that ive had in the past i dont know if this beer is brewed in aruba venezuela or florida but wherever its from it needs a tweak here  there  its not a disgusting pilsner nor is it a tasty one either cheers c
3056,Polar Pilsen,1.75,cerveza con cabeza visible tiene un cuerpo ligero y es de carbonataci√≥n alta en su aroma se percibe granos mantequilla y jarabe de ma√≠z una vez en boca destaca el jarabe y una sensaci√≥n herb√°cea
3057,Jakobus,3.98,on tap pale straw with maybe just a bare impression of haze and a sustained full thin white cap nose is a lemon citrus grain when cold taste at this time is a slightly stale white bread with a mix of lemon and orange zest carbonation is medium heft is light and finish is pretty dry and dry grass bitterness  a peppery note comes out in the nose as it warms and sweet bread flavor starts to gain on the citrus during this time the balance works itself into an enjoyable experience by a third of the way down the glass
3058,Jakobus,4.27,lightly foggy yellowgold with a dense head of white foam  rounded malt characteristics of corn nut and white wheat are contrasted by a pleasantly grassy bite
3059,Jakobus,4.16,poured from a 16 oz can dated 062923 so 4 weeks into the test glass a  beautiful looking offering clear excellent carbonation works in the lemon straw colored backdrop a tight knit white cap rides the drink to the last sip s  floral up front with lemongrass being prominent with some time there is a lovely grain  cracker baguette crust thread as the offering warms a bit there is more noble grassy spring hops in the nose t  more grainy flavors on the palate but al in that tight window of crusty bread cracker the lemon drp aspect transfers well and balances out the offering m  snappy those hops keep this on the bitter side of the knives edge with that grain aspect being adding some needed heft dry finish pulls you toward another sip o  a very snappy bright german style pils one that rewards with every sip
3060,Jakobus,4.59,an easy pour produced a finger of creamy and soapy white foam with very long retention and swatches of lacing clear goldenstraw body with a few fastrising fine bubbles  cracker greets the nose first followed closely by toasted wheat bread and dough floral and herbal hops  semidry with big hop flavor yet moderate bitterness at first matching the smell closely toasted grains are added to the malt taste grass and a hint of lemon joins the hops a white peppery spicy bitterness builds in the finish is dry clean crisp and softens quickly peppery spice lingers briefly  medium light bodied with lots of carbonation a moderate pour yielded a 3finger head great balance alcohol is very well hidden overall bitterness is on the high side but so is the malt flavor true to style thanks to quality ingredients and skillful brewing
3061,Jakobus,4.6,can clear gold with ring and island my dishwasher is broken and my glass was not perfectly clean earthy noble grassy aroma with hints of honey medium sweet grainy honey with a touch of light toast spicy finish cleans it all up and lingers long enough to satisfy but not too long lively but not fizzy and light excellent
3062,Jakobus,4.4,canned 20230321 pours a fizzy bubbly 12 finger head with fair retention low lacing very clear blond light pale color  nose plenty of grainysweet malt rich grain straw bread dough cereal a bit of decoction like malt depth hint of floral hops with some lemonlime notes  taste brings more malts up front cereal crackery grainysweet malts doughy a bit of straw more layered decoction mash character very soft up front fair herbal floral hops getting a little grassy spicy late hint of lemonlime as well medlighter bitterness gradually increasing and then kicks in with a high spicy hop bitterness on the crisp finish long finish as well  mouth is med to a bit lighter bod very soft and delicate med carb  overall very nice german pilsner with unique addition of that lemonlime character but otherwise nails it again
3063,Tecate Light,2.8,pale gold in color theres a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering a quarter of the top in small splotchy areas theres a touch of soapy lacing on my glass the aroma is of corn im tasting a touch of corn and a suggestion of grassy hops the mouth is thin and watery
3064,Tecate Light,2.75,can pour into a pint glass clear golden appearance with a modest soapy head that recedes quickly to a surface film and collar celery scallion metallic notes light body light carbonation
3065,Tecate Light,2.58,12oz can best by september 2023 fresh  on the pour a very light straw yellow body with about 2 fingers of mixed fine and fizzy head was present that quickly became rocky and started dissipating carbonation extremely high head settles at a thin bubbly covering  aroma is somewhere between the generic beer lager smell and sweet corn straight from the can a touch of sulfur  flavor is very sweet but much better poured in a glass than straight out of the can there is some light dms but it seems to fade quite a bit when poured in a glass the taste is quite sweet and corny  feel initially implies a full corny almost syrupy flavor but a dry astringency quickly creeps in still the finish is surprisingly long for 39 abv almost too long and this beer is only really refreshing poured in a glass  overall compared to standard tecate this is a disappointment not nearly as good of a lager but the flavor is still full if not a bit off for a light beer this is a bit heavy
3066,Tecate Light,3.11,can purchased from muelle de pescadores in isla mujeres mexico  this one pours a very light yellow color with a small head and lots of lacing  this smells like corn and grain and not much else  this isnt the best but sitting on the beach on a hot day with some tacos it does ok theres not much to it its slightly grainy and slightly corny and mostly just watery  this is very light bodied crisp mostly clean and pretty drinkable  like a lot of mexican beers this is completely location dependent if youre drinking it in mexico youre probably having a good time and youre gonna like it no matter what
3067,Tecate Light,2.99,had on tap straw in color with almost no head light on the smell malt slight sweet slightly sweet on the flavor malt and grain more flavorful than expected light and smooth
3068,Tecate Light,2.67,l pours a very pale straw yellow with a white bubbly head that dissipates quickly  s smells like a cheap light lager notes of corn sweet apple maybe a touch of hop  t a touch watery notes of corn and sweet apple a maybe a very light hop definitely tastes like a cheap light lager  f light and crisp very easy drinking  o while not great this is better than some of the light beers
3069,Tecate Light,2,so before ordering this i was served a strong margarita and decided that i needed to slow my roll but keep drinking enter tecate light it pours straw yellow with a head that vanishes faster than the beer nothing to report on the smell just typical light lager scents tastewise its a metal can with corn notes that tastes like strange tap water now maybe i am being harsh but it did go down smooth as its under 4 and is practically a water not good if youre looking for flavor and body in your beer but great after getting knocked down by a heavy marg
3070,Tecate Light,3.34,look clear straw gold loose white head that dissipates after a few minutes  smell light sulfur mineral water not a lot going on  taste since they cut calories with the abv and kept more carbs its way more flavorful than i expected theres the typical corn adjunct some breadiness a little earthy hops and a crisp dry finish its not outstanding but theres no way i can call it awful at 39 you could drink this all day long i am pleasantly surprised if your into micheladas this would be a great starting pointe if you dont know what they are mix 13 clamato with 23 beer add some tabasco if you like it spicier ive also made them with the same ratio and zing zang bloody mary mix
3071,Union Jack IPA,4.21,this is an ultra classic american ipa with a surprising hop balance that results in a candied pineapple and pine profile that is more than the sum of its parts the color is an immaculate clear gold without a trace of the lazy hazy a really wonderful effort that has stood the test of time
3072,Union Jack IPA,4.03,pours a clear orangeyellow frothy 05 of head that settles to a thick collar of foam nose is spicy piney resinous hop and a fair amount of malt sweetness for balance as it warms some more tropical juice notes as well taste follows but expresses more of the spice and resin than the tropical aspects finish is relatively dry with a clean and crisp mouthfeel its really solid and reliable
3073,Union Jack IPA,3.72,had this on tap and it pours very well decent head retention and good lacing as you drink smell is barely there for an ipa but tastes great not too bitter and the hops really stand out doesnt feel too full but not light either perfect for a beer before dinner
3074,Union Jack IPA,4.27,undated 12oz can single purchase hazy gold one finger off white head leaves a nicely laced glass terrific aromas of pineapple citrus and pine buds get big citrus flavors excellent carbonation medium bodied i rarely see fw beers in my neck of the woods od like to try this fresh
3075,Union Jack IPA,4.04,12oz can into new belgium globe  a  1finger of white over a semicloudy body of amber moderate visible carbonation  s  sweetness pine tropical fruits  t  honey sweetness pine tropical fruits maybe a little earthy bright and fruity nice balance between sweetness and bitterness dry finish  m  medium body medium carbonation smooth and creamy  o  balanced and refreshing
3076,Union Jack IPA,4,solid west coast ipa
3077,Union Jack IPA,4.33,poured from a 12 ounce can into a shaker pint glass there is no best by date that i can see  appearance pours a clear copper color with onefinger offwhite head that slowly dissipated until a thin broken layer of small bubbles remained lighter carbonation there is moderate lacing on the glass  smell initially sweet honey then equal parts pine resin and pineapple citrus  taste the taste follows the nose initially sweet honey then pine resin and pineapple citrus on the finish  palate medium body and lighter carbonation and somewhat creamy  overall this is a very well balanced ipa its hoppy but does not overpower your palate and sweet but not too sweet i really enjoyed this and will seek it out again i would recommend to anyone who enjoys a more balanced ipa
3078,Amsterdam Maximator,1.92,way to sweet and taste like a european old english from a plastic bottle horrible
3079,Amsterdam Maximator,1.75,june 2007 500 ml can supplied by my friend olav brewed by dutch export breweries abv was 116 golden colour moderate head weak aroma a hint of white wine and honey very sweet and alcoholic flavour pretty bad
3080,Amsterdam Maximator,1.43,managed to get to the review box without seeing previous onesyesss its difficult  left out the fridge for 30 minutes before drinking  initial impressions i do not like the green can much for me green is not beer its the devil or maybe wheatgrass juice or broccoli  for a strong beer at 116 it is very light basically like a lager with a bit more colour head goes down fast  aroma has no fruitiness nothing complexjust fizziness and a hint of sawdust  not looking forward much to the taste  taste is intense spirit like much better than a lager like carlsberg or heineken as at least there is taste though the taste is alcohol almost vodka and not a complex brewed taste with lots of flavour this is obviously made for the alcohol not the taste the perfect beer for someone who hates their life wants to get drunk forget things and who wants to save money as much as possible  would i drink if i was homeless for sure there is fuck all else to do and i probably do not want to break another tooth opening a bottle of chimnay bleu  the taste has elements of honey lots of sweetness surprising for such a strong beer  its my opinion that the ingredients are false they have basically mixed beer with pure alcohol and sugar therefore alcohol should be on the ingredients perhaps they do not have to add this as a seperate onehaha clever  this has not been brewed it has been mixed  still its better than a mass produced lager though really it is the same just mixed with alcohol so it gets a pretty low rating from me
3081,Amsterdam Maximator,2.51,my thats some alcohol burn you got therevery malty lager with lots of heat looks good though with nice thick creamy head but then again youre not drinking this for taste you want a buzzand youll get it
3082,Amsterdam Maximator,1.42,truly horrible bought as a curiosity from a french supermarket shelf  trampagne at its most cynical maximum alcoholic units per buck formula  curiously syrupy when overchilled freezer incident  avoid
3083,Amsterdam Maximator,2.87,tastes very sweet you can feel the alcohol
3084,Amsterdam Maximator,2.95,this one should just fall into the malt liquor category picked this up from a small store in paris for a good cheap buzz before heading out its got a very strong malty bready flavor and a lit of heat from the alcohol as it warmed not gonna lie i was expecting a lot worse after seeing the score on ba but hey i didnt mind it tastes much better out of a can not worthy of a bock glass
3085,Amsterdam Maximator,2.06,another can brought back from the south of france in sep 13 this 500ml monster was cracked open on 2 dec 13 well before its expiry date  poured twice into a la chouffe tulip at home  bright light goldenamber with a deep head on each pour the heads tried to hang around for a while too  a hangover in a single can smells grainy tinny and alcoholic tastes grainy tinny and alcoholic palate wise i thought it grainy tinny and alcoholic overall it was grainy tinny and alcoholic  it actually got a little better as it warmed and my second glass was almost pleasantwell almost
3086,Amsterdam Maximator,1.45,got this one in normandy at a grocery store this one is max intense described as a beer rich in ingredients with a long brewing process  from a 50cl can into a pint glass  appearance pours a three finger loose looking white head with decent retention really loose and chunky looking perfectly clear amber orange with medium carbonation force carbonated fades to a chunky wisp and leaves foamy chunky wisp on the sides of the glass splotchy wisp leaves some foamy lacing down the glass  smell bread and grainy malts corn and some alcohol  taste rough going boozy and sweet grain up front with sweet bread and corn into the finish a bolder finish is boozy with alcohol corn and sweet grainy malts not pleasant in the least harsh  palate medium body and carbonation a little light goes down airy and bubbly with a harsh burn at swallow and finishes slightly sweet on palate some alcohol lingers  overall not a doppelbock at all this is simply a strong euro pale lager and a really strong one at that i guess its better than malt liquor but the only reason one would even consider drinking this would be to get mashed on the cheap i cant believe a brewer would taste this and go yes this is exactly what i wanted
3087,120 Minute IPA,4.32,12 ounce bottle into a tulip snifter bottled 33017 had 5322  pours a somewhat cloudy medium amber with a quarter inch foamy head and some spotty cling aromas of caramel malt brown sugar some pine some raisins light figs and dates pretty similar flavors caramel pine malt brown sugar light raisins and dates tastes a little bit herbal with a light hop bitterness and some alcohol warming as it warms smooth for the abv a very good medium body appropriately carbonated  wow this really does age well lots of caramel malt and pine need to buy this more often really enjoyable
3088,120 Minute IPA,4.81,this beer is so unique that its hard to describe it really is nothing short of incredible and worth every penny of the price i paid for it if youre lucky enough to find a four pack of this in the store dont even hesitate just buy it
3089,120 Minute IPA,4.13,52023 poured from a 12 oz bottle purchased at the denny house waynesburg pagala night for the way  pours a strange not bad deep amber orange color very little head or lacing  hints of sweetness with the very chewy beer pine and pineapple smooth hoppy bite  special beer and a fun night
3090,120 Minute IPA,4,12oz bottle poured into a snifter 2017 vintage 5 years old  a the most vigorous pour i could muster did not turn up any head deep brown in color with good clarity i half expected sediment but there really isnt any not much in the way of lacing either a few tiny specs  s a lot of raw honey apricot malty aromas of fig jam and a pop of berry highly estery with pineappletropical notes orange marmalade complete with peels earthy and leafy notes with that aged forest floor character treacle and a hint of toastcrust  t follows the nose lots of raw honey up front figs and berries richer malty notes of molasses and toasted crust and scones very tropical and estery big notes of pineapple starfruit papaya orange marmalade hit of warming alcohol downright spicy with herbal oiliness earthy and leafy dose of musty book and nutty sherry oxidation aggressive spicyoily hop finish with trailing alcohol heat and figgy malt  m very thick with a ton of coating residual sugar it is syrupy in texture good pressing sense of weight carbonation is fading but theres still some fine pricking around the tip of the tongue gritty hop astringency  o this beer becomes very interesting with age it might be an acquired taste for those who prefer ipas fresh though it becomes a three way brawl between a brawny malt character aggressively estery alcohol and a good dose of oilyspicy hops age has deepened that malt into a lot of fruity complexity brought out more earthy forest floor hop notes and a lot of musty and sherrylike oxidation its also hot and a bit much when fresh though something like 13 years of age may be the sweet spot for me i think but it comes down to preferences it certainly isnt bad now
3091,120 Minute IPA,4.29,well well 15 for this one had to try it nice experience after a hard day of work but no sir it aint for me tastes like a bitter honey syrup low to no carbonation definitely worth to try once
3092,120 Minute IPA,3.99,yea this ipa is an icon however not the most drinkable ipa for the masses your wife nor girlfriend will like this beer i have heard the term robitussin voiced however you as a beer drinker must try it at least once ive tried it several timesheavy and alcoholic are the first terms that come to mind refreshing no tasty yes everyday no
3093,120 Minute IPA,4,pours a cloudy copper thin foam very chunky cider aroma huge malt and hop flavor simultaneously very heavy sweet alcohol cider finish not really you typical ipa and not something i would drink regularly definitely worth a try though
3094,120 Minute IPA,2.9,the 90min ipa tastes so much better than the 60min that i assumed the 120min would be amazing perhaps i have an unrefined pallet but it tastes like a poorly made overly alcoholic mixed drink i would have made in college circa 2006 worth a try but i wont be having this ever again
3095,120 Minute IPA,4.1,got a couple of bottles of this as an xmas gift bottles a year or two old this is the 2021 release poured into pint glass pours a dark rich copper tone the short offwhite head dissipates quickly but leaves a nice ring and dense lacing smells a little like apple cider i take a sip malt malt and its punching me in the face much maltier than it is hoppy a logical progression from the 90 minute ipa which holds the two in balance i wasnt sure i liked it until i kept drinking and decided i definitely do very sweet brings a caramel apple to mind and then you get piney notes on the back end to remind you youre drinking an ipa a little alcoholic which works here i wouldnt mind it being more bitter perfectly carbonated with a full body its a strange ipa a prior reviewer said it reminded them of a barleywine which does track another reviewer said its not an ipa and im not sure im equipped to argue with them im not sure what it is though other than very good while i do appreciate a beer that is what it says it is i can also respect a beer that dares to push limits especially when its this good
3096,120 Minute IPA,4.18,first this bottle is very old not sure how old but could possibly be around a dozen years old still have another bottle so with that preface  pours a dark copper like dark apple cider opaque small brown head that dissipated quickly leaving a collar  aroma of malt dark fruit mild alcohol dark sugar spice and somewhat herbal  taste is dark fruit alcohol but not overpowering apples prunes caramel bread bitter orange dates and pine  mouthfeel is medium bodied and cleansing nicely smooth in the mouth  overall very interesting hides the alcohol well and rather complex flavor notes
3097,120 Minute IPA,4.28,as per plan this is the xmas celebration beer the last holdout from the extreme box bottled on 91319 a little over three years old it pours a deep coppery color into the tulip with lots of head that fades off rapidly into a partial top cloud and ring it has a sweet syrupy and malty smell it does taste sweet more sweet than bitter the bitterness is slighty lingering around a slight alcohol taste i think its like butterscotch and caramel up front its a little fruity definitely along the barleywine track fairly thick syrupy easy to drink but warming moderately carbonated and somewhat dry very interesting  i would love to do a vertical taste test the last time i had this was in 2019 at a tasting event that also served utopias its powerful im really out of the race at this point
3098,120 Minute IPA,1,this is in no way an ipa its false advertisement and a horrible beer product for 1112 per bottle its all hypegimmick its not satisfying at all its over the top in the worst way should be discontinued
3099,120 Minute IPA,4.73,the 2022 version is the best iteration of this beer that ive had the hops and malt are in perfect balance for an imperial ipa
3100,120 Minute IPA,4.15,there is no rational reason to have more than one of these per occasion so one brown twelve ounce bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass almost no head was produced and it vanished almost instantaneously forget about the head because the brew is beautiful anyway its bright copperamber and its on the translucent side malt is the predominant smell with hints of alcohol and hops of course theres an alcoholic aspect to the taste thats too big to ignore after all the abv here is an incredible 18 percent considering that this tastes so much better than some that are less potent but taste like a shot of whisky was dropped into the beer this is malty in the scottish ale way sweetly and with a kick the hops are there for some counterbalance and they add an enjoyable extra layer of taste but this is malt and alcohol driven its good for what it is an attempt at making an incredibly high abv brew that tastes good to that point this is a success for others in this range almost never taste this good but for most beer drinkers even those that can enjoy an imperial ipa or stout in the 810 abv range this is a little much there reaches a point when this much alcohol reduces the beer drinking experience and this might be it
3101,Nectarine Premiere,4.41,poured from a 750ml bottle into an oversized wine glass  look a hazy orange with a very thin white head that dissipates quickly  smell sweet and fresh nectarine hits the nose immediately this fades into a buttery oak with some hay like funk a little salty and mildly acidic  taste nectarine juice shocks the palate that fades to a buttery oak this is punched aside by a lightly briny sour note that fades to more nectarine stone fruit notes on the finish  feel bright clean mildly acidic no alcohol noted light carbonation  overall a beautiful and clean sour the brewery really knows what they are doing
3102,Nectarine Premiere,4.39,62019 batch sweet and tart fruityyeasty funky a hint of oakbarrel and a nice and sweet nectarine stonefruity nose on this one nice aromatics taste follows with a wellbalanced slightly briny oak and underripe tart nectarine finish the oak barrel is pretty well integrated at this pointi was just hoping for a little more jammysweet nectarine on the palate delicious
3103,Nectarine Premiere,3.76,1021
3104,Nectarine Premiere,4.51,bottled september 2020  alright folks here we are the final bif beer i received from eziel its been a wild 6 months of hard to find beers and were ending with the heaviest hitter of the bunch this is currently the 5th highest rated saison on ba and 52nd overall those are some impressive stats also im not sure if ive ever seen a beer fruited with only nectarine its usually a blend lets get into it  pours an opaque orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that very quickly fizzes away to nothing and leaves no lacing  sheesh less than stellar appearance aside this is bold in the nose just super fruity and tart with a big funk too im picking up on aromas of sweet nectarine wet hay tart apricot sharp oak lemon yogurt wildflower honey straw and crackery malt  oh man the funk is even punchier in taste but not in a way thats out of balance on the front end of the sip im tasting tart peach lemon juice white wine vinegar stone sharp oak nectarine wet hay honey and lemongrass the swallow brings notes of wet hay stone white wine vinegar peach pit nectarine sharp oak crackery malt lemon yogurt and light orange juice  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a sharp and zippy beer finishes bone dry with a lovely balance of sour fruit and funk  wow this is one hell of a beer its highly complex yet i could chug it but why would i do that i plan on nursing this bottle over the course of the night
3105,Racer 5,1.41,i rated this great west coast ipa years ago with a rating over 44 under a now lost username i have some bad news about my favorite northern california ipa bear republic brewing co of cloverdale california was acquired by drakes brewing co of san leandro california early in 2023 newspaper stories of the time stated that drakes would be brewing racer 5 again from their brewery in san leandro drakes acquired all of the bear republic intellectual property including recipes trademarks and packaging rights well that was the story at least i was a purchaser of racer 5 in 12pack bottles the cardboard boxes stated that it was brewed in sonoma county on june 12 of 2023 i purchased what i believed to be bear republic racer 5 ipa this cardboard box claimed racer 5 was brewed in san jose with a bottling date of may 11 2023 the brew contained in these bottles was not the same racer 5 that i dearly loved the substantial layer of brewers yeast at the bottom of each bottle was gone meaning that this brew was no longer a genuine bottleconditioned ipa the head was gone carbonation was nearly flat the fullbodied ipa was now thin and watered down like any cheap canned ipa odd smell and offtaste the complex hops profile was absent and now tasted suspiciously of citra or galaxy i made a call to drakes and they told me that racer 5 was now brewed by gordon biersch of san jose they assured me that when drakes started production of racer 5 the boxes would be marked as brewed in san leandro thats the miserable end of racer 5 for me i will watch for future production of racer 5 from san leandro should that actually happen sorry to be the bearer no pun intended of bad news
3106,Racer 5,3.65,aroma was malty and slightly piney medium carb two finger head taste  very malty bready and thick with butterscotch notes lots of sticky piney hop bittering not sure how this differs from a new england ipa but nonetheless it aint no west coast ipa despite the fact its brewed on the west coast so i guess for the style is right on this is a classic ipa from bear republic so definitely a must try if youre an ipa connoissieur
3107,Racer 5,5,pours a delightful hazy orange with a voluminous offwhite head that lasts giving epic lacing smell is sweet caramel oranges apricots and slight honeydew taste follows the smell nicely with no off flavors a bit less honeydew in the taste and a bit more apricot and orange sweet or perhaps semisweet maltforward but still quite hoppy with a lasting bitter finish feel is very smooth and fullbodied carbonation is moderate and just right for this style abv is there but not pressing overall an underrated oldschool westcoast ipa that is a must try for all diehard ipa lovers
3108,Racer 5,3.86,poured from an unfortunately undated 16oz can  on the first pour an insane four finger head formed pretty good retention too as it took me 6ish minutes to pour the whole pint into a spieglau ipa glass after pouring i had a stiff rocky white sudsy head that left foamy lacing body is a hazy golden yellow  aroma comes off as sweet in a big beer sense but is immediately followed by big resiny hops with rhindy citrus notes in the back like if pine sap was lemon scented super hoppy but in a fresh herbal way a touch of ale character in the way back  flavor is smooth and drinkable with a wave of bitterness tasting notes mostly follow the aroma but the sweetness dissapears completely due to the bitterness full flavor implies a maltiness but the hops cover up any true malt character as typical for the style lemony pine resin with a dry malt insinuating finish is the main experience  feel is drinkable verging on dangerous for the abv very easy to drink and quite smooth although the finish is quite dry and bitter the dryness begins verging on astringency and im unsure if that is due to hopping rates or something else very full with a medium long finish  overall this is a decent legacy ipa its super drinkable very beery and pretty enjoyable bright herbal citric and overall hoppy this is what i thought an ipa tasted like when my mom explained hops to me as a kid and i still didnt appreciate beer classic old school ipa this is what a wcipa should be imo
3109,Racer 5,3.79,pours a golden color with a finger soapy head  smells very bready with some piney undertones  taste is of grapefruit pine and very feint citrus bubblegummy after taste with little to no bite
3110,Racer 5,4.49,been some time since had a racer 5  san francisco 2017 pours a bright very slightly hazed golden with solid two fingers of tight bubbly just off white head aroma of bready malt floral with touch of pine and big swath of orange tangerine and tropical fruit  underwhelming at first but popped as warmed just a touch this is on me tastes an explosion of hops  citrus a bit of pine fruity with notes of mango tangerine certainly a floral presence and a bright spicy bitterness that coats the palate balanced by bready caramel malt sweetness medium full mouthfeel with a coating bittersweetness that lingers nicely this is a classic for a reason and on a short list of desert island beers
3111,Racer 5,4.25,canned aug2822 poured a semilucid golden straw color with an off white pillowy 2 fingers high head that leaves a fair amount of lacing into a samuel smith imperial pint glass
3112,Racer 5,4.85,overall this is the epitome of a classic west coast style ipa not overly hoppy medium to heavy body and the notes are more floral than bitter doesnt taste like a 7 abv beer and would recommend checking out
3113,Racer 5,4.35,i havent tasted this beer in a long time bear republic didnt distribute in my area for a while great beer if an award was given for balance in an ipa it should be given to racer 5 light clear golden amber color floral piney aroma silky mf piney spicy taste not too hoppy  gee im getting nostalgic for the old days of the west coast ipas with lots of flavor balance
3114,Brown Shugga',4.08,rich with enough bite to be interesting
3115,Brown Shugga',3.58,local beer store had this as a single and i took a chance first of all i couldnt find any dates or date codes anywhere on the bottle  poured cloudy brownish color with a tan head the smell is sweet and almost of a maple syrup the flavor is sweet and has a warmth boozie feel a decent beer if you like sweetness in your beers not my kind of beer but hey it was a one off shot
3116,Brown Shugga',4,pours a hazy amber thick foam malty aroma big flavors bitter hop body followed my syrupy malt sweetness light brown sugar finish you can taste the alcohol complex but well balanced an excellent strong ale
3117,Brown Shugga',3.25,12oz bottle  one of my old favorites this is a big boozy sugary drink with a decent scent and look and dangerous drinkability i used to get sixers of this for 8 back in college and many a blurry night were spent in its embrace
3118,Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.35,amber color with a 2f head in an orval chalice  at first lightly spicy aroma followed by a good fruitiness  tangy spicy mf not overdone  fruity taste accompanied by a lightly spicy finish  excellent beer a chalice is recommended start at about 49 and let the beer warm up for more flavor
3119,Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.4,pours an effervescent head that was gone when i turned back around has a sweet malty nose has a red amber color the flavor is malty sweet with an effervescent mouthfeel light finish with a light bready aftertaste
3120,Trappistes Rochefort 6,3.79,42923 single bottle bought from krogers in morgantown wv  aroma light spice sweet malt pumpernickel bread life a sweet dark brown sugar syrup  highly effervescent bready lingering malt and molasses drying ending leaves a not terribly nice aftertaste cant describe it
3121,Shock Top Belgian White,3,tap hit at a local seafood place they added a dollar to the value by calling it a craft beer lol cold and flat in the chilled mug a wedge of orange attached smells bland but slightly sunny d taste is ok to rinse a shrimp poboy down but ill not get a refill
3122,Shock Top Belgian White,3.15,12oz can  on the pour not even 1 finger of average white head formed then in under a minute it completely dissipates despite that and my clean glass bubbles cling to the side of the glass from excessive carbonation hazy golden orange body  aroma is light for the style with hints of citrus but no coriander a touch metallic with a grainy finish  taste is decent with some nice but subtle orange flavor right in front of an almost sweet wheaty malty body a touch doughy really not bad but not quite a full on belgian wit  feel is highly carbonated and very refreshing much better when poured in a glass than when left in the can at first it seems like its going to be full bodied but the body quickly drops off as a dryness sets in the wheat flavor stacks around for the finish but this gets light fast basically a lawnmower beer  overall this is decent for an ab product but its too expensive for what it is i dont get any coriander and the orange basically replaces any hop character not bad to change up the pace from lagers but not something to give a shot if youn are looking for a quality belgian style wit
3123,Shock Top Belgian White,5,lots of snobs giving shock top a low rating came to even the scale a bit its a great refreshing summer beer with citrus of all the beers to hate on i dont understand why it would be shock top get yourself a six pack next time youre at the beach or grilling in the back yard
3124,Shock Top Belgian White,1.42,how in samhain is this still being made tastes like someone poured a cup of sugar in a blue moon purely putrid cheers
3125,The Legendary Duff Beer,2.06,nov 2010 330 ml bottle brewed by eschweger abv in norway is 47 bought at meny stadionparken crystal clear extremely pale yellow colour big white head grainy aroma of unhopped pilsener wort and boiled vegetables not good sweet and sugary flavour hardly any bitterness what a stupid idea  brewing a purposely shitty american standard pale lager in europe just because homer simpson would have liked it  taste is nothing marketing is everything
3126,The Legendary Duff Beer,2.85,brewed in germany so must adhere to the purity law one would imagine  i thought this stuff would be terrible as it is obviously a gimmick however i was pleasantly surpisred the beer is okay with half decent flavour nothing to write home about though  the packaging states that the beer is a lagerbier hell which would suggest it is a munich helles style beer
3127,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.94,appearance clear light gold lively carbonation and fine 1 head that retains and actually laces for a while until retreating to a thin ring of foam  aroma sweet white wine and corn syrup moderate alcohol smell  flavor sweet white wine and corn syrup alcoholic in the way that nyquil is sweet oily finish  mouthfeel lightmedium high co2 and rather smooth and not hot for the abv  overall not bad for what it is
3128,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,1.97,710ml can tried at a tasting  cooked vegetable grape syrupy sweetness  d  avoid
3129,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,3,40oz bottle from the local get rid of your dts shop i walked past multiple shaking people looking for the cheapest malt liquor money can buy i was also factoring in the alcoholtoprice ratio but alas it wasnt needed the cheapest beer also had the most alcohol a foil labeled 40 called side pocket high gravity  getting back i notice its from wisconsin so my expectations are raised slightly those sconnies know their beer i didnt pour it into a glass because im not a heathen was expecting to have to chase swigs of it with bites of leftover pizza but the taste actually isnt that bad its overly sweet and corny but i was expecting that no hint of alcohol except in the mouthfeel and in the burps and i actually taste hops  buy this beer make you drunk
3130,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.49,poured from a clear 40 oz bottle has a golden color with a 12 inch head smell is of very light malts not a lot there taste is alcohol malts hints of green apples and tobacco feels light in the mouth and overall not the worst malt liquor i have ever had but pretty damn lousy
3131,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.57,very typical clear gold with minimal head and no retention or lacing rousing carbonation that settled after a bit  the usual high gravity lager smellscorn and metallic  taste was more of the samesweet alcoholic and fairly smooth best when cold  mouthfeel was a step above water  just another cheap beer for a hot summer eveningi bought it out of sheer curiosity and because i really needed a quick buzz after a rough day
3132,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.85,40 oz bottle poured into juice glass no brown paper bag present  looks like carbonated urine  it tastes and smells remarkably similar to a very cheap white wine theres not a lot of bitterness its all just corn and alcohol  plenty of alcohol in the aftertaste smooth enough though  hello friend would you like to get very drunk drink this
3133,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,1.79,40 oz bottle 1000th review  straight form the bottle though i poured most of it for someone else it pours a deep gold with a fluffy white head that dissipates moderately quickly  smells like corny mead lots of honey and alcohol and caorn in the scent  the flavor is pretty shitty on the front end it isnt bad mild grain and hops but on the back end it is adjuncty and sickly sweet  the mouthfeel is prickly at first then seems watery  this is just a malt liquor contract brewed by a nearly anonymous and small marketing agency who knows it might share recipes with other or just have a minor tweak it is run of the mill
3134,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,3.2,40oz bottle in a paper bag generally contributed by joshuaseresse this is the last of the malt liquors left over from the malt liquor tasting earlier this summer served in a cantillon glass  hows that for cognitive dissonance  a  a finger of white foam settles to a thick collar but no lace there are streams of tiny bubbles rising throughout the dark urinecolored body  s  grape juice fructose caramel grain light fusel alcohol when it warms up but not too bad for the style  t  sugar corn white grape juice cereal grains alcohol is surprisingly wellhidden although this verges on cloying sweet after a few ounces  m  lower carbonation mediumbodied some grain to the texture and moderate alcohol warmth in the finish  d  this is actually pretty solid and one of the better takes on the style that ive had this one is a little bit too sweet for me to tackle the whole 40oz bottle not quite as good as stack as this one is lower in alcohol but doesnt taste any better
3135,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.28,appearance pours a clearish goldentoned body with a frothy shortlived white head  smell sweetscented chemically aroma of cooked corn boiled apple cores and melted sugars  taste starts off sweet with tastes of substandard grains and sugardosed corn meal hint of fruitiness somewhat reminiscent of apples as with so many okay almost all of these malt liquors it has that troubling potentiallyflammable chemical taste to it finishes nearhot sweet and chemical coated  mouthfeel lightbodied medium carbonation  drinkability ugh about as bad as any other malt liquor so if nothing else these things are fairly consistent the name does at least suit the beverage
3136,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,1.51,the can identified the beer as an ale of the high gravity variety i am unsure about its veracity but what can i do onward  i briefly got a finger of bonewhite head before it dissipated into nothingness color was a deep goldenamber with nequality clarity nose was ungodly sweet underlain by a sharp alcohol quality i remain suspect about this being an ale mouthfeel was medium with a very sugary taste on the tongue and suddenly it hit me  this tasted like colt 45 an american malt liquor which is a lagerstyle whos zoomin who here i am going to leave it simply because the can read ale and i am in no position to argue the finish had a unpleasant tobacco taste like i was sniffing around an ashtray ooof the really bad part is that it came in a 24ounce can and i hated to do a drain pour i didnt with chelada a recent f and i chose to bravely press on awful
3137,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.21,gold hue not much of a head some lace aroma is dank resin and hops taste is bold  50 wheat malt 50 washington state variety hops floral not fruity with a slight bite followed by a dry finish a good one
3138,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.15,mostly clear slightly hazy copper white head good retention and lacing  mango orange grapefruit pine  candied mango papaya grapefruit orange zest brown sugar and pine
3139,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.85,possibly my very favorite beer of all i love everything about it the refreshing taste the smooth feel the golden look cheers
3140,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.5,great beer im not a huge fan of wheat beers in general but this is a fantastic example of what is possible when using wheat it somehow beats out the standard lagunitas ipa for taste
3141,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.98,i guess the first question would be  how to classify it maybe its the sumptin kicking in but it may be lagunitass answer to the pilsner being the classic summertime ale  although it also pairs well with the evening campfire easy going down nice drinkability  third bottle tastes as good as the first doesnt get boring bought a 12pack ca local to take camping  not sure if its being produced in another states facility id buy it again for summertime outings nice malt flavor as well
3142,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.06,pours a clear copper color with a thin off white head swells sweet and floral not overly fruity taste is balanced with a dry bitterness clean finish with a bit of a chalky feel
3143,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.91,pours a clear rich gold light head formation and spotty lacing nose is resinous dank and spicy up front with a secondary note of juicer citrus primarily grapefruit some light tropical notes dried mango and bazooka very wellbalanced taste isnt nearly as bitter or resinous as expected instead this plays on the sweet side with a candied citrus feel up front as well as notes of roasted barley and spice early midpalate theres some mildly bitter hop but not too much mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth without coming across as heavy and preserves some prickly carbonation as well wish this was more bitter but thats just me otherwise a very good affordable and available beer
3144,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.39,bought this the first time on reputation of brewery and was not disappointed  just a very easy to drink brew theres a lot going on with this but it all works well heck i even bought another six pack
3145,Blanc De Blancs,4.7,batch 2  clear golden colour with no head  the smell is mouthwatering with a nice tartness some fruity funky notes but quite clean some wood some vinous notes   the taste follows with a very sour profile white stone fruits from the chardonnay the oak is present but compliments well the whole thing quite balanced it gets better as it warms up  the mouthfeel is dry but not astringent fine natural carbonation  overall its a pleasure to drink such a nice brew which was waiting in my basement for some years now not in style if we speak of bi√®re de champagne but a wonderful wild ale with grape
3146,Blanc De Blancs,4.25,tasted from bottle pours a hazy yellow with slight white head that quickly fades lots of wine grape notes with some apples and a little pear tart and sour but overly so excellent sipper well done
3147,Blanc De Blancs,4.9,121 yum
3148,Blanc De Blancs,4.43,look  very slight haze bright and golden smell  funky tart lemon grape farmhouse taste  funky tart lemon grape farmhouse like the smell but also has a great woody slight champagne feel  medium body with a champagne carb and dry overall  fantastic
3149,Blanc De Blancs,3.98,very clear light gold body lively carbonation no head nice farmhouse smells barnyard funk fresh cut hay some lemon and other citrus notes very pleasant flavors sweet white wine green apple lemon raspberry and peach tart moderately heavy body smooth and rather flat very acidic overall with a touch of underlying sweetness for depth  i heard good things about this beer and paid a pretty price for it 65 actually ordered it by mistake but so it goes overall this is a decent beer for the style but not something i think warrants the price paid for it  pouring temperature 49 f bottling data vintage 2020
3150,Blanc De Blancs,4.31,2020 vintage  a huge shoutout to merpunk1 for hooking me up with this one in a trade its the highest rated bi√®re de champagne and 245 overall so its only fitting to drink this baby on new years eve the rest of the daynight will consist of old classics but its nice to open something fancy for my last review of 2021 lets get into it  pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing eventually fades to absolutely nothing but its still a decent looking beer  man im really digging the nose on this one funky and delicate at the same time im picking up on aromas of white grape white wine vinegar tangerine sharp oak and earthy apple  its straight up explosive in taste in your face and complex while being downright drinkable on the front end of the sip im tasting tart green apple sour white grape wet hay sharp oak lemon zest and crackery malt the swallow brings notes of earthy white white old leather tart white grape apple skin sharp oak floral honey and lemon zest  a light medium body pairs with fine carbonation resulting in a tart and crisp beer finishes mostly dry with just a touch of residual sweetness  this is great stuff and a great kickoff to nye its been a hell of a 2021 both on here and in my life and general so cheers ba happy new year
3151,Blanc De Blancs,4.3,a 375ml bottle blend 2 poured into a 3 fonteinen stemmed glass  appearance a clear golden colour with a half finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly to a ring around the glass while leaving only sparse lacing  aroma sweet lightly tart vinous white grape oak honey with light funky notes  taste sour tart vinous white wine grapes honey oak funk with notes of sharp acidity but not overly so  mouthfeel medium bodied with moderate to soft carbonation  overall solid beer with nice aromas and flavours with abv completely hidden
3152,Blanc De Blancs,4.49,i received a bottle from fbarber in the nbs bif 14 poured into a side project lambic glass also courtesy of fbarber it pours a cloudy bright orange it looks like orangina the head fizzled away almost immediately but that is typical for the style the nose is just superb like a fine chardonnay im smelling lemon orange peel and peach its taste is sublime funky oaky white wine grape with soft notes of peach that sweeten the brettanomyces and native missouri microflora its so delicate and fine it has the expected effervescence and it doesnt drink like 10 abv overall blanc de blancs is an absolute delight im privileged to have had the chance to try it
3153,Milk Stout,3.83,i had this beer poured from draft into a shaker pint flat dark brown color with good head and lacing smell and taste of milk chocolate smokey earthy and very easy to drink nice feel for the style  actually surprised i had not reviewed before
3154,Milk Stout,3.86,12oz bottle pours a very deep brownblack color with a small cap of dark tancolored head that recede to a thick ring around the edge of the glass while leaving a small amount of lacing smells of dark roasted malts and rich chocolate taste is very rich on roasted and charred malt notes dark chocolate milk chocolate and coffee with a hint of caramel toffee and dark fruits the flavor is very robust and deep with a noticeable but by no means overpowering sweetness and a slightly astringent burnt bitterness to close fullbodied with a very luxurious smooth almost syrupy mouthfeel and subtle carbonation  this was a very tasty and wellbalanced milk stout definitely not overly bitter like many american stouts nor overwhelmingly sweet like many milk stouts have had this beer before and will certainly buy again
3155,Milk Stout,4.01,pours into my guinness glass quite dark brownblack with a thin ring not really a head  i cant smell anything bad air these days  tastes sweet almost like cola but nicely darkbeer roasty the alcohol isnt very noticeable malty no bitterness for me  feels thin and light lightly carbonated  overall pretty good better as it warms
3156,Milk Stout,4.11,440ml can  pours black with a 15 finger cream head with decent retention onthe nose its fairly sweet with a touch of coffee up front it tastes of roasted malted barley and coffee followed by a hint of dark chocolate with a very subtle bitterness and vanilla overall its very sweet and enjoyable
3157,Milk Stout,4.04,pouring straight into a snifter  minimal head appearing aromas of sweet milk chocolate coffee molasses and malts definitely tastes as advertised but isnt as sweet as one expects getting maltsmolasses upfront followed by coffee and a nice roasty coffee ending feel is so smooth due to the nitrogen easy to sip cant taste that 6 at all in this i tried this in the beginning stages of trying stouts but can decipher it a lot better and have to say this is still a good treat to have try this if your beginning to try stouts and youll love it
3158,Milk Stout,4.15,404ml can served cold into a pint glass lcbo purchase for around 4 cdn  appearance  dark brown color close to a finger of dense fluffy tan head great staying power  smell  lots of dark chocolate a hint of raisins and some coffee backing everything up good intensity  taste  semi sweet chocolate with some coffee in the aftertaste i get glosette raisins mid sip pretty delicious stuff mildly bitter with nice sweet centre  mouthfeel  medium full bodied and very creamy  overall  an excellent milk stout one of the very best that is widely available glad to have finally tried now that a batch has come to ontario
3159,Milk Stout,4.09,poured from a 12oz bottle best by 02052023  on the pour one finger of fine tan head formed then recedes to a decent covering and ring that leaves nice lacing but continues dissipating body is a solid black even up to light i wish there was a bit more head though  aroma is dark and smooth like a better sweeter and ever so slightly fruitier guiness dark chocolate with a hint of roast verging on coffee with some sweet malty notes make up this one slight hops are present but they blend in nicely and are mostly bittering  taste follows the aroma with even more roasty almost bitter malts that are quickly balanced by a molasses dark chocolate sweetness the roast comes out even more in the finish with true and smooth roasty barley making up the aftertaste retaining some sweetness  feel is laid back smooth and easy drinking but still has that cozy vibe that a good stout should bring not too thick or syrupy but still quite full quite attenuated despite the sweetness and is almost dry bit not quite with a slight mouthcoating maltiness  overall this was exactly what i was looking for for a slightly chilly early fall night after drinking too many lagers a nice dark ale was in order but i didnt want too many hops or to go too heavy this is close to refreshing but has a laid back armchair vibe to it as well versatile refreshing and roasty
3160,Milk Stout,4.58,look it may just be me but i think stouts are always the best looking beers so its always gonna be a 5  smell chocolate coffee smells like one of those starbucks nitro shot things  taste like a mocha coffee sweet this is one of the best tasting beers but he warned its very sweet  feel lingers a bit too long imo but still very nice  overall this is a damn good stout im so glad my local liquor store has this highly recommend
3161,Milk Stout,3.75,i went to college in boulder and i dont understand why this is so popular but its cool became the standard for normal milk stout
3162,Milk Stout,4.07,i poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass a one inch head melted into a thin sheet within minutes but still provided moderate lacing the aroma is quite pleasant chocolate roasted barley coffee milk and a vanillalike sweetness prevail the resultant effect bears a faint barrelaged resemblance the taste is about what you expect from the nose the roasted barley blends well with moderate hops and the milk sweetens the chocolatey stout i expected a stickier consistency but the mouthfeel is nicely balanced the taste and feel is quite clean and refreshing compared to a typical stout i find left hand milk stout a compelling choice among dark sweet stouts on the market and the 6 abv is right on target for what i desired from this brew
3163,St. Pauli N. A.,2.39,12 oz bottle poured straight from the fridge into a nonic  pours a medium gold with a 15 finger staying white head leaving a good film of lacing  initial aroma is very much skunk and marijuana even upon opening the bottle other than that all i can really say is it smells like a lager years and crisp  taste is very much sweet malt with some bitterness and not much else the sweetness is surprisingly very high being slightly fruity but very much a caramel malt flavor tasting light in color the aftertaste comprises strongly bitter hops and the afformentioned sweetness both present on the back of the top of the tongue  mouthfeel is thin and watery but also crisp and slightly fluffy honestly not bad despite the drawbacks  overall not terrible but nothing to write home about its a macro  not going to buy again but worth it to try once
3164,St. Pauli N. A.,2.84,appearance  pours clear and light yellow with a white half finger width head not much for lacing  smell  light skunk malty sweetness and faint whiffs of grain and grass  taste  follows the nose cereal malt sweetness slight grain and a touch of grassy hops sweetness dominates the aftertaste  mouthfeel  light in body with moderate bitey carbonation slick drinker with a crisp finish  overall  its okay for what it is but the sweetness makes it hard to drink more than a few of these before moving onto something else
3165,St. Pauli N. A.,3.07,st pauli na pours clear golden with a twofinger snowwhite head that left great lacing nose is malty taste is sweet malt with slight bitterness mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated and watery overall good
3166,St. Pauli N. A.,2.88,extremely low expectations for this one pours a fizzy foamy 1 finger head with good retention a bit of lacing crystal clear light pale watery color  nose light cereal grain and mild skunk dank skunky note malt water a little herbal hop maybe not as bad as expected other than skunk  taste brings more stale cereal grain water and skunky straw mild skunk dank like and skunk is only mild touch of bitterness and herbal hop dry finish with med bitterness and a hint astringent  mouth is lighter bod med carb  overall not a great beer but not as bad as i expected a bit like malt water but somewhat typical for na beers only mild skunky note which when i had the original it was crazy skunk thanks to the green bottle
3167,St. Pauli N. A.,3.8,12 oz green bottle freshest before 022022 purchased single off shelf at roger wilco pennsauken poured into a 14 oz mug  l brilliantlyclear pale gold liquid foam forms on the pour but breaks up in chunklets no lace  s somehow a little skunky wet coins andor vinyl siding wet forest hint of doughy biscuity malt  t all of those aromas are pretty much exactly what i get on the palate with the malt of course opening up taking over the flavors bit of back end grassy bitterness and perhaps a hint of toasty smoke that helps establish a little balance and depth  f mediumbodied a bit sluggish flowing through but ends with a nice tickle of carbonation giving way to the soft stunning hum of hop bitterness about standard for its ilk  o overall not too bad base flavors are about standard the bit of bitterness there certainly provides a touch of interest i could do this one on the regular if need be 1912
3168,St. Pauli N. A.,2.87,this one pours a crystal clear golden color thinner one finger velvety white head average retention aroma is skunky sweet grain slight honey and some grassy hops  taste follows the nose with strong notes of sweet malty grains dried hay grassy hops it is quite skunked which should not be surprising since it is in a green bottlestill its skunked enough that it is actively distracting feel is light crisp moderate carbonation  overall this one is ok it is too skunked to really enjoy but seems to do a solid job capturing the essence of the regular version
3169,St. Pauli N. A.,1.86,12oz bottle  review from notes  this is a good beer but a terrible na beer i dont know what they lost in translation but this tastes like funky water there are much better na options these days  this needs alcohol to be worth drinking
3170,St. Pauli N. A.,3.56,goes down smooth with just a light tinge of noble hop variety vegetal aftertaste some grass and a slight bitterness cereal grain malts overall this is what one would expect of the style and i would drink it again
3171,Budweiser Select,4.05,shaker pint in the biergarten at the st louis brewery  decent for a light lager cant tell its low carb or any different than their other light lagers it seems to have that slightly doughy flavor that i find present in busch never seen this in my market and why would i slight dried flower grain grassy scent certainly not dull for what it is 2167
3172,Budweiser Select,5,its not perfect but for a light beer at 43abv it is not bad rated it a 5 because budweiser select in my opinion is the best light beer available and it should not be rated awful
3173,Budweiser Select,1.98,i guess its beer
3174,Budweiser Select,3.06,poured from a 12oz can best by september 9th 2023  on the pour a finger of sudsy verging on fizzy head formed with surprisingly decent retention head settles at a fine but thin covering body is highly carbonated and a clear golden yellow  aroma is very close to bisch light but perhaps slightly more substantial theres definitely corn in this beer cheap macro smell but not the worst  taste follows the aroma slightly fuller busch light decent doughy grainy thing and it doesnt taste too watered down  feel is surprisingly full drinkable and refreshing but not heavy this is actually a smooth macro lager  overall this was impressive in my opinion better than bud heavy and maybe even mhl
3175,Budweiser Select,2,had that one time at a party back in the day i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included
3176,Budweiser Select,3,of all the low calorie low carb beers ill take this over to others
3177,Budweiser Select,1.7,pours a very pale yellow color with a very small white head it has the taste of a beer  sort of  when you drink one ice cold and are dying of thirst havent had one in years and now i remember why blah
3178,Budweiser Select,3.5,this is my favorite backyard allnighter beer in my fridge you find 3 types of beer a stout buyoftheweek miller lite budweiser select love budweiser select cant complain full of memories of the good ole college years where we all chip in to buy a 24pk or two
3179,Budweiser Select,4.27,one of the better light macro beers out there  itll never compare to the craft beer but its excellent for what it is great lawn mowing  fishing  golfing beer on a hot day
3180,Very HHHazyyy,4.6,l  opaque hazy orangeyellow with a thin creamy white head that dissipates quickly leaving behind a good amount of lacing s  orange mango passion fruit peaches piney resinous hops t  follows the nose  tons of orange and peach upfront with a little bit of passion fruit and mango intermixed well with resinous piney hops f  full bodied with light carbonation smooth soft fluffy o  a fantastic neipa  one of the benchmarks for the style  a little more nuance to the flavor profile compared to emperor julius
3181,Very HHHazyyy,4.59,on tap at the tewksbury location sublimely smooth white packing an absolute ton of dank yummy citrus and fruit ive really run out of superlatives for th sauce these days yum
3182,Very HHHazyyy,4.53,look  nice thick honey orange with a thick frothy white head and sticky smell  orange peach but not as much as i was expecting taste  nice blend between orange ripe peach mango in that order with a very slight bite feel  medium body creamy with a slight carb nice mouth coating sticks to it all overall  really a fantastic beer wish the smell was more but all and all fantastic
3183,Very HHHazyyy,4.67,what th says on the can i 100 agree very hqzy is one of my top rated beers from th and in my taste bud opinion this is better i lucked out on 518 when i was at the tree and this was available yay oyay great beer and i hope its available on one of my few trips to th
3184,Very HHHazyyy,4.64,if you like prototypical hazy ipas this is the one super soft on the pallette ripe stone fruits and pineapple abound something like an umbrella drink truly a sensational beer that somehow stands apart from the rest
3185,Flipside Red IPA,3.86,poured a 12oz bottle into an ipa glass clear dark amber color with a lot of tiny carbonation bubbles popping up off white head is thick and lasts forever a lot of lacing left behind in the glass smell is sweet brown bread citrus fruits and pine taste follows with a bit of sweet malt up front some caramel then pine and citrus kick in bitterness is minimal finish leaves behind a hit of pine feel is medium bodied soft carbonation overall a solid hoppy red ale easy drinker tasty solid
3186,Flipside Red IPA,4.15,look  deep amberred solid off white head good lacing rings smell  bready piney tangerine taste  bready piney pine resin tangerine peppery spice chocolate feel  medium body moderate carbonation pine resin bitter finish overall  3 flipsides in the fan favorites pack the first one was good and by the third it was hitting on all cylinders bready malt and tangerine up front really good pine resin and spicy finish that lingers with hints of pepper and chocolate solid brew that pairs well with wheels of fire by manowar

3188,Flipside Red IPA,4.31,so excited to try this again havent had it since 2014 or 2015 when it was still a seasonal  clear dark red in color basically chestnut capped with a nice creamy off white head excellent retention and lacing  smells like rye peppery spicy sweet burnt sugar pine conessap  taste smacks hard of pumpernickel bread burnt sugar molasses red velvet cakebut rather than go cloying the sweetness gets cut with pine sap pine needles black pepper fennel red grapefruit peel nice bitterness and spice cuts through that sweetness rich and malty nice body chuggable creamy carbonation nice piney bitterness but doesnt overwhelm scrubs the palate clean save for a lingering slickness  damn this a damn fine beer i remember why this impressed me so much malt for days but no cloy clean bitterness and impact endless drinkability sierra nevada please bring this back
3189,Flipside Red IPA,4.38,light chestnut brown with hints of red when backlit head is light light brown great retention and well above average lacing mostly clear  something dark fruit like pungent caramelize citrus character toasty and bark like light sweet sappiness  taste is a really neat mix of all sorts of hop and malt the hops are gently fruity like but quickly become biting with bitter citrus rind and light pine the malt lends a nice touch of toast and some caramelization  clean and easy drinking noticeable lingering bitterness smoothly carbed with a dry finish that really pairs nice with the bitter hops give so nice stickiness to this beer  this is a really awesome well balanced yet nicely malty ipa thanks again for doing this sierra nevada
3190,Flipside Red IPA,3.63,clear mahogany nice off white head great retention rings of lace grapefruit generic tropical pine and floral hop aromas rich malt underneath toasted brown bread caramel some grapefruit and tropical fruit malt flavors medium bodied and appropriately carbonated didnt check the date when i bought the mixed pack so three months old and the hops have definitely dropped off but was probably dope when fresh
3191,Flipside Red IPA,4.18,71723 grabbed a single last week 225 never heard of this and wasnt aware at the time was part of an mixed fan favorites pack  liked it alot logged on to review only to find my long forgotten review from 2013  this is not that review looks good smells good tastes good premium red ale in a bottle yes i drink canned beer now all the rage and you know what theyre all whats wrong with craft these days  yes huge drinks yes overly sugarized every 192 oz can the pathetic state of craft these days but this was good enough to go get another single today and yes would buy more if available not the mixed 12 pak the ruthless rye i also tried was ok i am an old hop rod rye lover bear republic bring it back x5k out  original 2013 well lately ive made a point to only review beers i like this is not that review if they let me i could do this review in one word  mediocre or boring weak uninspired average you choose or my choice why color is uninspiring red smells and tastes slightly bitter hops not very drinkable and rather poor mouthfeel the good is that i only paid 149 and i only got one waste of time
3192,Flipside Red IPA,3.75,look is more brown than red and quite murky not impressive looking by any stretch  smell is very void of much anything bottle is exactly 3 months old dossappinting here too  taste is pretty lackluster almost like an arrogsnt bastard ale with only 14 of the bitterness  feel is sorta oily  overall i would not but this beer again it came in a mix 12 pack so i have 2 more of them but would much rather them have been one of the other varieties or simply just a snpa instead
3193,Flipside Red IPA,4.55,this is like a better version of arrogant bastard ale to me its a thicker more syrupy red ale it is very well balanced of high dose of malt with hops to balance it out flavor is spot on the alcohol however is not well hidden i thought this might be 8 alcohol and was surprised to see it is only 62 it has a strong after taste of alcohol going down i dont mind it though i wonder though if the label is correct caramel flavor is there darker caramel
3194,Saison-Brett,3.77,750 ml bottle vintage 2013 probably from vinmonopolet abv is 85 pale golden colour only slightly hazy huge and lasting white head lovely aroma of saison yeast and brett with fruity and peppery notes hints of farmhouse medium sweet but still quite crisp flavour with peppery notes distinct bittering hops
3195,Saison-Brett,4.01,an acidic but fruitful saison has a very relaxed aftertaste that is warm and fresh the energy aroma is better than its taste but still an excellent beer
3196,Saison-Brett,4.31,appearance pours a hazy yelloworange thick fluffy head great retention inviting indeed would love it if the head was not just plain white lacing is quite good nothing crazy though smell hop backbone citrusy namely orange and grapefruit notes of brett and pepper taste balanced the citrusy hops mingle well with the brett notes hop bitterness is low brett peppery and citrusy hops are at the top the finish has a nice malty tinge and tastes of alcohol as it gets warmer the pepper notes really come through like tank 7 mouthfeel effervescent burn light bodied soft crisp refreshing smooth enough dry it touches the lips and tongue with a gentle caress overall first offits not tank 7and thats to be expected its a lovely beast of its own and its well invited i have another already to drink down the road in a few yearsbut i may get another for my birthday next year so good
3197,Saison-Brett,3.89,had a 2011 bottle back in september 2015 bottle  12235  pours a darker golden color hints of mild cloudiness and with a big ol full on head exceeding 1 aroma imparted notes of grain alcohol hay rawhide pepper and bitter melon  taste allayed my fears about this being too big and an imperial saison 85 is too big normally but somehow this kept its style guideline roots mouth feel stayed relatively dry and light instead of dropping an oppressive amount of alcohol more lemon tartness in the taste than aroma a little bit of other citrus beyond that a pear note and a pineapple note minimal band aid phenol funk notes even though it was 4 years old it didnt seem much different than fresher pours ive had of it  at the end of the day its a very good beer but the price point around 20 is such that i dunno how often i can buy a bottle of it a pour on tap sure knock it out every time but a bottle that is sometimes tough because you can get other ones for half the price
3198,Saison-Brett,4.38,2018 on tap into tulip  original rating from notes pulled from interdimensional memorial travel through millions of miles of space and time away 425 across the board  oh lawd this takes me back wish i could get this in a 2008  slight amber haze with onefinger tight ivory sticky foam head  upfront barnyard funk sweet n sour lemon citrus slight caramel and multigrain bread coming through fresh scythed meadow outside of stull ks lovely  not the same as i remembered but pretty close great big funky citrus lemon peel and orange pith brett comes swinging through with the protofunk like herbie hancock on a headhunt pisssoaked horse blanket that i chewed on in a dream splendid  a bit tame on draft compared to the errant eruption of yesteryear still fizzy and bubbly champagney slight drying with a balanced malt sweetness  an og in my book just a young buck but man was this a trip when i first had it several times since and i stick with my ratings you know what bump that taste and feel up a notch worth a shot
3199,Saison-Brett,4.37,boulevard saison brett 2016 85 abv pours hazy bright orange with a foamy white 5 finger head that left heavy lacing nose is grassy malty pepper leather belt not shoe with slight funk taste has lemon zest a mashup of other fruits pepper dry and slightly bitter there is a lot more going on with taste than i can describe outstanding mouthfeel heavier carbonation but not unpleasant overall worldclass
3200,Saison-Brett,4.49,2016 vintage  pours slightly hazy amber gold with a lasting foam head the smells are slightly malty saisony and earthy funky filled with brettanomyces notes of caramel honeydew melon green banana sweet clove spice peppercorn funky leather earthy brett notes rubber tire dried fruit with floral earthy hops tastes pretty nice clean honeydew melon green banana plantain notes tart lemon mild apple peppercorn clove spice some funky earthy brett notes like sweet leather rubber tire dried fruit apricot caramel vanilla bready malts with floral herbal hops feels medium lighter bodied creamy smooth with moderate carbonation overall a nice aged brett saison
3201,Saison-Brett,4.21,2017 vintage poured into a nonic cloudy amber massive bubbly head that sticks around to the end lots of sticky lacing awesome nose fruity aroma with some mild barnyard a very nice start fruity up front changing to clean barnyard with a long peppery finish light body overall an outstanding saison
3202,O.W.K.,4.65,b2 served at sp from bottle waited for it to warm for awhile pitch black nice balance of bourbon and vanilla on the nose complex beer starts off with bourbon forward then vanilla comes in very subtlety and finishes with delicious chocolate medium to heavy mouthfeel wouldve liked it heavier some vanilla is there but subtle showcasing the barrel i wouldve liked more vanilla however
3203,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.09,2017 vintage enjoyed on 05142022
3204,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.25,2018 vintage consumed on 11122  pours a clear jetcrimson body with sharp bloodred highlights and topped with a finger and a half of creamy pale beige foam subpar head retention fades to a few spotty paperthin islands of cap a large frothy collar and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass  aromas of harsh ripe whiskey breed burnt sugar smoked butterscotch and caramel and a decadent pruneplum compote shreds of whiskey umami and soy varnish make way for floral oak barrel carrying vanilla icing against potent bourbon lingering as a final impressor  taste shows burnt sugar and toffee swirled into fig syrup upfront with plummy esters lingering through the midpalate to a bourbon back end leaving a dusting of cocoa to finish  mouthfeel offers a medium body with minimal carbonation and a semioily viscosity maintaining a slickness into the midpalate a char is intertwined in a mild tannic twang with incredible subtlety on the back end of the palate where a piercing encompassing warmth peaks into the finish  cresting at the potent richness of boozy barrel peaks ascendant dark fruit jams near umami status against an unrelenting spirit and fresh oak barrel interplay structure and detail at the highest levels of barleywine
3205,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.71,for purposes of this review the 2014 vintage was sampled  appearance  the beer poured a rusty red color with a few white bubbles crowning the top of the glass  smell  the nose was a sweet bready barleywine with hints of bourbon this pretty much nailed the expectation  taste  the profile had the appropriate level of sweetness there were notes of raisin tobacco orange rind big caramel and a nice mild alcohol burn at the finish  mouthfeel  the feel was smooth almost slick with carbonation largely faded  overall  this is fairly old school but it is still elite
3206,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.63,vintage 2018  quite low carb which really accentuates the rich oily body of the beer there is a ton of thick caramel to the beer  sweet but nicely balanced by malt and hops smooth zero trace of the abv with a surprisingly clean finish the nose isnt powerful but very accurately communicates the rich toffee and caramel of the beer  sofa king good highly recommended
3207,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.5,drinks smooth wo strong fusel presence but warms the insides and clearly swings above 145  absolutely still a slightly translucent dirty amber no head leaves transparent sheeting on the glass  smells of oxidationsweet toffee sherry the library attic light unsweetened peanut and faint marshmallowand a curious crab appleorchard rot undertone  taste follows nose sherry brandy orange liquor old books faint peanut and marshmallow and drying crabapple on the finish drinks like 18 but in a wonderful wayso close to a fine spirit yet just far enough away to remain drinkable and assert itself as a beer  kuhnhenn bros strike again
3208,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.52,pours an amazing ruby red with a head that dissipates immediately smells is super spicy i would guess this was aged in a rye barrel if it didnt specifically say bourbon its a sipper 145 drinks like 80 proof its a monster and a masterpiece
3209,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.24,winter solstice 2018 drank in winter spring 20182019 forgot to write details
3210,Zombie Dust,4.88,yeah man the reviews and the hype are spot on here my friend who only drinks busch light had 2 cans in his fridge and i about had a dang heart attack this beer isnt available in may area but his friend from out of town had left them and he let me try them holy cow i was blown away that a pale ale could be so complex honestly it was almost perfect in every way not too hoppy or malty great mouthfeel and perfectly balanced flavor with some fruit notes up front trust me when i say its one of the best beers out there period
3211,Zombie Dust,4.1,poured into a grip shaped goblet color is slightly hazed gold head presents 1 finger thick dissipates to solid top with some lacing  smell is crisp citric and earth hops pale malt light toast  taste is hop forward  notes of citrus earth light pine pale malt and lighter caramel and toast some herbal qualities emerge with warmth  mouthfeel is moderate carbonation moderate sweetness moderate bitterness  overall a very good apa  it does seem slightly aged so would like to try again closer to canning date but even still would expect a bit more malt out of an apa this highly rated
3212,Zombie Dust,3.23,this is an old school west coast ipa not bad just out of fashion with new hszy craze this one delivers the malt and hops 10 years ago my revies may have been more favorable
3213,Zombie Dust,4.39,a very good beer if you were an ipa fan i had it on draft in leesburg virginia and its from indiana this would compete with any west coast beer
3214,Zombie Dust,4.09,12 oz can from total wine in short pump va the ale poured a hazy amber with a white foamy head and lacing the aroma of citrus mostly grapefruit and orange the flavors are mostly grapefruit and pale malts the ale has a medium body and average carbonation this is a topnotch pale ale
3215,Zombie Dust,4.5,the hops are assertive even bitter in the aftertaste but not painful a slight sweetness and juicy fruitiness on the nose and at first sip before the hops crash in great combination of lateboil aroma hops and earlyboil bittering hops the flavor is dynamic not static as you sip this is a beer for someone who likes bitter 3 floyds is one of the benefits to living in the midwest right after the cost of living and the sweetcorn
3216,Zombie Dust,4.48,solid pale ale it is a bit light on the tongue but other than that really nice and truly well balanced
3217,Zombie Dust,5,one of my top picks for a great ipa my biggest hate is its not available where i live
3218,Zombie Dust,4.02,12oz brown bottle  three floyds zombie dust has a clear goldamber colored body and atop sat a 1 ¬Ωfinger white foamy head the head had good retention and left behind nice lacing the nose was dominated by citrus grapefruit orange and lemon were noted the taste follows the nose but is fuller and light malt is also evident the finish is bitter and dry mouth feel is medium bodied that is crisp and dry with a bitter finish  zombie dust is a wellmade american pale ale that is a little too hoppy for this non hophead
3219,Two Hearted IPA,4.27,not too hoppy just as good room temperature as ice cold better from bottle wife doesnt like it so its my goto beer when camping reasonably priced in my area
3220,Two Hearted IPA,3.9,12oz can with date code 062823 served in a pint glass bit coppery color orange amber with a thick white head very nice start old school aipa aromas of citrus and maybe some pine really substantial mouthfeel owing to a solid malt backbone with some crystal malts along with a creamy load of carbonation maybe even oats in the mash but anyway this is an ipa and it brings along a very reasonable level of bitterness and piny goodness makes me think of dogfish 60 minute in terms of flavor profile turned up just a little bit but not as far as 90  ive been hearing about this middleofthecountry beer for years and im not disappointed having finally tried it
3221,Two Hearted IPA,3.58,a staple if you will gets better as it warms decent ipa not too much hops

3223,Two Hearted IPA,4.57,wonderful mediumstrength ipa with beautiful and nicely balanced flavors of pine and tropical fruits ideal for winterfall as this beer will warm your souls a bit heavy for warm days can feel like a meal
3224,Two Hearted IPA,4.36,an american pale ale at its most defining characteristic ive grown to love centennial hops and this seems to be available at many stores which as much as i love local craft brews especially around chicago like 3 floyds and revolution distribution is key for a transient graduate student as myself who loves consistent tasty beers at reasonable prices this beer holds its freshness compared to other american ipas which need to be consumed within 68 weeks
3225,Two Hearted IPA,4.5,bells two hearted is a classic ipa that i cant be mad at its the kind of beer that ill happily buy at a bar and not be disappointed the look of the beer is see through the smell is mostly a classic balance of hops and malt the taste and feel is nothing different there are only a few ipas that i like better because they have more west coast hops but this beer is as reliable and classic as it comes
3226,Two Hearted IPA,4.53,pours a rich gold color clear with a foamy white head smells a little of pine bitterness taste is well balanced caramel malt flavor with a dry bitter finish
3227,Two Hearted IPA,5,for many years ive read about how good this beer isbut it wasnt available about 2 weeks ago i found it at a local store in the 22 oz can section and couldnt believe my eyes yesthis beer lives up to all the rave reviews in a world where there are so many great ipasthis one stands out
3228,Two Hearted IPA,4.66,so darn good had to force it down my mamas throat
3229,Two Hearted IPA,4.39,l  golden with a good amount of clarity and a white head that sticks around a bit leaving behind a thin cap and some lacing s  juicy piney floral hops along with bright tropical fruit notes along with citrus some malt t  juicy piney floral hops up front intermixed well with tropical fruit notes  pineapple passion fruit some citrus along with crackery malt f  medium bodied with moderate carbonation juicy o  a very well balanced classic ipa
3230,Kirin Ichiban,3.59,polished brass color with a decent head that fizzily drops to a white sheet leaving little lacing nose is toasty malt sweetness with a crisp mineral whiff and a caramelish malt sweetness thats neither pleasant nor unpleasant but which is most definitely there it is roundfeeling and has a pretty rich malt character all the way through the finish medium carbonation honestly a more complex beer than i was expecting but still a little hollow and onenote in a way industrial lager all is there is something about this can that is making me wonder but what its lightly oxidized but regardless a decent enough beer  3753535375375
3231,Kirin Ichiban,5,a very nice offering in the style smooth and clean it has a crisp finish a fine beer to enjoy with any meal its very refreshing and very crushable i recommend it cheers

3233,Kirin Ichiban,4.66,tastes good bitter hops tastes chewy i am content with this beer forever nice head that lasts great with japanese and korean anju drinking snacks
3234,Kirin Ichiban,3.1,l crystal clear golden body with lively carbonation 2 finger white head that has excellent retention  s pilsner malt saaz hops  t euro lager like nothing special but not bad  f thin and fizzy  o for 999 a 6 pack id drink again not a terrible beer not good either
3235,Kirin Ichiban,2.1,japanese beer brewed in germany interesting is anything about it actually japanese aside from the strange goaty dragon thing on the label cool bottle design i like it  refreshing aroma of dry slightly aromatic hops small bubbles in the head looks pretty good  yes its definitely different from a usual german pilsner the hops are a little more aromatic sophisticated and kind of japanesey its super light and dry a bit like asahi but the hops seem to have more flavour and its kind of sweet this would go perfectly with sushi for sure  its the kind of beer that is refreshing initially but becomes a little boring as you drink more of it its a little too sweet for me and needs some more hops to balance the sweetness but i do like the hops flavour and the light dryness but its nothing special aside from the rather unique goat alien dragon thing
3236,Curiosity Twenty Seven,4.52,2 months old can to wine glass  l pours a full and hazy orangeish yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing some very tiny floaters visible  s sweet and hoppy with notes of candied citrus fruits paired with bubblegummy strawberry notes  t grapefruit orange and lime strawberry and peach as well hoppy and grassy less sweet than its taste with a bitter finish  f full and juicy almost creamy quite sharp medium carbonation  o nice balance of fruity and grassy as well as sweet and bitter notes classic th with a sharp twist great beer
3237,Curiosity Twenty Seven,4.44,canned on 372023 consumed on 422023  poured from the can the color is quite hazy murky and juicy looking no light comes through when held up to the light the head that this beer produces is 2 finger white and frothy looking the head retention is decent and theres a ton of lacing on the glass the aroma is quite dominated by the hops it is juicy smelling i get mango grapefruit and pineapple on the nose the flavor is very juicy and has the flavors i mentioned in the aroma theres a bit of mango up front that fades to the grapefruit and pineapple on the back these latter flavors really linger on my taste buds and in my throat heck i will be burping pineapple and grapefruit for a while the body feels quite full soft feeling and juicy i am fairly burnt out on this style however when its done right i love it this is done right
3238,Matilda,4.21,the pour is golden yellow with some sediment the taste is belgian yeast mild hops along with some sour notes from brettanomyces along with some mild banana pear  green apple notes this was quite an impressive belgian ale cheers a

3240,Matilda,4.12,i love this style it has quite a bit of fruitiness and funk much like a good apple cider fermented with wild yeast it reminds me of summer evenings in the countryside good memories great aroma and flavor
3241,Matilda,4.08,12 oz bottle date code is unclear but i think its best by 13 jan 26  pours golden orange color white head aroma of fruity apricot spicy clove bready malt similar taste a little tart in the finish thin to medium bodied feel is a little slick
3242,Matilda,4.26,big blossoming strong ale with brett illuminating notes and rudycopper body the alcohol is tame on the palate with a protracted sizzle of carbonation and back to forward bloom of malt sweetness a jolly good pale ale hybrid
3243,Matilda,3.79,its been about 5 years since i had this beer at a local event held at the football stadium in a large party room this is not a style i generally pursue but i found this beer to be tasty and the flavor grew on me as i consumed it i didnt take a lot of notes on untappd but i found the bottle to be somewhat spicey and unique
3244,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.63,bottle kindly shared by gunnar abv is 95 pitch black colour creamy brown head intense aroma of chocolate and espresso coffee also liquorice and oak the flavour is oaky and roasty with loads of chocolate without being too sweet also notes of liquorice and espresso coffee well balanced an excellent beer

3247,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.5,still love this beer first had in 2016 from the bottle 475 then in 2017 45 then a 2016 in 2018 375 maybe my palette has changed over the years resulting in the lowered rating or maybe its me aging the beer but its still one of my old favorites that ill continue to buy
3248,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.29,on tap pours a satin black with a multi finger tan head that lingers and leaves lacing nose of espresso and roasted malt taste follows nose with roasted malt strong coffee and a subtle not of chocolate to balance the roastiness full body and low carbonation that is absolutely velvety smooth another great yeti great divide does these magnificently
3249,Keystone Light,2.76,not the best beer but you can get 15 cans for 11
3250,Keystone Light,2.46,poured from a 12 oz can into a 12 oz glass typical strawgolden with streaming bubbles nice head of foam and lacing no aroma that i could detect however the beer was not skunked in any waythe taste was somewhat nondescript but once again let you know you were drinking beer the mouthfeel was a bit watery and light overall not bad on a hot summer day and icecold i do believe it is an urban legend that ksl is actually coors light in a different package
3251,Keystone Light,2.5,poured into a pilsner glass straight from the fridge  pours a slightly pale meaning less vibrant not less bright yellow gold with a 1 finger fairly quickly dissipating white head  initial aroma is very yeasty with a little peppery hop smell kind of a light olive green smell its a little musty  after agitating i pick up more more hoppy smell as well as a hint of ammonia maybe  initial taste is seriously like drinking a flavoured seltzer after a noticeable delay this is followed by a very strong as strong as a light beer can be taste of crusty white bread this carries over to the aftertaste where a rather mild bitterness also expresses itself in the back of the roof of the mouth and the back of the sides and top of the tongue  there really isnt anything more i can pick up on unfortunately but i mean im sure its brewed with simplicity in mind  mouthfeel is unsurprisingly very thin and as previously stated its extremely similar to the experience of drinking seltzer i understand i cant hold it accountable because of the style but it just doesnt take hold anywhere in the mouth  might buy again if its very very cheap but i cant see myself ever drinking this outside the setting of a party or to get hammered and i dont have the desire to push my intoxication too far so not likely its honestly not bad its just yknow  i will say that as someone who counts calories its honestly decent and i appreciate having it as an option there are better options but not bad
3252,Keystone Light,1.93,keystone light is simply the poor mans coors light it doesnt taste exactly the same but its similarities puts it in the no frills class competitor ironically coors makes it and i assume it sells as much keystone light as it does coors to select crowds  the beer itself is tailored towards budget conscious crowds the can designs is identical to coors lights can and the pour  mouthful feel is similar  overall its not bad but it does have the market of being budget friend college ready 30 pack of stones for less than 25 dollar mentality
3253,Keystone Light,2.58,12 oz can best by may 22 2023 acquired the 15 pack at the local jewel for something like 799 on sale and a ticks a tick so why the hell not  poured to schlitz clear beer mug a light fizzy straw yellow color head isnt great but there is more than on the last cheap beer i just tried  appears well carbonated s light grains muted fruitiness doesnt smell like much but i suppose that is to style t tastes like run of the mill american adjunct lager corn grain no flavors of wet cardboard or paper which is always a plus touch of sweetness m smooth crisp clean watery very drinkable overall i suppose i would call it to style miller lite is the staple beer in my household and i would call this one a pretty close contender for the quintessential aal  light lager  palate cleanser  beer to have when you just wanna have a beer  keystone light 255
3254,Keystone Light,3.51,light gold minimal head a little retention smells like mineral water light sulphur wow a lager beer tastes very light malt non descript hops enough to balance it out not too sweet i really dont get theawful  rating its actually pretty good if you like micheladas this is perfect  041223 i just read farther down and saw someone comment on how little lacing there was for real omg its fn keystone light and you think theres going to be lacing lol
3255,Keystone Light,2.81,rapidly faded head hardly any lacing tastes of light fruit skin reminiscent of coors beers its most definitely not deserving of this score enjoyable very average
3256,Keystone Light,1.4,this is one of the worst beers that i have ever had it tastes heavily of corn sugar from the fermenting process you get what you pay for as this is a cheap beer if you want cheap there are many other options to choose from
3257,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,2.62,poured from a clear 40 best by june 5th 2023  on a relatively hard pour 2 fingers of dense sticky head form that becomes rocky and over time surprisingly slowly fades body is a deep verging on dark golden yellow surprisingly decent lacing forms good head quality and retention  aroma is not quite present acetaldehyde green apple is very present with a dry light graininess in the back maybe a bit skunky but not quite as much as oe800 smells like cheap beer that got warm  taste is a bit more smooth than the aroma with a touch of bready and biscuity malt but only after the aforementioned acetaldehyde bittertartoff apple flavor passes the flavor is not as sweet as steel reserve and not as sweet as hurricane but the acetaldehyde is just a bit too much still drinkable  feel is actually quite decent especially for the abv not too heavy or syrupy but the feel is obviously full bodied there is a definite dryness and astringency that grows as you drink very drinkable if not quite refreshing definitely a laid back lazy day sorta beer  overall its a decent high gravity lager but i do slightly prefer steel reserve over this closing words its fine but drink it cold
3258,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,3.57,for the malt liquor category st ides isnt all too bad if drank ice cold it will get you loopy real quick cause it hits you like a ton of bricks but then again so does the hangover  anywho its worth a shot for anyone whose in a budget or has a few extra bucks left over to just blow blow it in a 40oz of st ides you look even more cool consuming it in a brown paper bag
3259,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,4.09,drank from a 40 ounce glass bottle scores are based on the style  look  that label is perfect its a flawless design and i love it yes its dated but thats even more reason to love it good colors good font good everything  smell  not much of anything just a slight corny sweetness  taste  buttery shortbread cookies and refreshing malt flavor no offputting bitterness and surprisingly little alcohol taste for the high abv an easy drinker  feel  smooth and silky just the right amount of carbonation goes down good  overall  one of my favorite malt liquors ive had i will always stand by mickeys but this definitely gives it a run for its money
3260,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,3.53,40 ounce clear glass screw top bottle poured into vintage pub glass dated mar0821 2 weeks from now 82 abv and listing the corporation address in milwaukee wi the beer pours bright light honey amber in color with nearly white head the head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles the aroma is cooked grain slightly vegetable the taste is sweet slick corn sugary liquor minimal to zero bitterness the mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a decidedly undry finish overall ok malt liquor the diacetyl is not overpowering and awful here also not the cleanest example and not one i would purchase again
3261,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,4.85,shame this has such a low rating pansies poured into a frosty mug out of a 40 oz bottle because you cant get a good proper aroma in the 40 sue me anyhow aroma wonderful malty hint of movie popcorn with butter is that really that bad when there are beers out now intended on tasting like peanut butter or smelling like grapefruit no not at all cry about it appearance wonderful head like my ex gave before she wrecked my life and married some other guy in 4 months in all seriousness beautiful appearance in a mug looks like a macro beer in an advertisement darker color than most aals instagram worthy taste ice cold smooth crisp hides the potency of the girthy liquid quite well warmed up a bit good yes good dont be a stereotypical snob there are floral notes here along with some hoppy characteristics tastes like it would cost you 3 times more with some crazy label touting independence from the big bad macro evil guys because it is hip to be square right buzz you need a buzz rating if you dont do one youre lying to yourself if you consumed a beer of high abv and posted a review on some godforsaken website like i did 1010 increases luck with the ladies much added confidence hey its how i met my ex mentioned earlier one st ides and i was in 3 hour sex romps and meeting a totally dysfunctional family from the seventh layer of hell before i knew it dont take my word for it get you a 40 oz of st ides today before pabst kills off this legacy brand to help fight racism or some such trite shit it is good and it gets you feeling like you discovered liquid weed also helps you deal with an insane sociopath destroying your life with her delusions incredible brew
3262,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,3.59,pours a clear dark yellow with minimal head that dissipated quickly high carbonation the smell is very malty sweet aroma the taste is malt forward as expected caramel sweetness some graininess and a surprising slight hop bitterness also boozy as the alcohol comes through with this one mouthfeel is crisp easy drinkability with a slight boozy warmness overall dead on for the style of a malt liquorstrong lager there is no pretense with this beer it is exactly what you would expect

3264,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,2.35,oh man do i have memories of this beer lol good times
3265,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,3.1,purchased at some crummy gas station next to where my friend works drank straight from the 40  this is pretty harsh stuff for the first few sips it has a pronounced alcohol taste and its pretty heavily carbonated compared to some of the other 40s ive tried
3266,Truth,4.75,poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter super bowl kickoff beer exceptionally thick nice barrel very creamy
3267,Truth,4.08,after having batch 1 still truth back at row 34 in 2015 i thought theyd make better ba stouts in the future guess i was mistaken  presumptive as this was definitively not that barely any barrel tons of umami flavor thinner body hmm
3268,Blanche De Chambly,3.98,12oz bottle best by january 31st 2025  on the pour it looks like a lot of the haze has settled out but with a solid swirl of the bottle this becomes incredibly hazy with some larger particles of sediment the body is an obviously hazy deep orange and the head is fine but not super long lasting  the aroma is super yeasty but surprisingly malty not as much citrus as expected from a wit but my sense of smell isnt fully here right now definitely has some belgian yeast phenols and to a lesser extent esters  taste is lightly bitter carrying over some subtle but present belgian funk from the aroma but it works well with the bready but crisp malts there is light citrus and the coriander is lightly present and again works very well with the malt and bottle conditioned characteristics a bit lighter than expected from unibroue but again my sense of smell is weak  feel is incredibly smooth and drinkable but with a velvety full malty quality as well super refreshing and dry as well this is just a great feeling beer the best of all worlds  overall this is a solid and uniquely belgian oxymoron right take on a witbier solid yeast character backed up by subtle additions of spice and orange but a nice big and full wheaty malt i would really like to revisit this soon
3269,Blanche De Chambly,3.78,82023 poured from a 12 oz bottle purchased at washington beer store in washington pa  cloudy yellow high carbonation from bottle refermentation  aroma of candied papaya and spices malt  taste brown bread light hint of sweet candied papaya tangy and bubbly leah enjoys the light bready sweetness but the high carbonation not so much

3277,Black Tuesday,4.07,well this will definitely get you lit if you want a clean bourbon forward stout then look no further the barrel is over the top but still under control which makes for an exquisite tasting experience
3278,Black Tuesday,4.52,finally gotten my hands on a black tuesday 2021 version 189 abv  pours out a very dark brown liquid with some translucence during the travel from the bottle to the glass no foam whatsoever no surprise there there is a creamy appearance to it though like chocolate milk towards the center with more light penetration on the outer edges  nose is straight up strong bourbon and oak against a huge roasted malt backdrop ethanol is defintely showing itself chocolate is prevalent here as well sweet confection like a rich caramel interacts with the chocolate and brightens it up  on the palate weve got that huge bourbon for sure oak tannins are strong on this one that chocolate shows up but gets overshadowed by both barrel influence and roasted malt some savory notes permeate this brew this aspect always reminds me of well done street cart pretzels on the back end there is a beautiful dark chocolate covered coffee bean note that lingers for quite some time  mouthfeel brings heat not only from the abv but the tannins as well hot and drying probably would be better off drinking this in the dead of winter but alas here i am in the dog days of summer  overall while i very much enjoyed this brew the time its taken me to snag this bottle combined with the ever rising prices of well everything this one didnt quite live up to the reputation placed upon it perhaps i should have aged this one a little longer anyway despite that great brew but other breweries do great things that are similar and less costly and even more available
3279,Black Tuesday,4.3,2021 can stored in a cooler pours a very dark mahogany brown appearing opaque black in the glass with a fizzy one finger light khaki head that quickly dissipates to sparse patches with slight lacing aroma of dark toasted malt bourbon dry caramel chocolate boozy flavor is bourbon dark toasted malt bakers chocolate raisins dry caramel oaky vanilla and a touch of licorice hot boozy bourbon finish medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess and sharp carbonation ive tried a lot of bourbon barrel stouts in my day and this is the most bourbon forward that i can remember almost like a bourbon boilermaker that was extra heavy on the whiskey fortunately there is a lot of flavor in the base too with good chocolate and oak some dark fruit and caramel that are more reminiscent of a blended strong ale i was concerned with the fizzy pour but despite the quick fade of the head there is plenty of carbonation there is a lot of intense flavor at the start of the taste but the bourbon alcohol kicks in and dominates the finish nice oak and bourbon in the lingering finish the two years this can has on it has not seemed to mellow the flavor much and if it has glad i got an aged one i expected a big boozy stout and this delivered it is a bit on the unbalanced side from the barrel effect but enjoyable im glad about the sensible 16oz can over the traditional the bruery 750s glad i had a chance to taste this classic
3280,Black Tuesday,4.47,poured at 54 black body with some ruby seethrough and good clarity light brown rocky head dissolved quickly leaving no cap retention ring nor lace thick legs sheet the glass on swirl nose is bourbon and black licorice boozy hot retro nasal molasses as beer warms bourbon and bittersweet dark chocolate entry oaky vanilla molasses middle hot phenolic finish hot mouth warmth from 189 abv alcohol bite on tip and sides of tongue full non adjuncty body silky feel light carbonation barrel dry finish overall you better like boozy and i do layers of base and barrel flavors which are well balanced all but for the alcohol which is hot dry oaky linger definitely a beer to be enjoyed one sip at a time
3281,Black Tuesday,3.53,2014 bruery black tuesday 197  seen these on shelves for 50 dollars and it honestly just tastes like deths tar just a bit thinner and a bit less sweety but more boozy even after 8years  poured out very light brown i expected a darker and thicker pour for obvious reasonsand settles dark brown into glass no head whatsoever a lil bit of bubbles swimmin up like salmon   tastes is dark chocolate caramel  big dark fruit and heavily roasted malts with a harsh boozy finish nothing special way too boozy as well i feel the burn in my stomach from each sip and it gotten bit overwhelming after 4 sips mouthfeel is too thin for the high abv in my opinion  always wanted to try this one and very happy i did to whoever sent me this one a million thanks cuz much happier i didnt get suckered in to paying what those bastards are asking for these bottles   im not afan of the bruery mainly cuz of the prices they charge i get it gotta pay for barrel storageand weird ass beers they make  but may buy one so happens its tuesday once a year in pint can   overall i can see why no ones gives a fuck about these guys anymore this is nothing special compared to a lot of stuff on shelves now and tastes way too hot even after 8 years makes sense why most members of their beerclub have 750s spoiling in their cellars cuz this is hard to finish and cant imagine getting through half the bottle alone  update  still have 13rd of the bottle in my fridge 3 days later cuz i didnt wanna drink anymore the price they charge for these is a crime  pro tip if you been wondering about this and dont wanna buy cuz of the price tag just buy a bottle of bourbon  youll be better off

3290,Moosehead Light,2.6,no beer has ever been more sought after is it heady topper no tree house pliny no no and no it did however prove to be about the most elusive beer in our collection we have been trying to get a hold of this for the better part of 5 years for one reason or another the moose remained loose we tried ordering it in through total wine no dice we tried calling the moosehead rep at a different liquor store same result this was all before the pandemic meaning no trips to canada for md finally this summer after two years of no boarder crossing we brought moose light home it went down like nothing as the boys gathered for a weekend in maine the beer was fine regular moose is better without a doubt much more flavor but moose light while elusive was a pretty standard light beer experience
3291,Moosehead Light,2.66,poured from a green 12 oz bottle has a pale straw color with a 12 inch head smell is very mild a touch of grains taste is weak some hints of beer nothing offensive just not much there at all feels light bodied in the mouth and overall is a below average example of this style
3292,Moosehead Light,3.5,look 35 smell 35 taste 35 feel 35 overall 35
3293,Moosehead Light,2.6,light bodied not very flavorful a half step above club soda tastes like beer flavored carbonated water its a hometown staple where im from so its very common and accessible so i try to be more objective when tasting this beer
3294,Moosehead Light,3,just a solid light canadian beer very refreshing better than molson canadian light good job moosehead
3295,Moosehead Light,3.37,moosehead breweries ltd moosehead light 12 fl oz green glass bottle production coded but without freshness dating  notes via stream of consciousness not surprisingly moosehead light tastes a lot like moosehead its just not as rich nor as hoppy ill assume that theyre just adding water to lighten it but it could be more complicated than that i doubt theres any highgravity brewing going on that produces more than just one beer though its too clean and balanced for that its very well made and the balance that you find in the regular moosehead remains intact its just a little lighter and more refreshing of course i still prefer the standard moosehead but if i have to have a light beer this is one of my goto lights so let me run through its good points and bad points as compared to the regular 1 the appearance is not as good the clear strawgold body is nice but the head retention and lacing are lacking 2 the nose is lacking the beautiful combination of sweetish grainy malt and herbal and floral hops found in the original just isnt there its still ok for a light beer but not nearly as full or bright 3 just like the aroma the flavor is watered down most likely literally theres some grainy malt which is nice and some lightly floral and softly herbal hops but its not completely satisfying again as a light beer it works and the cleanliness and balance are impeccable 4 the finish is good it remains dry but with some malt and hop character remaining which is rare for light beers as they usually just disappear from the palate 5 the body suffers a little bit but not by too much and the carbonation is gently crisp its not too watery conclusion its at the very least refreshing i think everyone will give it that but its also fairly satisfying  its like youre drinking a real beer and not some hopless and almost maltless carbonatedwater two thumbs up as far as light beers go
3296,Moosehead Light,2.07,clear yellowish liquid in a green bottle aroma of corn rice husk and a bit of skunky hops the flavor has crisp adjunct flavor and a small mineral and skunky hop presence light bodied carbonated well subpar beer
3297,Moosehead Light,2.1,pours the color if ginger ale pretty much a watereddown version of the standard moosehead lager the skunkiness in the lager is lessened but so is the general flavor
3298,Moosehead Light,2.08,from club del gourmet of el corte ingles in ikeas pilsner glass watchig worst week 1x05 another industrial lager and worst than the typical one
3299,Moosehead Light,2.6,apours a golden color with a slight head and lacing aaroma has lemongrass hints tthe taste follows the nose with a lemongrass flavor ma medium bodied decently carbonated beer oa decent beer
3300,Guinness Draught,5,why didnt i try this sooner poured into a guinness glass it was a peaceful moment watching the bubbles settle first sip bitter like a good coffee and dark chocolate smelled of roasted coffee beans rich in flavor mouthfeel creamy and smooth not heavy easy on the stomach it was so good i had another one day ill enjoy a proper pour until then this is a staple in the fridge
3301,Guinness Draught,4.2,the nitro draught in a can is the best version not from a tap and is in regular rotation at my house particularly during the colder months i dont really like the heaviness or bitterness of other stouts and dislike the sweetness of porters but this version guinness is very smooth and clean tasting
3302,Guinness Draught,4.68,amazing beer when from draft of a can less so from a bottle but still solid
3303,Guinness Draught,4.68,love it no other words
3304,Guinness Draught,5,pint in the long haul dublin decided to base my rating off the better pints i have hadof many at its best its unrivalled creamy bitter dry pure heaven
3305,Guinness Draught,3.77,appearance served from both a 149 nitro can and more impressively a tapkeg poured into a chilled guinness pint glass the tapkeg service in particular accentuates the beers visual appeal it presents an even more impressive creamy head that intriguingly billows down to the bottom of the glass a spectacle that is delightfully captivating after a 90 second wait the drinking begins whether from the can or tap the beverage exhibits heavy lacing and a longlasting head however the visual drama of the pour is distinctly amplified when served from the tap  scent the nose is greeted by the aromas of roasted barley and coffee  taste the flavor profile carries over the scents of roasted barley and coffee but also introduces notes of chocolate fruity yeast and a gentle hop presence to maintain freshness though not complex it is extremely wellbalanced despite a low grain bill the fruitiness of the yeast and the smoothness provided by the nitro infusion alleviate any harshness from the roasted barley the beer is surprisingly easy to drink  mouthfeel the upfront creaminess from the nitroinfused head contrasts nicely with the light and slightly watery texture due to the low grain bill this brew is easy to drink refreshingly light and quite popular in warmclimate countries  overall this is a wellcrafted light stout that is not only refreshing but also sessionable it has become my goto beer for st patricks day and beyond given the nitros gentleness on the lower urinary tract symptoms luts indeed guinness seems to be onto something  i might start finishing some of my homebrews on nitro  this light stouts low grain profile can lead to variable harshness of flavor if not consumed fresh guinness on tapkeg presents a superior taste and creamier feel featuring the nitrocarbonation twang without the excess harshness of the roasted barley which can come off as an ashtray taste in cans think of it like the difference between freshly brewed coffee on tap and coffee thats been sitting on heat for a while cans  overall scores nitro can 325 on tapkeg 400
3306,Sanctification,4.07,dated 053014 and stored in a box down in the dark cool basement poured in a fluted glass for a quick review  a sparkling dark gold pour that produces zero foam and nary a carbonation bubble the weak cork pop kind of gave away the carbonation deficiency the smell is mostly brett funk and some light fruit a taste that begins with white grapes followed by some brett funk and a hint of musty wood the feel is slightly acidic and dry  overall id say it has aged gracefully for being 9 years old a little more carbonation would have been nice but its drinking very well on a 90 degree afternoon
3307,Sanctification,4.4,from a 375 ml bottle for 20 pricey at monks in philly poured into a tuliplike glass bottled on 090517  in my opinion more sour than brett straddling the line 425  a  pours a clear very pale golden yellow with an almost zero head which faded quickly to just a thin constant ring around the glass 425  s  brett aromas with some minor funk and a good amount of stomach acid sourness minor citrus notes 425  t  tart but not overly sour or mouth puckering faint sweetness when coupled with the tartness reminds me of an oddly carbonated lemonade no metallic or minerally feel like i get in some sours 45  mf  medium light body with a dry tart finish 475
3308,Sanctification,4.24,375 ml bottle corked and caged dated bottled 010919 so assuming january 2019  pours a crystal clear light golden in color the picture looks more hazy because its humid and there was instant condensation bight pillowy head that condenses down to a thin cap but great head retention and leaves rings of lacing on the glass bright slightly tart lemon aroma a touch of grassy funk taste starts with crackery pale malt in the middle hits some floral and citrus notes then finishes quite dry thinner bodied effervescent lively carbonation overall very nice seems deserving of its 3 spot on the top rated list of brett beers
3309,Sanctification,4.11,pours clear with a lot of bubbles a 2 finger head smells rich like its aged in wine barrels tastes like carbonated dry with a little bitterness dry feel more dry than a chardonnay
3310,Sanctification,4.32,serving 375 ml bottle bottled on 090721 poured into a spiegelau beer tulip  appearance slightly hazy straw yellow with a sudsy cap of white foam and faint lace  smell yeasty pizza dough wet wool citrus blossoms  taste crisp light dry and delicate with farmyard funk minerals spice and a light acidity  mouthfeel light body and gentle but lively carbonation  overall complex yet restrained dry and refreshing with some nice nuance
3311,Sanctification,4.21,bottled 9721
3312,Sanctification,4.3,bottled on 09052017 enjoyed on 1106221
3313,Sanctification,3.84,pours a clear golden straw color with a massive airy semirocky white head thats fairly quick to dissipate and leaves soap bubble lacing  fairly dry woody aroma with maybe an underlying hint of clove  super clean taste a little wood a little clay very dry finish very very faint hints fruitiness peak through at various points in the form lemon and grape but overall the taste exudes clarity and dryness  light bodied and bubbly effervescent feel  well crafted but a little too clean for my taste especially when drank next to other russian river offerings
3314,Sanctification,4.12,poured from a bottle almost clear pale gold straw color with long lasting white foamy head nose is funky with whiffs of fruit and wet hay taste follows with a funky briney tartness finishes almost dry
3315,Sanctification,4.71,this beer was very enjoyable soft carbonation nice amount of tartness with sweet to make it very well balanced very refreshing if you ever see this on the shelves grab one
3316,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.05,42923 very well done roasted malt coffee forward smooth head dissipates quickly would like to do a head to head vs guinness
3317,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.53,came upon this when ordering from craft beer cellar i love complex coffeeforward beers so this sounded like a good choice i had to drink from the can so i wont be able to comment on the color head or lacing even from the can i can smell a roast coffee dark cherry and cocoa the taste is much complex than what i got from the smell a combination of dark chocolate and roast coffee toast leather and a bit of ash as it wamrs mouthfeel is of a medium body with moderate carbonation that is extremely smooth i will definitely be ordering this again listed as a irish dry stout i can see why its rated
3318,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.26,time to knock out another style topper here we have the highest rated irish dry stout on ba and one that has apparently held similar titles for a long time per the notes cadillac mtn stout was selected world champion dry stout 1995 and the best hardtofind beer in america by mens journal cool shit lets see if it can live up to the expectations ive built up in my head after having this marked as a want for 3 years  pours a muddy medium brown with a finger of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  as expected the roast is very evident in the nose but it is nicely balanced as well im picking up on aromas of acidic coffee dark toast charred malt toffee sweet honey herbal hops and cocoa powder  its also quite smooth in taste for the amount of roasted malt thats present on the front end of the sip im tasting dark chocolate medium roast coffee burnt toast caramel herbal hops and dark cherry the swallow brings notes of acidic coffee cocoa powder earthy hops dark toast toffee light raisin and a touch of char  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a roasty and slick beer finishes mostly dry and surprisingly refreshing  yeah this shit is awesome super easy drinking even for a style where drinkability is pretty important definitely deserving of its ranking i think ill have to stock up on more now that i found it
3319,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.3,lovely beer drank it at the brewery which was a great place in the woods not much head but lovely taste quite a coffee vibe going on
3320,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.16,pours a dark brown color with ruby edges and a finger of beige head the nose has roasty notes but also something sweet and almost toffeelike roasted malt is the feature of the flavor profile the finish is gently bitter  i could drink this offering all night no wonder its the 1 irish dry stout
3321,Cadillac Mountain Stout,3.74,meh bitter
3322,Cadillac Mountain Stout,3.99,purchased as a 6pack in bottles look deep inky black disappointing lack of head taste hits you pretty strongly with a blackstrap molasses sweetbitter combo some bready flavors dark pumpernickel overall its a decent beer but more of a sipperthe persistent bitterness means it doesnt pair well with food and youre ready for something different after one round of this stout
3323,Cadillac Mountain Stout,3.61,12oz bottle poured out an opaque jetblack color with a small khakicolored head of foam it smelled roasty and chocolatey with toffee notes sweet chocolate taste with some roasted notes
3324,Raison D'√ätre,3.32,this was deeply appealing by description not sure if it was the yeast or maybe bad bottle but the stuff was kind of bitter and frankly a bit nasty scoring more objectively with benefit of the doubt
3325,Raison D'√ätre,3.03,sampled bottle rbnag 2007 in grimstad abv is 8 amber to copper colour low head boring aroma slightly malty malty flavour notes of caramel hints of cinnamon
3326,Raison D'√ätre,3.49,32oz crowler purchased two days ago at js liquor owensboro poured into a dfh branded teku glass at fridge temp 8 abv the beer pours mostly bright medium brown with ruby highlights and essentially no head no retention or lacing the aroma is faint brown sugar and maybe a hint of dark fruit the taste is slightly sugary with raisin flavor before an alcohol hot barely bitter finish not real complex and scary close to cherry cough syrup the mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with below average carbonation and anundry finish overall subpar i got a stupid deal on this crowler 5 and i imagine that this keg had been on tap for quite a while with the restrictions on shopping i would still try this from a dated bottle or a bar that does a brisk business numerically rated close to the existing average for fairness
3327,Raison D'√ätre,4.03,pours a dark nutty brown with a hint of burgundy head is a finger of khaki foam head retention is good aroma is strong  plum dark fruits raisins fig and caramely malts a little bit of alcohol seeps through but just barely flavor profile carries the same profile forward hitting notes of plum dark fruits raisins fig and toffee with caramely nutty malts underneath alcohol is a little more apparent here mouth feel is full with a mediumthick consistency that firms up to thick when the glass has been warmed slightly light graininess adds a little texture to each sip overall heavy and full with strong raisins and dark fruit qualities  served in a 155oz speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle reviewed from notes
3328,Raison D'√ätre,4.48,why is this no longer available in georgia when craft beer and microbreweries first started to get popular in the metro atlanta region back in the early 2000s this was one of the very first beers that i saw from the movement certainly without a doubt the first dogfish head i ever saw i havent seen it round these parts in probably 1314 years too bad becauise this is a really good one and i wish i could have one right now
3329,Raison D'√ätre,4,ive had this it makes me think of shawn gallaghers wedding i went to visit shawn and we stopped at dogfish brewery ah bliss i was like a kid in a candy store i have fond memories of dogfish as it was the new yorker article about dogfish that got me into beer as you can tell i am an intellectual aesthete
3330,Pink Killer,2.15,april 2017 250 ml bottle from vinmonopolet nettbutikken abv is 5 hazy pale pink colour small white head aroma of pink grapefruit juice and artificial candy some herbal notes too pretty awful flavour medium sweet but not as sweet as i feared notes of artificial candy a slight grapefruit bitterness in the finish will not buy again
3331,Pink Killer,2.67,bought after being very attracted by the camp labelling the beer pours a pinky orange colour as youd expect from a beer based on pink grapefruit and has a small fizzy white pink head smell of grapefruit citrus quite inviting taste is a massive let down very sugary and artificial tasting i doubt any actual fruit every became involved with this beer the finish is horribly cloying and sticks to the back of the throat with the fizziness accentuating this unpleasantness this beer is like a attractive woman that leads you on only to spurn you and accuse you of getting the wrong idea
3332,Pink Killer,1.74,de decervecitas en copa grimbergen en almuerzo con al alb√≥ndigas  chocos fritos subid√≥n de az√∫car no es que este tan mala pero esto debe ser hasta malo para la salud
3333,Pink Killer,2.25,de color rosado con una muy peque√±a cabeza espumosa de poca retenci√≥n cuerpo y carbonataci√≥n media aroma maltoso y afrutado en boca es dulce pero no al punto de ser empalagoso
3334,Pink Killer,2.51,weird pours a pinkishorange with lots of carbonation but no head smells kind of grapefruit and kind of peachy taste is very artificial of grapefruit peach cherry and slightly peptobismol medicinal aftertaste thin body high carbonation and huge sweetness makes this drink like a cola i could see people liking this but the number has to be very limited
3335,Pink Killer,2.76,poured from an 112 oz bottle into a pint glass looks like pink lemonade tastes like sugar water the best part is the pink  white bottle cap with a dog none on it
3336,Aaron,4.48,2016 bottling
3337,Aaron,4.77,bottle generously shared by seth dark brown pour with a kaki head big booze and caramel malt aromas big booze caramel malts and dark fruit highlights wow this is fantastic mild oak and vanilla sub tones complex with a great body and mouthfeel an incredible example of this style

3340,Gouden Carolus Cuv√©e Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.08,poured from a bottle into a snifter lightly sweet some brown sugar fruit and berry medium body and carbonation great beer to step away from stouts and ipa for an evening
3341,Gouden Carolus Cuv√©e Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.3,cant believe i havent rated this classic before ive definitely had it in the past but not for years so i picked up a nicely priced 1099 corked and caged 750 bottled in 2021  this beer looks phenomenal with a very dark brown body approaching black and a tan head of tightly clustered bubbles that retains strongly and leaves creamy sheeting on the inside of the glass the smooth fullness of the body with moderate carbonation is also a very high point i was actually surprised at the restrained effervescence as for me its dead on and lively without getting too spritzy which ive encounter with many other belgian beers i actually uncorked this near the sink to be on the safe side but no issues whatsoever there  nose is the weaker side of this beer nothing bad here but simply understated and mild hints of dark chocolate bready malt restrained alcohol raisin on the palate the alcohol is again present but contained in a very pleasant way sweet dark fruit and chocolate predominant subtler vinous qualities and suggestion of baking spices unfolds gradually revealing depths of flavor as it warms  what a treat i love to mix it up with an old school european classic now and then and this fit the bill fantastically on a chilly early spring evening
3342,Gouden Carolus Cuv√©e Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,5,best beer in the world and there are so many awesome competitors thank goodness

3348,Gouden Carolus Cuv√©e Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.21,pours brown with ruby highlights the foamy tan head diminishes pretty quickly after pouring big time nose of raisins and figs very smooth on the palatea nice mediumbodied ale told it ages well but couldnt resist this 2021 effort early in 2022 for a younger ale of this type it was very smooth even without too much additional aging the flavors are rich and as they are described primarily dark fruit plums caramel and gently roasted malts a treat worthy of an emperor
3349,Gouden Carolus Cuv√©e Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,5,this is my favorite beer of all time
3350,Mexican Brunch,4.55,pours jet black like coffee without creamer little to no carbonation thin in appearance and feel the smell is noticeable as soon as cracking the bottle the taste follows the smell sweet cinnamon and coffee dominate with subtle hints of chocolate maple is faint but adds a nice sweetness chiles almost non existent but thats fine by me really enjoyable after dinner drink
3351,Mexican Brunch,4.24,taking brunch south of the boarder kane brewing looks to chili peppers cinnamon and cocoa to give a decidedly mexican twist to their imperial milk porter  mexican brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly as a scent of coffee rises first a quick followup of syrup chocolate nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent fully malted and sweet on the tongue high impressions of chocolate caramel maple toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions  as the flavors start to unfold the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy nutty and roasty tone cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice woodsy earthy and toasty the beer trails into a kahlualike finish with balance and contrast in taste  full bodied and soothing on the finish the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a mexican inspired alcoholic cappuccino
3352,Mexican Brunch,4.57,500 ml bottle poured into a teku  a black with a two finger mocha head  s chocolate cinnamon some maple coffee some chili pepper very well balanced  t chocolatefudge coffee maple syrup some peppers cinnamon slightly earthy  m smooth creamy full body  o a very well done and balanced mol√© stout easy to drink and a nice kick from the pepper even though it is on the more mild side
3353,Nugget Nectar,4.48,16 oz can freshest by 05062023 poured a semiclear copper color into a samuel smith imperial pint glass with visible carbonation and a frothy white head that lingered  left loads of lacing earthy pine resinous overtones in aroma with hints of tangerine peach apricot tropical fruits and malty goodness flavor follows nose with a nice malty bittersweet backbone for a finish sits mid to back of palate with slight carbonation tingle on the tongue a little part its prime but this is the last one i was saving to see if it changed with age remember it pretty much the same an outstanding offering from tr√∂egs world class indeed
3354,Nugget Nectar,4.25,pours a light clear amber thick foam dank hop aroma big sticky hop body very dank heavy bitter finish thicky thick if you like hops hops and more hops give this one a try
3355,Nugget Nectar,4.21,dark copper colored with excellent clarity theres a quarter inch of densely packed beige on top heavy soapy lacing is present the aroma is of bready malt and piney hops im tasting sweet bready malt and a flourish of pine in the back of the palate the mouth is resinous and theres a nice long hop burn at the end
3356,Nugget Nectar,4.64,scored the last sixpack at local deli the flavor profile is fantastic and love the resiny mouthfeel wow this beer deserves a mic drop
3357,Nugget Nectar,4.43,flavors of apricot jam peach preserve brown sugar graham crackers toffee orange zest and savory mango malty soft and smooth with hints of tropical fruit aroma follows the palate but with more emphasis on the orange zest mouthfeel is crisp and highly drinkable but still relatively full bodied and rich  easily one of the best imperial red ales on the market
3358,Nugget Nectar,4.95,the single best food or beverage to come out of hershey pa
3359,Nugget Nectar,4.24,very good red ale one of my favorites
3360,Nugget Nectar,5,outstanding highly recommend received as a gift going to get more
3361,Nugget Nectar,4.26,dark copperamber but bright and almost translucent a clear pint glass full of it reveals theres virtually no head to describe but thats the philly style of serving draft beers even without a head its a lovely beer little aroma rises above the glass a little malt a little hops and no discernable alcohol this is one of those that doesnt offer much to the nose but gives the tongue a workout quickly its learned that regardless of the word nectar in its name this isnt some sort of overly sweetened ale there is some sweetness provided by ample malting but this one bites theres just the right dose of alcohol in the mix that it amplifies the sharp hoppiness which is noteworthy with notes of pine and citrus this is a bitterly hopped brew a good thing that brings so much more character than most in this style the glass lacing is a little short so this isnt one for the nose and maybe not long for the eyes it is a complex hopfest within a solid malted body
3362,Nugget Nectar,5,rare 5 out 5 looking for balanced and if so high marks it will receive no hop bomb but you can taste the some of the excessively dry hopped but sage quickly to a malt creamy goodness if youre looking for a hop slinger move on but if youre looking for great tasting grab it whem you can cheers
3363,Nugget Nectar,4.19,16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bottle shop for 455 freshest by 04282023given that this was released pretty recently january 10th i would say that this beer is less than one month old  look pours a clear medium amber color with a tancolored head that slowly dissipated to a very thin layer looks very nice  smell very nice aromas of fresh hops  earthy resinous pine along with some dankness woody notes and grapefruit notes theres a bit of caramel sweetness underneath all of that hop aroma this beer smells a bit like a slightly stronger version of sierra nevada celebration ale  taste its surprisingly balanced refreshing and drinkable up front it has a very nice maltiness with the caramel notes coming through briefly before being taken over by hops the finish is actually not nearly as bitter as i was expecting its relatively smooth and has a pleasant longlingering bitterness that is not very intense nice grapefruit rind flavors on the finish also  feel the mouthfeel is a bit chewy nicely carbonated medium plus body  overall this beer brings back memories the first time i had this beer was in the mid to late 2000s in atlanta someone had acquired this beer in a trade i think and brought it to a beer share i was blown away by this beer there arent many other imperial red ales out there one that i used to consume a lot of was terrapins big hoppy monster fast forward to living in pa i moved here just over 10 years ago it was probably 9 years ago when i made a feeble attempt to procure some nugget nectar i called a beer distributor that i passed on my way to work and at that time the state laws only allowed them to sell entire cases i wasnt able to buyconsume that much beer so i passed hard to believe that its been over 15 years since i have had this beer enough with story time this beer certainly deserves its 1 ranking among imperial red ales  from the can and website color straworange hops nugget warrior tomahawk simcoe palisade grain munich pilsner vienna yeast ale  its impossible to forget your first squeeze once a year as the newest humulus lupulus harvest arrives at tr√∂egs we blend these superfresh hops into an imperial amber ale exclusively dryhopped nugget nectar is an explosion of pine resin and mango

3380,Cuv√©e De Gr√¢ce (2023),4.47,canned 7723  this is a massive cuv√©e using a blend of 7 different component beers given the lineup of beers in the blend i have a hatd time believing that this will be anything short of amazing lets crack it open and see what its all about  pours almost completely pitch black with 2 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  the nose is definitely sweet but in a complex way that doesnt become cloying im picking up on aromas of dates toasted oak toasted walnut molasses black cherry sweet bourbon brown sugar milk chocolate light caramel and orange peel  its even a touch sweeter in taste but still so well executed on the front end of the sip im tasting black cherry molasses cocoa powder dark toast burnt caramel brown sugar raisin toasted oak sweet bourbon and poached pear the swallow brings notes of toasted oak molasses sweet bourbon black cherry orange peel cocoa powder brown sugar vanilla toasted coconut and light raisin  a medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth beer finishes mostly dry and drinks well below its abv  this is so damn good im not surprised given revolutions reputation for massive barrel aged beers but im just happy to be drinking it
3381,Cuv√©e De Gr√¢ce (2023),4.53,the appearance is the color of a barleywine but the opacity of a stout light brown with very little translucence at the edges nose is oak for days accompanied with bourbon caramel vanilla roasted malt coconut dark fruit and ethanol for sure taste is similar strong oak presence slight dark fruits covered in confection roasted malt bringing a very faint chocolate and coffee and some hop presence the ethanol heat doesnt seem to be too strong on the palate it is drying but it doesnt illicit images of deserts in your mind the mouthfeel is medium to full bodied almost no carbonation overall a great brew i didnt realize this was a whopping nearly 16 i thought it was around 14 seeing as ive finished this can and my vision is swimming i can say that while this brew does not hide its power on the nose it does it better while drinking which i feel matters just a little bit more
3382,Cuv√©e De Gr√¢ce (2023),4.57,canned 07072023  a pours black a onefinger tan head on an aggressive pour quickly and loudly dissipates to a thin layer clinging to the circumference of the glass no lacing of note s oak bourbon dark chocolate small bit of vanilla t follows on from the aroma for the most part  oak  bourbon showing their heft but notes of chocolate help to provide a nice counterbalance on the proceedings m medium mouthfeel with low carbonation creamy o this beer requires patience patience to allow it to reach near room temperature as this is when it really flourishes imo just a fantastic blend of rev ba beers here outstanding beer
3383,Cuv√©e De Gr√¢ce (2023),4.62,my goodness this is absolutely exquisite layer upon layer of complexity with nothing to suggest an abv approaching 16 i get warm notes of boozy fruit gently drizzled with chocolate coconut and vanilla so much more here but im just going to sit back and enjoy this
3384,Cuv√©e De Gr√¢ce (2023),4.56,pours blackishbrown aroma is incredible  intoxicating well balanced sweetness of caramel brown sugar oakiness  bourbon taste is also complex combo of caramel brown sugar hints of vanilla chocolate and charred oak mouthfeel is full and matches the taste outstanding
3385,Cuv√©e De Gr√¢ce (2023),4.76,8 ball black with a short tan head that fizzles out in large foam bubbles fairly quickly  deep oak chars vanillin and peppery whiskey introduce the infinite complexity of this incredible blend that only gets better as it warms it deftly avoids being oversaturated decadent or sticky with an illuminating carbonationfor lack of a better word to describe how it unveils layer after layer of novel characteristicsthat helps it to nearly vanish in the finish  the less than viscous medium body actually improves the expressive delivery of its idiosyncrasies i cant get over the depth here particularly how im failing to find descriptors that do it justice but even more astonishing is how there isnt really any burn despite the nearly 16 abv
3386,Cuv√©e De Gr√¢ce (2023),4.49,canned 7723 drank 8123  the yarchives  blackbrown appearance  a violent pour yielded a huge noisy tan head which quickly dissipated no lacing remained  oak dark chocolate cream  booze heat notes in the nose  creamy thick mouthfeel  dark chocolate  cream flavors up front oak  a hint of orange peel on the finish booze heat emerged as this warmed  cold this falls flat but at near room temp it shines another winner from the deep wood series

3391,Headroom,4.6,pours a very hazy fleshy peach color with a fluffy off white head that leaves ringlets of lace as you enjoy the beer gorgeous hazy  the nose is dank and packed with sweet peach aromas orange peel some grapefruit and lots of mango and pineapple this is literally a beer fruit basket of aromas  the peach flavors lead the taste and are delicious with the orange mango and pineapple flavors following with a bit of green grapes mid palate and a nice creamy oat flavor on the finish very balanced and oh so delicious  the mouthfeel is full soft and creamy adding to the drinkability this is a magnificent representation of the style imho
3392,Headroom,4.24,on tap cloudy bruised peach with a typical hazy head that clings to the edges pretty well nose is melon and unripe tropical fruits midway through without any agitation giving the beer a swirl ripens the fruits pretty quickly giving a sweeter impression overall some sniffs expose an overripe burn but its not the norm  when cold the beer opens with an almost tart fruit note which contrasts poorly with the more bitter middle and finish it doesnt completely disappear as the beer warms but it does mellow out and blend in better the sweetness notes in the nose after a swirl pervades the opening through to near the finish reducing the contrast but taking the bitterness i enjoyed in the back end of a colder beer  this beer went from a disjointed start with highs and lows to a more balanced but also more typical very good hazy
3393,Headroom,4.53,on tap pours a beautiful hazy glowing orange smell is an immediate assault of fresh grapefruit followed by layers of berry and a touch of dank taste follows feel is smooth and dang near perfect no booze no burn outstanding

3405,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,3.64,starting the pumpkin season a little early but its my fantasy football draft night this is new belgiums atomic pumpkin spicy release it looks innocent with its transparent amber color and white head and the nose is complicit with its graham cracker aroma there isnt much pumpkin flavor but the chilies dominate the flavor and mouthfeel your tongue will tingle but its not overpowering or offputting like other spicy beers ive tried theres a sentence i never expected to write i feel like this is more of a gimmicky beer but one worth a try
3406,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,1.24,honestly its undrinkable
3407,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,3.25,bottle from boise coop pretty standard fare here normal amount of pumpkin spice bright dark golden with a small soapy head taste is more of the pumpkin spice kind of generic but it is that time of year
3408,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,2.2,i wish id noticed the spicy part on the label what a horrible surprise
3409,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,3.81,clear amber body with a small off white head and light lacing aroma is more focused on the pumpkin rather than the pumpkin spices although they are evident especially cinnamon nor did the aroma foretell the impact of the peppers on the tastebuds theyre there from first sip to the finish and add a different dimension to the style

3411,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,4.02,12 oz can with best before dating of 20aug2022 stamped on the bottom  lightly hazed dull copper and leaves a shite ton of fine bubble splattered sheeting all over the glass  on the sniff i pick up notes of blistered chili pepper  tasty chili infused brew with the chili presence ratcheted up pretty higha bit more then a moderate chili burn upon each sipi wish all fall themed pumpkin beers took this approach being a rather large chili headwell worth a try
3412,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.39,95 on the bottle  upon opening up this bottle it gushed and lost nearly half the bottle not sure as to quality control with this one  appearance  pours a copper brown with a finger of bubbly white head  smell  fruity esters of raisin plum and fig low spicy hops toffee malts caramel and earthy yeast  taste  fruity esters of raisin plum and fig upfront but not potent enough for the style the hint of spicy hops come through next the toffee malts caramel and earthy yeast round out the brew the flavours are not that potent which is very dissapointing  mouthfeel  medium bodied with moderate carbonation finishes a tad thin  overall  a disappointing brew that started off on the wrong foot nearly loosing half the beer due to gushing is a terrible sign of this brewerys quality control perhaps this was an offbottle
3413,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.71,15 liter magnum bottle rbesg 2005 grand tasting abv was 10 intense oaky and malty aroma flavour is also intensely oaky and moderately sweet i probably drank it too warm will need to rerate when available at cellar temperature as it was its not my definite favourite but obviously a well crafted beer

3432,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.89,on my initial pour i was like very good butafter several additional samplings i have changed that to this is excellent and possibly my favorite beer currently pours a hazy golden color with a thick creamy head and significant long lasting lacing smell is very wheat beer like with a fruit sweet aroma alcohol content is a little high at 77 my only complaint is the availability sometimes a little hard to find locally
3433,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.78,poured from 112 oz bottle to a weizen glass looks solid gold slightly hazy unless you swirl and add the sediment at the bottom of the bottle then it gets pretty cloudy some carbonation bubbles popping up white head falls to a thin cap some sticky lacing left behind in the glass smell is banana clove ripe apple a slight citrus smell taste starts sweet and fruity with apple banana citrus up front middle of the sip tastes of clove pepper more banana finish is spicy with pepper up front clove and allspice mixed in maybe some cinnamon and a long banana clove wheat cracker peppery aftertaste feel is medium to full bodied with a nice tight carbonation almost coats the tongue feel is very smooth and easy to drink with a bit of alcohol warming in the end overall wow i really love this beer so much flavor so easy to drink the abv slows things down a bit but this is worth taking slow honestly i think i have a new favorite beer
3434,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.5,i am so glad i tried this beer pours a hazy gold the smell of banana and clove is incredible has a bit of a bubblegum taste with a slight peppery finish i could drink this all day but with high abv i would be in trouble
3435,Punkin Ale,3.5,12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass look is burnt orange tan head falls off to nothing smell is pumpkin pie spices brown sugar taste follows with pie spices up front through the sip mouthfeel is lighter side of medium decent carbonation overall a one and done for me but not bad
3436,Punkin Ale,4.96,when i smell a beer this delicious and warming i expect to look at a stout theres some cloudiness but the nose backs it up i pick up mostly a dry hop flavour maybe thats a characteristic of pumpkins that i am not aware of i was leary of the beer cos i dont like too many added flavors but it did everything but disappoint
3437,Punkin Ale,3.66,consumed on 23 nov 2022 glass chalice abv 7 abv serving temp 516 f   look dark orangetinted copper thin offwhite fizzy head quickly dissipated to a thin ringandislands pattern lacing is ok  smell some light very light pumpkin aromas but mostly spices strong spices cinnamon dominates along with ginger and some cloves as well there is a sugary sweetness underlying these other aromas  taste follows the nose the sweetness takes on notes of candisugar and really balances out the spice notes the ginger becomes the dominate spice in the flavor the pumpkin is far in the background here nutmeg can be detected in the aftertaste  feel crisp but also a tad syrupy the body is mediumlight if that  overall i am not a big fan of pumpkin beers but this is one that i dont mind perhaps because the pumpkin flavor and aroma is quite muted since i dont drink many pumpkin beers the spices really do jump out at me
3438,Punkin Ale,5,to me this is basically the perfect beer
3439,Punkin Ale,3.81,pours a pumpkiny orange color with a retentive head  smells of cinnamon and pumpkin  taste is of pumpkin and sweet malts  very decent not very pumpkin heavyi like it
3440,Punkin Ale,3.94,overall a very good pumpkin beer can taste the spices and brown sugar but not overpowering like some pumpkin beers will buy the beer again though a little pricey in the midwest
3441,Punkin Ale,3.93,this is a pumpkin beer you can find easily on the east coast i always recommend this beer for people every pumpkin season its extremely enjoyable this is a quality pumpkin brew folks
3442,Punkin Ale,4.06,medium amber pour with an offwhite head it was darker than many pumpkins i have had the smell is with the typical nutmeg cinnamon and all spices that are typical for pumpkin beer reminds me of pumpkin pie as i drink it good very good
3443,Punkin Ale,4.05,very good not crazy pumpkin  not too strong
3444,Punkin Ale,4.11,one of the best pumpkin ive tryed  great pumpkln and spice flavor without being strong
3445,Desperados,3.03,i did not expect to have something like this while in belgium this clear burnt golden beer was served with a lime in its somewhat gaudy bottle much like a corona lol  drinking the first few sips after removing the lime it kind of reminds me of tequila barrel aged turbo shandy in that it has a bit of a honey character that comes off stronger than the botanicals and is a little on the sweeter side theres perhaps a touch of toasted corn far in the background but its pretty one notethus the lime
3446,Desperados,1.94,poured from a 330ml bottle  pours dark straw with a tight bubbled head and high carbonation the smell is soapy weirdly sweet and citrusy and the taste follows on  the sweetness is so offputting they use glucose syrup in this and you can taste it strongly  it is also somehow unpleasantly bitter in a chemical feeling way  the mouthfeel is mostly syrup and fizz  overall why is this popular probably fashion and a pretty high abv  its like a bad lager mixed with a sprite with tequila in there somewhere but its all gone wrong 
3447,Desperados,1.73,appearance pours a golden crystal clear body no appreciable head formation as it instantly crackles away like a sprite  smell the d smells of four generous pumps of raunchy tequilaflavored syrup into a lowgrade cheapo lager  taste quite sugary  artificial lime and tequila additives abound there seems to be an unenjoyable beer underneath but its difficult to discern beyond the tequila lollipop candied deal long loonnggg aftertaste with a weird chemically twang and final pop of artificial sweetness  mouthfeel thinbodied soda popesque carbonation kinda fizzly  overall unpleasantly sweet remorselessly chemically
3448,Desperados,1.11,this is the worst beer ive ever had i have nothing positive to say about it like cheap macrobrews get poor reviews because theyre boring and uninspired this isnt boring or uninspired but i really wish it was i imagine this is what it would taste like if you mixed mikes hard lemonade with a busch light that was left out half finished the morning after a frat party also a hint of cough syrup just truly disgusting  the look is fine i guess fine enough that i thought this purchase could possibly be a good idea darker than one might expect probably artificially colored if i had to guess the nose is stale and sweet a little malty the taste is like a collaboration between flavors that hate each other again stale and sweet slightly acidic maybe like citric acid was added or something i dont detect any tequila flavors none of the vegetal qualities that define tequila honestly i dont think this is even beer closer to a flavored malt beverage but i would pick any flavor of four loko over this  only try this is if youre curious about how bad it is
3449,Desperados,1.43,you have no idea how much this is being drunk here in the netherlands skunky and sweet smells awful and tastes like bitter induced bad lemonade awfully popular among my friends and peers no idea why
3450,Desperados,1.55,from a can purchased in france clear golden color with white head sweet corn aroma medium body tastes like sweet grain with a side of cheap tequila had this several years ago but its still memorable as the worst beer ive ever had seriously just drink a better beer and then take a shot of tequila itll be more enjoyable that way
3451,Desperados,1.56,someone who invented this had to be on solid drugs worth mentioning that if someone from higher position who really tasted that in heineken and said like yeah well thats something we really have to produce and send out to the market  they should have get rid of him mixing beer with tequila isnt obviously a good idea and it completely ruins what i see in beer well someone could like but not me the flavors dont work out together for me and are a chaos it literally tastes like some messed up radler sewage dishwater  dump it
3452,Desperados,2.52,sweet hell is there a hell if so this is what they would serve on tap there nah it aint that bad but is it in reality it tastes more like soda than beer  which is about as cool as a soda tasting like a beer when raul was a tyke nope  be well my children
3453,Desperados,1.81,the first words out of my mouth were holy shit what were they thinking  sugar buttered toast sugar and more sugar on the nose mouthfeel is not insubstantial but nothing special tastes like someone mixed budweiser with sprite added a few drops of tequila and a feckton of sugar i had to add some guinness to make it palatableand even then i couldnt finish it  cannot recommend this frankensteins monster of a bier
3454,Desperados,1.33,desperate this so undrinkable for any beerlover perhaps the worst beer in the world alongside corona and cubanisto truly awful stay clear from this stuff
3455,Desperados,2.09,didnt want to rate this as a beer despite the deceptive lager appearance although upon closer inspection the carbonation is nothing like a true beer its more like a wine cooler if you look at it that way theres less sugar in thisdrinkthan a wine cooler so not too awful came close to pouring this down the drain but something about it kept me wanting to drink it will not buy again despite the cheap buzz
3456,Hahn Premium Light,2.14,look standard mass produced adjunct beer golden straw colour very thick dishwasher shop head approx 3 fingers thick which quickly fades away to a thick almost whipped cream texture  smell light grainy bitter smell citrus lemon again somewhat dishwashing up liquid   taste sweet malty grassy grain dry after taste  feel light watery refreshing if drunk on a hot day and the beer is cold  for a lightalcohol full strength beer its got enough flavour and just enough body to be enjoyable its watery but more flavour than some midstrength beers on the market  its as bland as the rest of the generic australian lagers but you do get to have a few and still be sober
3457,Hahn Premium Light,1.26,wouldnt normally go anywhere near this sort of beer  but a situation meant it was that or nothing else im far more into quality over quantity these days  and as i was about to drive home  a non alcoholic decent ginger beer would be a far more satisfying choice tasteless in the extreme  i honestly dont see the point of drinking this truly awful
3458,Hahn Premium Light,2.27,asked for australian beer on a qantas flight and this was what they had clear golden color with white head light grain smell light feel with plenty of carbonation light malt flavor with a dry finish ok but nothing to recommend it
3459,Hahn Premium Light,2.27,crispy and light nothing too fantastic
3460,Hahn Premium Light,1.02,taste like shit i would prefer to have coca cola instead of hahn premium light
3461,Hahn Premium Light,2.98,a clear pale and lively golden yellow with a small fading white head aromas of grass grain and corn following onto the palate similarly light body and a watery mouthfeel medium carbonation and a lowintensity short length bitterness in the finish
3462,Hahn Premium Light,2.24,had this early while watching hockey figured light would be best at 10am from notes  a  poured golden bright one finger of fluffy white head good drapes of lace all the way down and a film of retention  s  light malt sweet grain dried leaves  t  dried leaves again sweet grain quite grainy not overly good  m  quite dry in the finish with good carbonation light body seemed really dry  od  unpleasantly dry an odd beer the dryness was funky and the flavours werent pleasant wouldnt get it again the alcohol doesnt exactly give you any bang for the buck either even though its so light it still has an unpleasantness
3463,Green,4.64,darker yellow very hazy pour lots of citrus and pine on the nose flavor follows suit but adds a touch of pineapple strong bitterness follows leaving you wanting more
3464,Green,4.27,this is another treehouse that varies a fair amount in taste due to either a batch or time measured by the week or b day to day based on my particular taste buds that said it is always good but sometimes it is fabulous
3465,Green,4.79,4 pack from sandwich location look is hazy dark yellow to orange taste is a little more bitter than sweet pine tropical fruit mango papaya mainly and some citrus mouthfeel is medium bodied and soft overall a great ne ipa plain and simple
3466,Green,3.25,probably my least favorite of ths ipa but stillgood and in a blast bette than most this one seemed less juicy to me and more plain of an ipa but not one id eve turn down
3467,Green,4.33,look  thick tannish orange with a big lasting sticky white head and lacing smell  green smells green fresh pineapple citrus orangetangerine taste  that has a lot going on pineapple orange like the smell along with way more more bitter than almost all ne hazy beers with a slight grassypine feel  medium body with a medium slightly light carb and a lil fluff overall  great blend between a great ne and a great w coast kind of has both
3468,Green,4.9,157 yum
3469,420 Extra Pale Ale,5,mmmmmmm yummy beer make me silly hehehe
3470,420 Extra Pale Ale,4.75,its about a perfect pale ale as you can get the beer has a spot between sierra nevada and an ipa more flavor than sierra but not as robust as a standard ipa at 57 it is perfect for summertime drinking pale ale are my favorite beers if youre a pale ale fan then take it from me this is good
3471,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.53,slightly more hoppy than other pales ales i have tried
3472,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.91,a very nice pale ale similar to sierra nevada but a bit less bitter in the finish it would be even better if it was infused with ganja
3473,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.81,poured from a 12 ox can into a willi becher pint glass l  pours a clear medium amber color with a significant whit head that dissipates slowly s  smells of pine and grapefruit t  taste matches the smell pine citrus and some maltyness f  medium body  carbonation o  easy drinking pale ale
3474,420 Extra Pale Ale,2.85,its pretty watery sweetwater just like the name faint aroma of hops grassy pale look if budwesiser produced pa it would taste like this one
3475,420 Extra Pale Ale,4.06,16 ounce draft pour into a tumbler pint glass  l orangishyellow a touch cloudy small white head probably subdued by the server fades to a ring in less than a minute s bright hoppy aroma mostly citrus almost juicy t hoppy subtle orange flavor pine comes through later in the glass enough malt to balance the clean zesty bitterness f crisp feel gives an overall light impression but does have a bit of heft not thin or weak o quality apa more american traditional but has some limited juicy character havent had this out of a bottle or can but this draft pour is pretty good
3476,420 Extra Pale Ale,4,on draft at dulles airport no surprise its much better than from the bottlethink ill have another
3477,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.61,it is what it is a solid not spectacular pale ale great for pool days summer activities or tailgating crisp refreshing not mind blowing but good
3478,Susan,4.02,draught bitter and black pepper meh
3479,Susan,4.9,159 yummy
3480,Susan,4.87,golden amber with a modest and enduring offwhite head a full clear pint glass full just spilled out of a tap head as with many hazies this doesnt punch the nose but it is pleasant theres a pleasant starchy backing for resinous hops which arent at all that bitter to smell theres a near perfect softness to the mouthfeel just like a hazy styled aipa should provide unlike too many others its neither too thin nor too sticky the same goes for the hopping it too is close to perfect for the style its vaguely resinous with a hint of a spice like lemongrass coriander or pepper with some nice glass lacing this also looks close to perfect overall this is one incredibly good beer outside of new england this is a rare find when it shows beer geeks are on their phones to their buddies and it doesnt last long
3481,Susan,4.82,one month old can to wine glass  l pours an opaque golden brownish orange with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing no floaters  s hoppy and slightly malty with notes of ripe orange honey pines and stone fruits herbal and grassy  t malty with caramelly and bready notes on the one side hoppy with a fruity sweetness on the other side honey peach and a bit of pineapple  f crisp and crushable with a medium carbonation soft and smooth  o i think ive never had a beer with less than 8 abv that was as complex and flavorful as this one even though it drinks almost as crisp as a lager all kinds of malty and hoppy notes keep popping up absolutely outstanding
3482,Susan,4.34,canned 121322  alright its time the highest rated american ipa on ba ive been wanting to try this one for quite some time and im thrilled to finally get the opportunity to ive been seeing more hill farmstead beers near me as time goes on and im excited by all of it lets see if it can truly live up to the hype  pours a lightly cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves nice lacing  the nose is somewhat delicate for lack of a better word but still shows an excellent balance of all of its elements that ends up turning out really nice im picking up on aromas of orange zest pine sap bready malt grassy hops honey pineapple juice white pepper grapefruit zest and light orange marmalade  in taste it falls a little bit flat of the complexity on display in the aroma not exactly onedimensional but more focused on bitterness on the front end of the sip im tasting grapefruit zest piney hops bready malt weed white pepper honey light passionfruit and pineapple the swallow brings notes of crackery malt white pepper piney hops fresh cut grass honey grapefruit zest passionfruit and light orange  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick and sharp beer finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness  while i think this is quite good its nothing mind blowing theres better examples of the style out there but id also like to try this fresher one day as ive heard hf can be really particular about the best by dates on their ipas
3483,Susan,4,poured from tap into a 12 oz tulip glass at positive pies in plainfield hazyish golden yellow with one fingers worth of head light citrus taste coupled with biscuitbread tones good hop presence but not overpowering good
3484,Corona Light,1.6,yea if your desperate
3485,Corona Light,2.06,left in the can aroma is sweet corn tastes metallic some fruity notes malt its not too too bad at first glance i had it rated 275 for taste but then an absolutely horrible aftertaste comes in and lingers mouthfeel is ok overall it just isnt very good and for the price there are much better light options available
3486,Corona Light,1.98,pours out of the can a crystal clear goldenorange yields a finger of fizzy head that dissipates quickly smells like sweet corn and malts taste follows the nose not too much going on here you like it or you dont its pretty basic
3487,Corona Light,3.63,the more beers i try the more i realize that what people think are bad or what people think are great are blinded by their pretentious ideas of what they should be like taste like everything personal is subjective i try to rate and enjoy as objective and also subjective as i possibly can no matter the style or my prefered tastes  that said i do like me some light beers and im surprised it took me more than 500 different beers tried before i got to this one this is beer 514 actually more but some i couldnt find on here and with that accumulated experience i will say this is a fine if not damn decent light beer blew my expectations away and i think i prefer it to the extra or premier i work 56 days a week i like something quick and refreshing after a 10 hour day and this does it smooth drinkability with a light crisp feel to go down easy like others of this style relaxing and enjoyable on a hot day or after a laborious shift nothing complicated or a lot to process just a clean beer to drink  will it be my preferred beer of choice no i like to change it up every so often but i think i will fit this into my normal rotation
3488,Corona Light,1.6,i really like corona extra and premier so i figured i would go for the light this time that was where it all went wrong i opened the first bottle after chilling it and it smelled like cigarettes i got past it by giving the bottle a few more sniffs but the smell was not like the other corona i have had the taste was also very bitter and rough not very smooth not a good flavor compared to the others  pretty disappointed hopefully it doesnt ruin extra and premier for me
3489,Corona Light,2.73,ive been waiting my whole life for this its the first time ive ever gotten a corona light when i asked for it ive never even seen it at grocery stores although to be fair ive only looked once or twicebut god damn this was at huge box stores with massive macro selections to be perfectly honest i was damn near certain this was a hoax that didnt actually exist so it was to my utter surprise that our local dirt cheap mexican restaurant not only listed it on their menu but actually delivered it to the table as ordered thus was my ultimate bucket list whale slayed  the overall experience is as expected light ricey skunk however it was also surprisingly toasty i typically find the lighter versions of macro lagers to be the lesser of its representations but since i have only ever had regular corona extra up until now im finding myself flummoxed that im not entirely sure that light is the worse of the two bottle to bottle id probably take this over extra even the lightly fluffy medium body isnt impacted too terribly by the lightening  to wrap this up the appearance within a lime wedged bottlewhich itself i find slightly less attractive than extrais otherwise lightly chillhazed piss yellow with after a tilt a relatively active but rapidly receding carbonation  dont worry i removed the lime wedge and serviced the tip liberally prior to this exhaustive review  enjoy
3490,Corona Light,1.77,had this at a friends house since that was all that they had it really was offensive but i drank it anyway wow i thought regular corona was drinkable when really thirsty but this light version is just not worth it
3491,Corona Light,2.62,12 oz can best by 822 i spent twenty years drinking mostly coronabud lightmiller lite so the smell and flavor of this beer are very familiar the game changer is canning this is the first nonskunked corona i can remember so to start the worst flaw is gone clear gold with one finger fine white head spotty lacing partial surface ring corn light floral pale malt bready odors not much flavor light apple corn grass its fine if that is what you are accustomed to light hop zing low carbonation  dry finish insubstantial but no glaring flaws wet and alcoholic cheers
3492,Corona Light,1.56,what could be worse than perpetually skunky and corny beer  how about watereddown corny skunk  i never expect good choices at holiday picnics but this is a new low
3493,Corona Light,2.5,much better beer in a can
3494,Ayinger Br√§uweisse,4.31,from the bottle at pies and pints morgantown 9423 happy labor day  aromas of banana pear candied lemon light clove and sweet brown bread coats the mouth well  sweeter and more carbonated than the weihenstephaner yet a great offering perhaps not as deep in complexity as we would like  very very glad to to have tried this one
3495,Ayinger Br√§uweisse,4,not my favorite style but that being said this is pretty good big foam light golden color definitely a wheat beer with some citrus flavors easy to drink i like the bigger bottle it does have the german flair good one
3496,Ayinger Br√§uweisse,4.62,05l bottle dated 040324 included in a mixed six pack purchased in the brewery hotel lobby in aying this style is one of my least favorites but when i drink a worldclass example i immediately know and this is quickly evident upon taking a few gulps perfectly balanced malt bill and yeast qualities without being overly spiced creamy smooth satisfying what a beer
3497,Ayinger Br√§uweisse,4.33,very interesting feels the typical wheat taste is more subtle refined it has almost champagne like quality reminds of saison or even ne ipa nelson hops taste is pears green apples vanilla a hint of cloves and banana slightly bitter and dry end medium body at max different and very nice
3498,Ayinger Br√§uweisse,4.3,on tap cloudy to a high degree but not perfectly blocking all light lovely uniform white cap promotes a lot of initial lacing feel is a bit light and bubbly and not quite as smooth as i expected taste is a dialed down version of the nose which is heavy on a mix of not too ripe banana and spice as i sip i appreciate the balance in the more and more as it is pretty evenkeeled while still exhibiting the qualities the style is known for
3499,Ayinger Br√§uweisse,4.62,appearance cloudy straw yellow white creamy mousselike head with good retention  aroma banana clove and grassyherbal notes  flavor and aftertaste yeasty flavors spicy hops restrained bitterness  mouthfeel medium to light bodied soft feel moderate carbonation dry finish  overall excellent hefeweizen has all the expected hallmarks of a german made hefe detected a grassy herbal note that i have not in most german made versions which added to the interest short drying finish well crafted
3500,Ayinger Br√§uweisse,4.3,two 112 oz bottles l1028 into a tall weiss glass l pours matte murky gold and is straw at base a white 12 creamy head w vg retention down to a thick skin well carbonated and good to final sip almost no lacing the lack of lacing could be due to high temps and high humidity s banana clove floral yeast t banana bread clove yeast wheat nutmeg a hint of fruit peach a touch of salt precise balance of flavors and is moderately pale f gently crisp then smooth soft med to medlight body with a slightly chubby middle and a clean dry medfast finish o amazing whisper finish along with incredible taste make this beer outstanding superb drinkability and flow quenching would love to find it on tap
3501,Ayinger Br√§uweisse,4.18,hazy paler than expected looks beautiful in the glass light and smooth nice carbonation creamy and full mouth feel banana bready yeast and wheat with lovely subtle spice coming through sweet and dry finish beautiful specimen
3502,Ayinger Br√§uweisse,4.19,smooth crisp and spicy different finish than other hefeweizens ive tasted quite enjoyable
3503,Ayinger Br√§uweisse,4.71,purchased as a 12oz bottle from the blue door for 450 poured into a weizen glass  l  hazy pale orange with a threefinger pale white head head dies down after a minute really good lacing s  candy bubblegum clove and freshlybaked bread t  closely follows nose super balanced bit of a lemon peel note finish is dry and full of wheat f  medium in body with medium carbonation refreshing and super drinkable o  cant believe i havent formally reviewed this yet ive had this a million times fantastic hefe closely rivaling weihenstephan great to drink in the middle of the day will purchase again definitely recommend
3504,Ayinger Br√§uweisse,3.57,from carwyn cellars october 2022 drunk in march 2023  l hazy sunset yellow in the glass with a large pillowy head that didnt last as long as expected yes my glass is clean small amounts of carbonation can be seen in the glass  s cloves bubblegum vanilla and candied lemon all heading in the dr pepper cherry direction no maltwheat body discernable  t quite sweet with the bubblegum and ripe pear that dr pepper note is there too but i wonder now if thats the ripe pear that im tasting regardless it brings to mind that chalky dr pepper cherry taste that doesnt taste at all like cherry but remains stubbornly associated with it theres a long sweet finish with the vanilla coming out retronasally after the swallow the overt bubblegum and extra sweetness mark this one down for me  m carbonation is mild and the mouthfeel is full and as expected from the hazy appearance of the beer  o im resolutely sticking to the style in rating this one and the sweetness that i pick up and that dr pepper note means the beer is not as refreshing and light as a hefeweizen should be so im marking it down  cheers 214
3505,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.61,750ml bottle 2016  pours a deep red with 2 finger pink foam head which dissipates after a few minutes relatively low carbonation aroma is cherry with notes of wood and perhaps sour citrus taste initially strikes the perfect balance of tart and sweet cherry with a hint of spice but the sourness becomes more prominent medium bodied with a dry finish absolutely teriffic beer
3506,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.17,750ml bottle into a tulip 2018 vintage  looking very nice slow streams of carbonation through a deep plum body small pinkish tinged head replenished though little lacing  tart cherry aroma with the faintest of funk notes  on tasting cherries are the strongest flavor but they dont overwhelm nice balance tart and sour  mouth medium finish tart sour cherry  overall enjoyable drinking experience perfectly balanced for my fickle palate

3509,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.25,review 1538 my continuation for trying a bunch of different beers this beer is a fruit lambic i picked up a month or so back the beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass the pour of the beer created a twofingered pinkish head with excellent retention the head did not leave any lacing on the glass as it slowly dissipated the head is creamy and foamy and settling to the bottom of the liquid the color of the beer is 0reddishpurple with clarity  the first aromas in the beer are cherries lightly toasted malts and sour lemons nosing further i detect a touch of horse blanket wet grass toasted crackers oak and hay  the flavors in the beer are cherries fruity sweetness oak leather a touch of farmyard funk sourness like lemons toasted crackers hay and lightly toasted malts  the mouthfeel of the beer is tannic tart and carbonated  the body of the beer is light high carbonation and medium finish  the beer has a beautiful tartness and finished crisp the fruit comes through but is not overpowering the touch of farmyard funk is pleasant and gives the beer uniqueness solid fruit lambic i enjoyed it
3510,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.4,750ml green bottle caged and corked bottle label lists abv as 6 for belgian cherry ale dark reddish brown colored body slightly pink beige colored head which persists as a thin bubble cap just a few small spots of lacing left behind aroma has cherry and oakleather farmyard funk taste is a balance of cherry sweet and tart the funk is more in the later portion and shows oak lemon and leather the more tart cherry and oak revisit in the aftertaste medium mouth feel with a dry finish good carbonation sublime and balanced use of the cherry with the base lambic all works together and nothing out of place
3511,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4,375 ml bottle pours hazy dark red with tall longlasting foamy pink head aroma is of barn yard yeast vinegar and cherries body is medium and tangy taste is of cherries wheat malt funky yeast and vinegar finish is long and very sour nice sour brew
3512,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.5,750 ml bottle corked  pour is a very dark naturallooking red very thick with a nice pink head  the aroma is all cherries sweet and dark with some very light spice nodes shining through as it warms a bit  the flavor is a straightforward iteration of the style but done to nearperfection cherries dominate throughout organic tasting very juicy backed up by yeast spice and tartness its very smooth and drinkable from start to finish never getting too sour or sweet the balance is exquisite
3513,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.23,poured from a bottle into a tulip glass deep reddish purple color with good initial head and nice lacing distinct smell and taste of tart dark cherries some pepper and cinnamon spice a bit of tart apple and some mellowing pear flavors as well a very nice lambic
3514,4th Anniversary,4.52,2023 anniversary version  really good ipa  nice hope mix  excellent balance  next to no booziness for 10 as is ohs way  creamy with plenty of citrus backing  very solid
3515,4th Anniversary,4.62,its a great triple slightly nuanced hoppy tropical satisfying mothfeel hits all the marks for my palate
3516,4th Anniversary,4.28,while i enjoyed the initial fruity aromas and flavors the finish was pithy and harsh so i tried it again when they rereleased it this iteration is less boozy fosho granted this definitely has some heat but it has a great body its well hopped and its pretty tasty
3517,4th Anniversary,4.28,4th anniversary reboot for 8th anniversary
3518,4th Anniversary,4.09,cloudy orange with a fat finger of dense offwhite foam head good retention and thick lacing  big pineapple aroma with tropical starburst dank jungle weed and mango beneath  pineappleforward taste as well coupled with an interesting herbal note that lends some slight bitterness in the finish there was fairly strong playdoh in there at first too it might have been connected to the head because it faded after the first few sips  full bodied with fairly zippy carbonation  lots of fantastic elements in this the playdoh was a huge let down at first but again that offflavor didnt last too long
3519,Coors Banquet,3.36,drank a lot of this in college in wyoming many moons ago but have not had one in at least 25 years a 6 was 239 back then so yes ancient times grabbed one tonight  looks good but loses a little for poor foam retention  smell is clean and light sweet malt a little fresh mown hay and a faint earthyfloral hop presence so faint i may be imagining it  taste is light all around but malt is a little firmer than most aals bitterness balances the other light flavors very light floral hops that balance well with the malt  feel is a bit more substantial than its competitors without being out of style satisfying could do with a little less carbonation belching as i write this though some may consider that a positive  overall very good for what it is a cut above most similar beers back in the day coors was looked down upon in co and nearby states i actually set up a blind tasting on my dorm floor and was able to convince my classmates that it was good stuff still remember this beer on tap at the brewery as one of the best ive had
3520,Coors Banquet,1.76,12 ounce 355 ml can poured into shaker pint glass nice head of foam smells faintly of grains tastes like beer mouthfeel clean crisp refreshing not too snooty and low abv at 5 good for football both euro and american i would give it a soid b bbd 1223 btw personally i prefer tennents but that i s a rare animal around this here parts lol
3521,Coors Banquet,3.45,i like this beer its incredibly light crisp and refreshing when served chilled the look is a straw yellow with a quick dissipating foam head lots of grain flavor its infinitely better than budweiser
3522,Coors Banquet,3.05,pushing 18 years on this site and ive never reviewed this beer before let alone ever had one im in colorado now and this may as well be the official beer from here as its pure rockies down to that whole mountain water thing  golden just like its origin as it was straw in hue bubbly enough and left enough lacing behind to stay on par with the foam that never fully dissipated from the surface adjunct corn and cream were in the nose as the taste was equally sweet filling and quasiartificial plenty clear and crisp from the water this was plenty oldschool and colorado  down to the 1936 stubby bottle that this was served in  enough carbonation was in this to keep it lively as this oddly reminded me of genesee cream ale that was a staple of yesteryear back east as this would fit that bill had i grown up in these parts no this wont win any awards but its worthy enough to have banquet on the label as its a true original worth a go once for anyone looking to have a true allamerican beer
3523,Coors Banquet,4.5,fantastic beer its a major brewery for a reason no it wont make the beer snobs happy but i dont enjoy 1520 bucks for a 6 pack of ipas 9 bucks for a 6 pack of the iconic stubby bottles im in tastes great a little like banana bread to be honest i dont know why this gets such low marks crisp great tasting and cheap count me in make beer accessible again
3524,Coors Banquet,3.38,im a beer snob however this beer is drinkable its good cold and on a hot day ratings are to low
3525,Coors Banquet,3.54,pour very light pale crystal clear white sudsy head that falls and leaves rather quick to leave nothing but a thin ring  nose is lightly sweet somewhat syrupy faint grain and faint hop presence i want to say floral but they are so faint  taste is same lightly sweet malt that the nose showed again somewhat grainy lightly hoppy finish  prickly and bright on the tongue light bodied goes down incredibly well whats nice is despite all the lightly sweet it finishes quite clean and dry  a pretty well crafted macro aal quite tasty imo
3526,Coors Banquet,3.34,look pale yellow with a frothy white head that quickly forms and begins to settles ending as a pillow and leaving spotty lacing behind aroma steeped cereal grains wafts of floral hops straw baking biscuits and soda crackers taste starts off with cereal grains and crackers closely followed by light and subtle floral hop notes that mix in well some straw and biscuit appear throughout and closes as it started mouthfeel light but not too watery clean mediumhigh carbonation and crisp and clean on the finish overall in case youve been living under a rock in beer land and never had coors original before its an aal that does what it is supposed to do  refresh quench and not bring too many flavors to the table this does just that and isnt bad in a sea of aals that contains plenty of awful ones
3527,Coors Banquet,4.01,very nice drinkable and considerable at 5
3528,Coors Banquet,3.5,look  clear pale straw small white head dissappeared very quickly zero lacing smell  fruity banana taste  sweet fruit banana malty feel  light body well carbonated crisp overall  shes drinkable and probably one of the better american adjunct lagers available sweet fruit and banana on the flavor with a lingering sweetness its well carbonated and crisp too im not going out of my way for it but it was nice to revisit of course i was jamming to east bound and down by jerry reed a tip of the cap to snowman and fred hammer down
3529,Coors Banquet,3.25,12oz stubby bottle best by stamp on bottle is oct0923 clear pale gold colored body one finger of white head which disappears quickly leaving an active surface storm and thin ring leaves behind a few scattered lacing spots aroma is kind of green apple fruity with a toasted malt base taste is white bread green apple and corn with a touch of sulfur at the end aftertaste has a little spice and quite a bit of malt thinner mouth feel but not watery minor tongue sting very good carbonation its a beer thats refreshing but not very rewarding on flavors easy sessionable brew
3530,Coors Banquet,4.56,my two favorite california ipas bit the dust this year so its time for me to go back to good old coors banquet still my favorite of the american mega brewery lagers here in the western usa coors banquet was one of the staple beers of the twentieth century every grocery store quickie mart and gas station has it the taste hasnt changed a bit during the decades that i have known it banquet is still brewed only at the golden colorado brewery the only question for me was should i buy cans or the 1936 stubby bottles i taste tested comparing bottles with a best by date three months into the future side by side with cans dated four months into future both containers had the same twoday stay in the refrigerator so they would have equal temperatures 36 f the coors banquet in the 1936 stubby bottle was the decisive winner no question about it from the bottle i could smell distinct spiciness of hops which was barely noticeable from the can carbonation bite on the tongue was lively with the bottled brew and a bit dull from the canned finally the malt was more full and sweet from the bottle glass makes a big difference whether its ipa or american adjunct lager coors banquet in glass easily beats my second choice lager modelo especial in glass
3531,Taiwan Beer,2.14,i love pale lagers even adjunct ones so im not rating low just because of the style instead its because this is flat soapy maybe a little lemony and oddly filling considering just how little it appeals to the palate not a great export at all this is from a six pack of 104 oz 330ml green bottles with no date  maybe stored badly additionally  mine says 5 abv not the 45 that others report but its definitely taiwan beer
3532,Taiwan Beer,3.63,poured from an undated 12oz can into a pils glass  on the pour a 2 finger head that pokes out of the top of the glass forms then slowly recedes to a rocky slightly fizzy head then to just a covering over thentop after 10 or so minutes body is a light golden straw with a very light chill haze  aroma is incredibly light and very clean based off the aroma alone and the inclusion of rice as the only adjunct i disagree with the current aal classification and believe this is much closer to a japanese rice lager light hops are present and a very light but clean lager yeast note malts are quite light and what is there is rice crackery  taste is very similar to the smell again very light but insanely clean and detectably hoppy everything about this is light but the hops are floral and fruity woth almost zero bitterness and the yeast notes are light dry and again vaguely fruity the finish is where the malt comes in and it is very light and crackery with rice lightness present but the rice itself doesnt contribute much to the flavor once the beer warms a bit there is a bit of a dirty lager finish but it takes a while for it to set in and doesnt cover the good parts of this beer  feel is light and very dry with a decent carbonation bite very refreshing and drinkable but the mouthfeel is incredibly dry not the softest beer in the mouth a bit of a fizzy feeling finish is medium long but clean  overall this is an impressive asian beer more than just another boring pale lager it has some defining features and a nice floral hoppy note very dry and surprisingly good i only got it because i kept seeing it at total beverage and the can looked nice but this is actually impressive and memorable
3533,Taiwan Beer,2.69,never seen this before in the states until today dubbed classic now its a fine asian brew fuller bodied and slightly sweeter than most but also mysteriously and thankfully missing the yucky parts of most of these no metal no corn no adjunct cheapness and while its not all that good its also not all that bad and thats at least as valid in this style range especially from this part of the world where our american standards really do not apply in the same way and i am thankful to be trying this especially with a heady vegan curry burrito you never know what you are going to find out there simple stuff here international lager type but slightly big malt liquoresque to me a little adjuncty but not as offensive as so many and in this category i think its decent it cuts spice its not objectively cheap and there is great carbonation here that said i wouldnt choose this even over a basic available lager type here molson canadian labatt blue heck even high life wins here but its shooting its shot and i dont hate it smells and tastes like the can but whatever its fun especially in this food context always been an international yellow beer nerd and here is another one life is good
3534,Taiwan Beer,2.42,5l bottle from fu bonn market medium golden clear initial foamy head heads fades to small cap grainy aroma adjunct grains cooked vegetables taste is sweet and grainy light vegetal notes creamy feel drinkable
3535,Taiwan Beer,3.01,import adjunct lager the first one went down pleasantly but i tried pouring the second into a glass better experience chugging cold out of the can pale pale yellow in color with decent head and lacing for the style cereal grain is the first scent i pick up with hints of old world hops plus something musty in the back very thin feel to the 45 finishes cold and fizzy albeit on the watery side grainy notes persist better in the can for certain as the less desirable mustiness is less noticeable
3536,Taiwan Beer,3.13,look  golden color transparent small head that dissipates leaving virtually no lacing smell  syrupy sweetness with some malts and rice fragrance no skunkiness and actually quite pleasant overall taste  unfortunately the taste did not make up for the smell fairly watery no hops presence and light malty flavor finishes with slight sweetness a strong indicator of the proportion of rice used in this brew feel  light bodied high carbonation on par with most adjuncts at 45 abv overall  an adjunct that is quite pleasant on the smell but standard on the taste nothing atrocious but nothing amazing either
3537,Taiwan Beer,3,purchased in a nc grocery and poured from a 12oz can a nice lightgolden pour with a 1 finger head that vanishes continually working carbonation s an appealing nose clean sweet malts straw and a little citrus t nothing special but certainly not a bad beer sweet malts ponlai rice i assume responsible for the sweetness but pretty clean not corn syrup and not vegetal like nasty stateside macros some straw and something passing for a very light lemoncitrus finish on the tongue straight at you beer crisp and refreshing m wellcarbonated just short of zippy not pasty not syrupy again the word clean o again offering nothing special but definitely a decent lager for this palate not exactly comfortable looking at down the pipe 3s but its an honest and fair evaluation from these beer senses
3538,Taiwan Beer,2.97,not that bad that you would suppose after sering the ratings it has a slight sweetness to it that is not annoying so the beer remains drinkable though a weak lager it was okay with taiwanese food
3539,Taiwan Beer,1.08,i poured this straight in like the brewer suggested but its very hard to drink smells like airplane glue taste even worse like drinking a bowl of rice this may be the most popular beer in taiwan but what other beer choices do they have the low scores are very appropriate for this beer nothing i would want to drink again
3540,Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,4.56,12oz can courtesy of dimidiata been sitting on it for a bit and decided it would be an excellent valentine for myself  poured into a snifter it was the color of the mood of philadelphia eagles fans right now virtually no head besides a very thin line of tan bubbles around the rim not a great looking beer but its not surprising considering how strong it is  as expected it smells like a big stout brewed with the adjunct ingredients of vanilla and bourbon barrels with an unexpected touch of what smells like graham crackers smells like a luscious dessert  tastes like it smells but better its not a subtle beer but you dont drink beers like this for subtlety the bourbon barrel flavor is fairly mellow and refined and the vanilla is at a level that melts well with that unlike a lot of beers ive had with vanilla added to it that graham crackery thing i noticed in the nose is present in the taste as well i do not believe any graham crackers were abused in the making of this beer perhaps its a byproduct of the vanilla and bourbon mixing it is utterly delicious thats for sure  fairly creamy mouth feel body is somewhere between medium and full  this is a glorious dessert beer perhaps also my last from modern times but hey theyre going out on a high note with me thanks christine
3541,Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,4.71,look  black thick nice tan rimmin and lacin smell  taste  loads of barrel along with really nice vanilla and chocolate feel  thick and creamy with a light carb ovrall  fantastic and a must have
3542,Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,5,2020 version poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter at home on 1242021 for a vanilla lover like myself the vanilla aroma and flavor as well as the viscosity of this beer is wonderful
3543,Foggy Window,4.34,from a 16oz can dated 082923 served in a spiegelau ipa glass captip to franktank18 for his resourcefulness incidental generosity and just how murderous he looks in a tie  pours an opaque milky orange with two fingers of airy whipped egg whitelike foam retention is fairly decent leaving a fizzy cap and sudsy slippery lacing  nose is pretty faint but what there is of it seems to me sugary candylike aroma of lemon drops and orange lifesavers  taste is less sweet than expected drier and more tart tasting lemon rind tangerine and gooseberries some astringency standing in for actual legitimate bitterness  but not such that id care to complain about it  feel is dry and drying clean and maybe feeling a bit lighter bodied than it really is due to fairly aggressive bright and fizzy carbonation theres a mildly acidic and boozy smoulder in the gullet not unexpected given the abv  overall tasty and gone all too soon in accordance with can instructions i shall now refrain from operating machinery for some appropriate period of time
3544,Foggy Window,4.48,appearance  the beer was the expected hazy orange color with a fluffy white head topping in the glass  smell  the moment i open the can  it radiated oranges the sweetness was penetrating  taste  from the moment of the first sip the profile was very orange forward however it was not all candy fruit as there was a nice level of bitterness there were notes of fluffy dreamsicle orange throughout the taste  mouthfeel  this was a thick one with the haze clogging the spaces in between teeth  overall  this was a benchmark new england ipa
3545,Foggy Window,4.28,16oz can into a founders snifter  nice pale orange color creamy white head nose is citrus fruit overripe white peach and clementine juice very aromatic beer opens peach gummy clementine and cantaloupe cane sugar sweetness and more citrus fruit in the middle some resin and grapefruit dryness in the end body is light with moderate carbonation soft and velvety on the palate and goes down dry with a long lingering finish super drinkable  great balance with an incredible mouthfeel
3546,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.13,12oz bottled 050223 4 months ago poured into a new holland signature chalice at fridge temp 11 abv the beer pours opaque brownish reddish amber with khaki colored head the head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles lots of lacing the aroma is mild with hints of caramel oak and bourbon the taste is semisweet caramel malt with subtle bourbon and barrel along with some earthy hops and moderate bitterness the mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish abv is fairly well disguised with just some heat on the tongue and tummy to give it away overall very good
3547,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,3.79,12 fluid ounce bottle served in a perfect pint glass  this beer pours rust colored with copper highlights it is topped with a beautiful tan head that leaves nice lacing  i get some vanilla and caramel notes hints of booze as it warms  sweet flavor or caramel and vanilla the alcohol comes through as it warms  medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel  it reminds me of kentucky bourbon barrel ale
3548,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,3.9,just a touch lacking in clarity for a red ale strength and barrel aging notwithstanding strong head production with good retention and lacing body is quite dark in color appearing closer to a brown ale in dim light but shining with an almost pinkish hue lighter than ruby red against bright backlight  aroma prominently features bourbon banana toast and caramel an interesting blend from the malts barrel aging and yeast expression cola and prune emerge but with a slightly brighter tinge than you get from stouts theres an almost fall or winter aspect to this as though subtle spices were added although i dont suspect thats the case  the beer cant quite deliver on that complexity on the palate although its overall similar a touch too sweet bordering on cloying i suspect this is partly due to the bourbon tasting notes of brown sugar toast caramel prune pepper bourbon  pretty easy sipper appropriate for the style and abv theres some alcohol heat but its not overpowering this is a beer you want to drink slow but you should want to drink an 11 abv barrel aged beer slowly  overall not the most complex or amazing beer in the world but a worthy and enjoyable effort
3549,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,3.4,from liquor shed in casper bottled january 23rd 2023  it pours a clear deep amber red with a great head of foam long lasting superb lacing  the smell is bourbon lactose sugar some woody notes  the taste is bourbon lactose wood dark pitted fruits alcohol hidden okay  mouthfeel is fine a sipper not as easy to sip on as others in the general abv range its weakest component to me is the taste not worthy of a repurchase
3550,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.04,12oz bottle served in a snifter bottled on 050223  appearance dark translucent copperyamber with an offwhite head some strands and islands of persistent lacing which was a surprise with this high of an abv  smell oak a bit of vanilla some mild malt and herbal notes  taste malty some toffee some dark stone fruit notes some oak and a hint of vanilla there is some booziness under all of this as well there is a mild bitter finishbut i cant quite pull it out under all the other flavors  mouthfeel good thickness brisk carbonation warming dry finish  overall  drinkability a definite slow sipper and its an unusual mix of barrel aging and an imperial red ale just minus all the hops i feel like the hop notes if they were there to begin with got muddled this beer has aspects of an english barleywine but its not quite there nor is it an american barleywine either and its not an imperial red ale either id classify this more an an american strong ale its good just not quite exactly anything i can put my finger on or identify lets go with unique
3551,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.09,murky dark amber red body with a hint of orange offwhite head bourbon entwined with red malts drier yeast raisin black currant with minor dry earth for the nose very warm bourbon with yeast and some gentle oak prune raisin toasted caramel and red malts feel has sharp yeast with warm booze carry the day malts are the backbone nice balance between the base ale and the barrel though it gets tested more as it warms up
3552,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.11,a 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass delivers a handsome brew a two inch offwhite head rises above a clear redbrown nicely laced ale the smell is pleasant but faint notes of caramel vanilla and cane sugar rise above the bourbon the taste is less reserved with the bourbon front and center over wheat and hops although boozy i find the relative simplicity of the taste refreshing and appealing there are no deep coffee chocolate hops fruit or malt notes here which are the norm in a bourbon barrel aged beer it is clean clear red ale that has been barrel aged and i applaud this uncluttered presentation i enjoyed crimson keep way more than expected and overall crimson keep is a keeper
3553,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.01,first time trying this dragons milk and the first time realizing that dragons milk has become a subbrand anyway this is the yang to the original dragons milks yin where the original is thick and sweet here we have something a bit astringent and sharp both are 11 abv but crimson keep is much more dangerous the original is thick and heavy and hard to drink in quantity while the somewhat lighter crimson keep goes down quick im a big fan of the more bitter ethanol tinged taste of this new offering i recommend it but be careful  pours a cloudy copper red with a nice lacy head the smell is quite sharp and medicinal it has a taste that is also somewhat coppery and a sharp bite thats very nice you definitely need to like a good red ale to appreciate this beer so if you dont like red ale take a pass mouth feel is much thinner than the original which contributes to its danger i really like this
3554,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.52,touch of sweetness from the barrel aging robust and delicious light vanilla and brown sugar touch of molasses all the best flavors from the barrel come through in a sublime way tastes a little like boulevards bba quad  and that is a huge complement wonder if they served this at the red wedding
3555,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4,bottled on 32023  a  crimson garnet dark amber colored pour with thin cream colored foam and light carbonation  s  sweet toasted caramel malt some vanille and bourbon whiskey dominate the nose  t  sweet toasted caramel vanilla some oak and bourbon from start to finish while ending on the sweeter side with lingering bourbon caramel and vanilla  m  big medium body with gentle carbonation and warming on the way down the throat  o  this is a really nice sweet sipper
3556,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.3,another in their dragons milk series a great malty barrel aged red ale very smooth could be dangerous with the high 11 
3557,Old Monk 10000,5,old monk 10000 is a super beer how do you know it says so on the bottle i dont know about you but i havent gotten this far in life by disregarding the advice printed on beer bottles the world is full of hipster ipas but if youre having a spicy indian meal and need something to simultaneously manage the fire in your mouth and get you drunk old monk 10000 super beer is exactly the tool for the job it may also be able to cure stds and cancer too but ill leave that research to professionals i only gave this beer all 5s because giving it 10000 in each category wasnt an option
3558,Old Monk 10000,2.54,poured from a 22oz bottled on february 8th 2022  head is immediately fizzy and not fine retention isnt great but it settles ad a surprisingly thick cap and ring body is a solid but light yellow straw with fine but plentiful carbonation lacing does form nicely but isnt throughout the whole glass  aroma is metallic with enough acetaldehyde to throw wine aromas fruity and dry but for a lager that isnt great not skunky but very yeasty  taste is incredibly light for what it is similar to budweiser ricey but surprisingly clean considering the aroma the acetaldehyde is still present and a bready malt is not present at all  feel is dry and maintains drinkability even as it warms long finish but incredibly dry and attenuated  overall this comes off as a malt liquor for sure the aroma and taste implied the abv but there is no alcohol burn if it wasnt an expensive import it would be a touch better than hurricane malt liquor
3559,Old Monk 10000,3.28,650 ml bottle mfg 10122021 you have to get your malt liquor ticks when opportunity knocks 15 months old at sampling poured into a giant mug at fridge temp 8 abv the beer pours mostly bright light amber with off white head the head recedes to a thin cap but leaves no lacing the aroma is moderate in strength featuring stale dusty grain and vegetable oil the taste is semisweet slick malt with sucrose sweetness orchard fruit and a hint of floral hop minimal bitterness the mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a fairly undry finish overall average malt liquor but not super enjoyable
3560,Old Monk 10000,3.03,sampling a cold 650 ml bottle of this beer poured into a chalice because why not consuming as part of the online malt liquor tasting the beer pours a bright rich clear golden color with a fizzy bleached white head foaming up about 1 cm this foam fades to a thin edge layer and one large island in the center of my glass several lazy streams of carbonation rise to the surface the aroma is fairly mild on this one with a little bit of grain and some general sweetness with a bit of apple cider note and some corn husk but very faint all around may open up as it warms first sip reveals a light to medium body with fine and spacious carbonation texture is a little thin yet slick and does leave a slight coating feel on my lips flavor is briefly grainy malt and then apple juice apple cider and refined sugar the finish is a little bit of white wine or green grape and tarter cider note no hops no booze very easy to drink minus the sweetness and proximal to apple cider character finish is lingering now with that white wine note glad to have tried it for the tasting almost definitely wouldnt buy it again i dont hate this beer but its pretty sweet so know that if you buy one
3561,Old Monk 10000,3.45,straw yellow appearance with a thin white head smell is of grain malt and a little of a dry apple cider character taste is lacking any real character slightly sour but not in a good way though for a malt liquor its drinkable the finish isnt terrible
3562,Old Monk 10000,3.7,old monk 10000 has a fairly thick bright white head and a bubbly hazy strawgold appearance with minimal lacing the aroma is of fermented bready cereal grains the flavor is of a slight white wine or green apple note with very faint hop character old monk 10000 has a highmedium body and a semidry finish  rjt
3563,Old Monk 10000,2.76,l clear honey hue with a finger of stark white foam average retention but no lace  s between a lagers straw aroma and an offdry saison strong apple blossoms  t certainly an abbey ale full cracker and bready malts starts easy to drink but gets a bit forward sweet and medicinal an over the top middle taste that is hard to swallow  f medium body and a bit heavy handed the carbonation is serious but welcome and while the finish is drier midpalate is nearly cloying like a poor cider  o funny looking through the prior review before coming up with my overall thoughts phenolic applescider medicinal seems these are common sentiments while there are well executed elements to the beer it is not repeatable for me
3564,Old Monk 10000,3.32,650 ml bottle batch no  mfg date both blank purchased cold single split poured between a fat tulip and a teku  l crystalclear honeyorangeamber colored liquid tiny bit of dusty sediment afloat tight white bubbly foam holding more steady in the teku lovely spongy collar keeps but littletono lace  s classic cake donut or sugar cookie malt base subtle leather and vague coriander phenol spice similar to what ive smelled in some strong pale baltic lagers notably carlsberg special brew so mildly medicinal but more so almost ciderlike lightmoderate overall intensity  t oh yeah but then no dry vaguely cornmeal cereal overtone soft blast of ethanol through the middle sort of stale floury finish lingering a sec before quietly degrading in the aftertaste after a few moments a vague dry apple pie flavor flickering like a ciderchampagnemalt liquor cocktail flavors have a bit more popfocus outta the teku  f quiet heat lingering back and top of palate rounded mellow bite bottom of palate feels relatively dry and clean marginally ragged around the edges but doesnt have much viscosity or burn  o reminds me of a lighter axe head  tastes a touch aged but also doesnt taste carefully brewed andor made to be sipped cellar temp from a glass do keep the bottle wrapped in the paper bag and this is a race to the finish  on your marks 1581
3565,Old Monk 10000,2.8,so its pretty much a beefier malt liquor im not a hater of malt liquor so i enjoyed it and sitting at 8 percent youll certainly feel it basically imagine malt liquor with more dust and piss and youve got it for real though it wasnt half bad

3567,Yacht,3.84,for my next entry in new more odds n sods beer sunday week 780 i am returning to the delmarva  dc debacle  my old friend stillwater i still have a number of duclaw  some keys before i totally close the book but i was starting to get bogged down to the point of taking a break this seems like a nice add to the canquest tm while helping to reduce the backlog  from the can dryhopped session lager  7 contemporary works by stillwater  works for me i cracked open the vent  becan a slow gentle cline glug into the awaiting glass man did this one ever want to foam up i wound up with twoplus fingers of dense foamy rocky bonewhite head with great retention color was a gorgeous yellowgold srm  4  5 with nequality clarity like liquid sunshine in my glass on an overcast rainy sunday in earlyfebrewary it also caused the gelt gang of mammon midas  croesus to jump up from my couch where they were watching the penscaps pregame on my telly to join me in the kitchen for a taste nose was royally hoppy 8o i was pleasantly surprised even as it caused me to sneeze in response mouthfeel was medium good for a lager of any stripe the taste was quite hoppy  bitter which was fine for me but totally out of whack for the style 8 from this sites style guide the hop character is low and should only balance with no signs of flavor or aroma  for the most part this style has the least amount of flavor than any other style of beer aarrgh i have no choice to mark it down when reviewing to style  in this case it pains me this was as crisp  hoppy as a pilsner really tasty  quite refreshing finish remained crisp dry  hoppy it actually scratched an itch for me but this was no miller litebud lightcoors light i would definitely want this in my beachbound summer cooler ymmv
3568,Yacht,4.02,picked it up for a buck on the weekly run strong citrus smell with a hint of malt behind it taste is crisp with nice carbonation floral with a hoppy finish very nice mouth feel amazingly light and easy to drink but the carbonation and flavor fill the mouth and nose overall surprised by how solid this is as a session lager light enough to throw back a few but wont water you down
3569,Yacht,3.62,excellent light beer malty and a little sweet with decent fizz goes down easy give it a try
3570,Yacht,4.19,a crisp gold in color with rich head and great lacing n grass soapy notes hops and light citrusfloral t follows the nose a crisp lager with excellent notes of grass hops floral and a slight dryness on the finish m light o what a nice lager this was loads of flavor and so easy to drink just a nice clean beer
3571,Yacht,3.72,appearance pours clear and golden colored with a prodigious head good retention and the lacing coats the glass  smell grain grass and sulfur  taste a lot of sulfur on the palate from start to finish grainy and grassy otherwise  mouthfeel light body with moderate to high carbonation  overall rather disappointed by the sulfuric dominance here
3572,Yacht,4.05,pale yellow body thick fluffy white head foam sticking to the sides of the glass light fruity bouquet on the nose melon and strawberries delicate notes of light malts also with a lowkey berrylike fruitiness a little lemony grassy fine hop bitterness light body delicate crisp and refreshing on the palate  this is one fine pilsner lightness in body and delicate in the taste and aroma categories yet delivering some solid flavors throughout there is a deft presence of fruitiness throughout and nicely balanced with a crisp dry hop bitterness a session beer packed with depth and complexity it makes for a fine summer quencher and would be suitable any time of the year when you want flavor and satisfaction but a heavier beer just doesnt fit the bill
3573,Bad Boy,4.68,pours a nice clear golden color with a nice head and lacing aroma has generous floral and hoppy hints the taste follows the nose with a very well balanced floral and hoppy flavors a medium bodied well carbonated beer a great ipa
3574,Bad Boy,4.9,82 hits on all levels
3575,Bad Boy,4.5,from a monthold pint can pours a very clear deep orangegold smell and taste are very herbal and piney with a touch of citrus bracing bitterness but not excessively so a big unapologetic west coast iipa fantastic beer
3576,Slow Pour Pils,4.37,enjoyed this slow pour at the source  time to see what all the hype andor fuss has been about this pours beautifully certainly the creamy tuff of foam atop makes this visually distinct gentle aroma with an underlying spiciness on the sip  its the experience that makes this i didnt get anything to go because i just dont think it would compare
3577,Slow Pour Pils,3.98,golden yellow with large cap of white foam nice malt with a good bite and cracker from the malts crisp
3578,Slow Pour Pils,4.28,16oz can stamped on can bottom is 20522 clear pale gold colored body first pour produces a three finger white head which reduces to a bubbly cap and ring each successive pour results in a one finger head which stays around a bit leaves behind strings and spots of lacing aroma of toasty malts that smells of bread and biscuit products and herbalgrassy hops taste is sweet bready malt with some spicy hops that express herbal and grassy slight mineral note at the end all tail off in the aftertaste fuller mouth feel with carbonated bubbles dry finish crisp finish excellent carbonation crisp and clean sweeter pilsner with a very good balance of malts and hops
3579,Slow Pour Pils,4.17,the presentation was classica tall thin cylinder pilsner glass filled with liquid of the brightest gold with a thin purewhite cap as refreshing as this beer looks in the glass it is twice as crisp going down snappy crisp bread and biscuit flavor with that authentically german dab bite bierstadt should be proud of this onehighly recommended
3580,Slow Pour Pils,4.37,at the bierstadt this was memorable served in a narrow pokal the head is like nothing ive ever seen  kind of hardshaped foam that sticks around for ever and leaves some nice lacing the nose is pilsner malt  fresh and bready  and the noble hops are solid but not aggressive taste wow this is incredibly smooth and soft like pillowy a little hoppy edge but no bite and it doesnt dry out either guess that tells me that im used to amped up and more aggressively hopped americanstyle pils well this one isnt in your face at all but it has some great depth of flavor theres a little mineral quality in there too which i wasnt expecting construction of this beer is top notch
3581,Slow Pour Pils,3.89,had on tap at the brewery with the true slow pour  on arrival to the tablet he head was almost stylized looking like soft serve ice cream above the rim of the glass the body is a clear golden straw with quite active carbonation some nice lacing is formed  aroma is decent lots of fermentation character backed by earthy noble hops some malts are detectable but they are quite light compared to everything else going on  taste is nicer than the aroma with a nice noble hop bite and some lingering bitterness without becoming a hoppy lager a crackery malt shines through in the flavor quite nicely spicy light and malty a true traditional pils with just a little extra bitterness  feel on the slow pour is beautiful i could see myself drinking this as a great refresher too bad id have to come to the brewery to truly experience it creamy head up top with a body that carries a good carbonation bite some good contrast extremely drinkable even with coming here on the last stop of a brewery hop the first glass was gone quick  overall this is a very traditional german pils brewed here in denver flavor is spicy and malty with a good bitterness and the slow pour at the brewery is very nice even if you gotta wait for it
3582,Pre-War Pils,4.29,070623 on bottom of can and on 6pack holder poured into a samuel adams perfect pint  a very clear light honey yellow with 1finger foamy white head with decent retention and scrappy lacing  s great adjunct lager aroma with excellent balance of pils malt corn and lightly herbal and spicy hopping  t flavor is also exceptionally wellbalanced with delicious slightly sweet bread malt flavors enhanced by the sweeter corn and lightly spicy hopping clean with no esters or offflavors bitterness is lowmedium  m drinkable almost to the point that i wish it was a little more hefty for prepro lager style but spritzy carbonation and dry finish make for a stellar feel experience  o exceptional adjunct lager in every area
3583,Pre-War Pils,3.83,can from uptown market side by side with the regular pils  a clear straw yellow lighter than the pilz the nose is clean snappy crisp with a touch of corn minimal hops minimal fermentation character unlike the pilz straw the palate is clean crisp snappy but ultimately lacking in character when paired against a real pils snappy clean finish a hair watery solid
3584,Pre-War Pils,4.5,absolutely world class beverage  theres a reason it has the rating it does which should be higher in my opinionslightly sweet good corn presencesuper delicious  just the perfect blend of grain and hops one of those beers i would take to a deserted island and be ok with from now on  highly recommended if you see it
3585,Pre-War Pils,4.08,another 6 pack pick up across from the airport so this is the best adjunct lager in the world you know sips booze i dont disagree lets do this  pours a clear golden color super familiar as beer 23 white head as virgin as any comic book movie craft beer crowd can get the aroma hits those golden waves of grain crossed up with a little bit of corn hops are fuggle floral like and largely chilled out not trying to be an ipa or anything called hoppy i like it  the taste hits a stronger than expected yeast note but still sits second chair to the evocative golden waves of grain reference were only making plans of nigel he hasnt committed to any of them the carbonation is brisk and totally suited to this corny beer its light and crushable yet delivers grains by the truckload this beer makes me wish it was warm all the time not really but man i enjoy drilling these way more than some quadruple barrel 35 bottle production you split 8 ways  this brewery makes so many good pilsners ive lost count i think i like the polish one the most
3586,Pre-War Pils,4.45,from a can packaged 122722 clear golden color with a thin layer of white bubbles smells of grain light body with prickly carbonation toasted malt up front with some lemon and floral hops on the finish ok this is a really well executed beer that has earned its 1 in the aal style
3587,Pre-War Pils,4.25,crisp clear eversoslightly sweet refreshing i love this not fancy but excellent beer live oak beers are so crushable no worries about a headache later on the lighter side without being at all watery i love the pilz and this is right there with it but slightly lighter and slightly sweeter
3588,Pre-War Pils,4.74,picked up a six pack dated 051222  pours a crystal clear pale golden in color with hints of copper a decent amount of head on the pour dissipates to a thin lacing rather quickly some of which clings to the glass as you drink carbonation looks average to maybe a tick above pretty standard look for an adjunct perhaps with a bit deeper hue and more lacing than usual a bit more head retention would be nice but not expected from the style  aroma is pretty straightforward sweet corn buttery grains and lemony hops i like where this is headed i cant think of a better smelling adjunct off the top of my head  taste follows the aroma well predominantly sweet corn and buttery grains with some crackery notes but balanced nicely with ample hoppiness mostly lemon zest very clean taste with no offnotes or funk finishes a tad crisp but not overly dry with lingering butter and lemon zest on the tongue  mouthfeel is actually on the lighter side of medium bodied much more substance than i am used to in the style carbonation is lively but not quite zesty a lot of brews in this category come off a bit seltzery but i am happy to report this one does not there is actually some chewiness here almost unheard of for the style drinks very smooth highly sessionable  okay im impressed this is far and away the best brew ive had in this category and i think i like this even better than the live oak pilz which i regard very highly this brewery clearly knows what they are doing with lager brews dare i say they might be the finest lager brewer in the country this could easily become a fridge beer especially in the hot summer months here in austin adding this one to my list for future beer purchases when im in the mood for something a bit more on the lighter side cheers
3589,Pre-War Pils,3.94,poured from a can into a pint glass pours golden yellow with a small white head smells of sweet grain very much better than most pilsners tastes of sweet grain with nice fruit notes beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation overall a very good beer
3590,Hurricane High Gravity,3.75,relatively smooth and easy to drink at first but quite onedimensional i didnt really want to finish the can but did it anyways
3591,Hurricane High Gravity,3.16,if you like strong beer this is good on a hot day it needs to be served cold  around 36 degrees taste is almost lager or pilsner but much stronger i doubt it has much barley malt in it but still tastes like beer be careful  this has enough alcohol to be dangerous and the price is always right
3592,Hurricane High Gravity,2.96,on the nose its a bit like malt vinegar and homeless people urine like if you walk around a city and encounter random piss stench  taste takes you similar places  i almost never spew but this stuff is a bit hard to get down  i can drink whiskey all night but this had me wanting a nap after my first pint  edit this was my warm review picked up a florida six pack on my way to the gym at the dollar store  will try this chilled a little later on  ok chilled update  2 pints down cracking my third  not bad
3593,Hurricane High Gravity,3.68,this is my goto beer because its cheap but it doesnt taste like cheap beer or water any brewer home or otherwise will tell a casual beer lover that higher gravity means a higher grain bill malt and usually more yeast to consume that higher sugar content higher grain bill means more flavor among abinbevs usual offerings not including crafts like wicked weed here in asheville this is the best lager it beats the hell out of budweiser you dont have to drink as many to sleep well and its cheaper than any other beer at my local stores good value for the price yes i like crafts like new belgiums voodoo ranger imperial ipa also produced here in asheville but hurricane is about 8 for 12 craft beers are at least twice as much it puts me to sleep without a lot of tossing and turning and thats why i drink beer at night
3594,Hurricane High Gravity,2,had that one time at a party back in the day i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included today at 0616 pm edit delete
3595,Hurricane High Gravity,3.12,this is the best cheap beer hands down for a few reasons number one is the taste when i was a heavy drinker i would buy pitbulls earthquakes and natty daddys if it was a particularly rough week id have to drink camo all those drinks have a terrible sour taste to them that makes you cringe after a swig the only reason you want to get drunk is to hide the same your feeling hurricane actually tastes fine as long as its really cold it doesnt have that sour and sickly aftertaste at all as long as its cold number 2 is the strength 8 is lower than a heavy ipa but its way better than a light beer it gets you drunk after a rough week 2 or 3 if you dont have to wake up early the next day of these will relax you quite a bit the drunk is good too unlike some of the super cheap paint thinner cans you can buy thats really all you need to know the look and feel of this beer arent important its the price the abv and the drunkeness enjoy
3596,Hurricane High Gravity,2.43,poured from an undated 25oz can into a pils glass  on the pour i am honestly surprised by a 2 finger fine head the body has lively carbonation as expected is a dark straw to gold crystal clear and is crystal clear the head recedes to a decent covering and remains relatively fine some lacing is left  aroma on the other hand is as expected for a high gravity lager smells kind of like sweat fermented green apple off notes along with skunk which i guess implies some sort of hopping an alcoholic note resides at the back along with a vague note of malt overall it just smells like yeast that was treated like an alcohol producing slave and worked way past its useful limits with low quality hops and a malt bill thats been watered down with adjuncts likely rice or corn syrup  flavor is quite similar to the aroma with some harsh out of place esters and a hard to explain tartness behind that a surprising amount of hop bitterness creeps in likely to cover up dirty fermentation notes alcohol is detectable and the only positive to that is that eventually the burning and inebriation covers more and more off notes making what malt is present on the finish more and more noticeable as you drink which is about the only redeeming factor once you actually start drinking  feel is at first light any other full flavor aal but the co2 bit is quite high and the finish is quite dry but surprisingly drawn out despite the general thinness on the palate not the worst but not the best pretty average but it keeps it drinkable  overall it could be worse but this isnt a very high quality beer it will get you drunk its cheap and its not the worst thing thats passed my lips
3597,Hurricane High Gravity,3.63,i find that instead of acquiring a taste for expensive craft beers its better to acquire a taste for cheap high gravity beers its a lot cheaper and the money you save can be used for cheeseburgers this beer fits the bill it tastes better than steel reserve while that isnt saying much its not bad and you get a lot of bang for the buck im not going to pretend that i only drink for the taste i like to get a buzz going this one does it very effectively
3598,Hurricane High Gravity,3,from a 25oz can  appearance clear gold big head  smell sweet boozy  taste sweet fruityapples  grapes little bit of corn underneath boozy no weird aftertaste  overall traveling for work must pick up a beer or three but the beer selection is not great in this smaller city so lets try a malt liquor hurricane high gravity is not bad sure its not my first or fifteenth choice but its got decent flavor and no real ugliness that you can get with many high gravity malt liquors
3599,Hurricane High Gravity,2.39,you ever felt down on your luck or had a really hard day at work and was thirsty look no further then your local gas station dive bar or local beer store and pickup a tallboy size or if offered 40oz of hurricane why did anheuser busch name it hurricane well it depends on the batch brewed but your bound to have a hurricane effect either emotionally physically or psychologically from drinking it ill leave the graphic effects out  nevertheless it is on par with its other contenders for pour taste smell and overall quality which is in a class of its own its not terrible by any means if consumed ice cold and drank fast before it changes internal temperatures fast it is worth every penny if your looking to get drunk fast and you have a few bucks in your pocket this is the go to malt liquor if you have a few more bucks do yourself a favor a look to the cabinet where a tall boy or 40oz is about a dollar more youll thank yourself later
3600,Hurricane High Gravity,4.17,honestly a solid product doesnt taste bad as long as its ice cold the price is right when im broke and the reactions i get at parties when drinking these is priceless usually 1 or 2 people try it and end up changing their mind haha far from a bum drink if you ask me
3601,Hurricane High Gravity,3.16,light gold body clear lively carbonation thick white head dense and foamy very faint aroma just touch of graininess respectable flavor grainy sweet and bitter with a fairly prominent alcohol presence phenol suggestion mediumheavy body some sticky residual sugar notes somewhat dry with a strong alcohol effect  a basic american malt liquor it hits the abv style squarely has great looks but little distinctive smell and the taste while not bad doesnt lend itself to repeat visits  poured at 42 f canning data on bottom of the can 21269
3602,1554,3.67,poured from a 12oz bottle into a frosted pint glass at oscars bar  grille in limon co  appearance dark brown with a massive light tan head that lasted long and left abundant lacing  nose rich roast bread  mouthfeel light  attack sort of follows the nose adding bitter roast a bit too quickly i was hoping for a little more depth in the flavor  finish continues and resolves the bitterness with some hops  overall the look and the nose set me up for higher expectations its drinkable but wont go down as my favorite
3603,1554,4.92,in a nut shellgreat beetr
3604,1554,3.9,thanksgiving at johns
3605,Appervation,4.5,375ml bottle at shareblack pour ring of brown head aroma is roasty malts coffee chocolate taste is roasty and bitter mildly sweet chcocolate and a healthy dose of abv
3606,Appervation,4.54,on draft at jackie os on 4th in columbus  nice rich chocolate flavor  wish they hadnt been serving this so cold but it was far better as it warmed black with a slight brown head  great barrel but very balanced  you can taste the sp influence in this beer chewy finish very very solid ba stout
3607,Skol Beer,4,i am trying to get myself as close to a milestone before tomorrow evening as possible so i am running through as much of the backlog to position myself to be able to meet it as possible as such the canquest tm is going to be hitting some oddballs  from the can european brewing tradition  premium quality beer imported one of the top 5 selling beers in the world source canadean  i kind of liked that this is a simple epl it gave me the chance to simply canduct a quick  simple crack  glug resulting in the formation of just under two fingers of dense foamy rocky bonewhite head with admirable retention in the face of tonights heat  humidity color was yellowgold srm  4  5 with nequality clarity bringing the gelt gang of midas mammon  croesus in from the living room where they were watching tonights pgh pirates black  gold game on teevee nose was malty sweet but very clean  quite simply a lager i prefer this style over aals any day of the week at any time mouthfeel was medium big for the style the taste was quite malty  sweet more bready than malty but still a refreshing drink on a hot humid summers night i have baseball on the telly  this would be a welcome alternative to drinking an aal at the ballpark finish was semisweet just sweet enough for my taste this was not a bad beer ymmv
3608,Skol Beer,2.18,got this in malaysia 320ml can poured into a pint glass  l clear gold in color with decent white head and average retention there is some lacing left behind  s metallic sulfur grain dms grass  t metallic sulfur grain dms grass a bit yeasty sour quite insipid  fo light body moderate crisp and carbonation not that smooth semidry finish better no repeat
3609,Skol Beer,1.69,320ml can from 7eleven in malaysia rm750 light and incredibly clear golden straw coloured with a thin half centimetre head that is bubbly but at least it manages to hold for a little while barely budging at all over the first few minutes  sweet with a lot of corn and grain plus a little bit of alcohol and plenty of skunk coming through there is a sort of metallic smell initially as well but the beer smells quite cheap on the nose  bland tasting at first with a sort of sweet carbonated water taste and some mild bitterness and some skunky flavours as well there is some faint grassy hops and a little corn with some cheap lager malts as well  grainy  light bodied with a skunky flavour throughout but nothing overpowering at least there is a clean but very bland mouthfeel and the finish has touches of bitterness and is dry too  a very poor effort and if im honest it was pretty much what i had been expecting from this one not one i can recommend and i cant imagine the beer is any good no matter where it is brewed around the world
3610,Munzler's Vienna Lager,5,beautiful sure to delight any lager fan earthy toasted brown bread with a crisp minerality could have 6 of these easily
3611,Munzler's Vienna Lager,4.25,appearance pours a slightly hazy golden tinged amber color with a two finger head excellent retention that leaves speckles of lace  smell toasted bread earthy tones and vienna malt sweet but just shy of caramel  taste vienna malt flavors forward with earthy toasted bread tones tempering a bit grassy through the middle to add some bitterness but the vienna malt is the star here  mouthfeel medium body with moderate carbonation  overall olde meck does a great job with this brew truly befits the style
3612,Munzler's Vienna Lager,4.3,it is one of the easiest most sessionable vienna lagers ive had not too sweet nor too much caramel its really subtle in flavors and finishes crisp and refreshing a good lager option
3613,Munzler's Vienna Lager,4.43,on tap at the brewery clear copper color three fingers fine white head full lacing curtains roast malt floral bready aromas sweet caramel pear light floral and roast malt flavors smooth light mouthfeel outstanding carbonation i will join the high ratings an outstanding vienna lager one of the best omb beers
3614,Munzler's Vienna Lager,4.78,poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass a 2 sudsy off white head drops quickly abundant carbonation in amber colored liquid rich malty aroma mouthfeel is fairly light with a dry finish flavors of caramel toasted malt raisin and some citrus hops in the finish overall extremely good
3615,Munzler's Vienna Lager,4.65,poured from a 12 oz bottle into an olde meck tall mug  the beer pours a clear deep copper color with ruby highlights and 3 fingers worth of offwhite head that slowly recedes to a small cap  the aroma is bready toasted malts caramel and just a hint of floral hops very clean and inviting  the taste is much like the aroma bready and toasty with some sweet caramel notes and just enough hop presence to balance the beer out quite delicious  mediumlight mouthfeel with moderate carbonation  overall this is a phenomenal beer probably my favorite example of the style so far
3616,Munzler's Vienna Lager,5,on draft deep copper colored no head smell is sweet malts flavor is also malty sweet and amazing this is by far the best vienna lager ive ever had so it gets a 5 across the board from me
3617,Munzler's Vienna Lager,4.5,the olde mecklenburg brewery does it again i would swear i was actually in germany drinking this very authentic vienna lager crisp and piney i am not good at picking out raisins plums wood chips or iron filings but i can you from experience this is the bomb
3618,Munzler's Vienna Lager,3.92,12 oz bottle poured into a long tulip glass a clear orangebrown with ruby highlights and a one finger white head that retains nicely the aroma is toasted grains and floral hop notes the taste is right in line mouthfeel is light carbonation medium a well made straightforward vienna
3619,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",4.19,pours a deep dark brown color with a finger of tan head the nose has notes of milk chocolate syrup and the chocolate notes carry over in the flavor  this is a fine effort but compared to other th milk stouts in the same abv range it is incredibly average
3620,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",4.5,16 oz can stamped summer 2023 drank 7723  look dark with tan head  smell  sweet milk chocolate and vanilla  taste  dark roasty and malty with a slightly burnt coffee finish not nearly as sweet as it smells in a good way coffee finish  feel  not thick not thin creamy mouthfeel  overall  quite enjoyable expected it to be much sweeter like most treehouse milk stouts but this one was not overly sweet and very drinkable

3623,Wee Heavy,4.35,2022 bought for 13 at alesmiths brewery in san diego ca for a beer tasting with my buddy ron just a few quick notes because during these tastings i dont spend too much time writing  as not much head on this one brown black colored beer the aroma is sweet with hints of oranges  tm very easy to drink the taste is peet black licorice and butterfingers medium mouthfeel and carbonation  overall i would recommend it
3624,Wee Heavy,3.97,a 1 pint 94 fl oz foiled and capped bottle with no clear bottled on or best before date poured into a snifter glass  appearance a cloudy amber copper orange colour with very thin beige head that dissipated quickly while leaving some lacing  aroma dark fruit prunes caramel toffee booze with a light roast and a hint of chocolate  taste sweet malt light roast caramel toffee dark fruit prunes brown sugar with light notes of chocolate  mouthfeel medium to full bodied with light to moderate carbonation  overall a nice sipper with good flavours
3625,Wee Heavy,3.68,750 ml bottle kindly shared by abemorsten abv is 10 very dark ruby colour nearly black low beige head aroma of malts dark dried fruits  prunes and caramel maybe a hint of smoke very rich and malty flavour again with caramel and prunes and maybe a hint of smoke powerful stuff
3626,Wee Heavy,4.19,look  dark brown muddy color with a slight film rim smell  sweet caramel booze with some fig taste  a lot like the scent feel  a lot of body light carbonarion overall  great tasty beer a lot like a barley wine
3627,Wee Heavy,3.67,had this when i was visiting the old brewery pours a dark mahogany and chestnut brown almost leaning into black territory were talking  looks similar to an imperial porter at this point tan colored head 35 good retention solid looking beer the aroma is a mixture of earthy malt toffee bitterness booziness and mild smoked caramel sweetness  taste is chewy but not thick more of that brown and smoked malt in a minor way not rauchbier levels aspect mingles some dark fruit like influence mouth feel then gives more nuanced complexity in that you start getting more of a nuttiness angle to compliment all the other stuff moderate heat which means at a double digit abv it hides the alcohol decently thinner body than the appearance and taste would seem to indicate normally carbonation on point this seems like a good candidate for an evening around a fire especially campfires
3628,Wee Heavy,4.35,probably my favorite wee heavy perfectly balanced nice and boozy just the right amount of sweetness and not overly malty this is one of my gotos when visiting alesmith and it remains a menu standard because of its consistently worldclass brewing good stuff
3629,Faxe Extra Strong,3.11,500 ml can from the lcbo dated may 23 2022 and best before aug 21 2023 served well chilled this is review 3000 so i had no choice but to go with the biggest doozie i could find  pours a clear honey gold colour crowned with nearly two fingers of frothy foamy white head that dissipates within three minutes or so a snaking band of delicate lace is left behind in addition to a soapy collar surrounding some filmy wisps on the surface  looks safe enough it smells of alcohol corn syrup green apple skin and barley malts with faint hints of acetone banana chips and pears not great but not entirely objectionable  i gotta say i am a little impressed at how tolerable this is corn husk honey sweetness and lots of grainy barley malt as well as a relatively lowkey booziness that is everpresent throughout the sip fruity hints of apple and white grape crop up briefly but dont last the finish is cornysweet and boozy with grassy dirty hops echoing into a malty boozy aftertaste mostly lacking the fusel nastiness you get with really bad examples of this style but it does numb the tongue a little mediumlight in body with low carbonation and a light airy texture juxtapositioned with a slick clingy mouthfeel im not 20 anymore but if i were thisd make a good predrink before hitting the bar or club or whatever  final grade 311 a passable c every thousandth review i pick out a dud  ie an arguably crummy beer that i have avoided reviewing previously im not going to pretend that finishing this can of faxe extra strong wasnt a chore but truthfully this is not even close to the worst strong euro lager ive stumbled across i think its one of the better ones  id easily take this over any of those bavaria 86 beers and it blows all of the other 10 euro lagers ive tried out of the water realistically i have no excuse to ever drink this again and their fest bock is a much better beer but extra strong still earns my tacit grudging approval plus a recommendation as a respectable example of its style
3630,Faxe Extra Strong,3,poured a 500ml can into a pint glass a one finger bubbly white head on a clear pale amber good head retention and lacing light malt smells corn very mild hop finish moderate body and carbonation better than i expected
3631,Faxe Extra Strong,3.87,1 liter can 07apr20 purchased cold single 2 days ago from beer world liberty ny sipped on soon after over the course of 2 mobile hours pouring little by little into my new genesee 9 oz tasting glass review cobbled from recollections of that journey  10 quality lager beer black can redgoldwhite branding different label than whats pictured here slightly hazy decomposing amber liquid ample foam build with each pour and it actually collared and laced a bit on the nose fuselkissed medicinal spice barmy yeast artificial fruit aroma undertones on the palate wells banana bread beer nuttiness enhanced dried out and fortifiedtainted with cheap rotgut ethanol textures brief round swell up front dropping clean in the finish aside from a mild oily warmth but no burn delicate tickle from the aforementioned spicenut elements mild effervescence  summary almost 12 years to the day i finally found another beer with a nearly identical flavor profile to that of the carlsberg special brew i had at the prince of wales pub in aberdeen scotland blown away memories reminiscence flashbacks flooded my mind that said this isnt a spectacular swill but id love to try a fresh can though its remarkably drinkable because dang i did end up finishing the whole can somehow pacing and experienced no recoil from beginning to end i guess it was worth the detour 1800
3632,Faxe Extra Strong,4.2,faux 10 ultra strong beer or as me and my compatriate have affectionately renamed it beans the stylish can reimagines the can as a can of beans and leans more to the experience as the physical attributes of the beer itself beans can turn your bad evening into a great one very quick although the taste leaves some to be desired this can be fixed by drinking beans out of the can which adds to the feeling that beans can give you which is rarely a tactic i have seen from my fellow beans drinkers i urge everyone to forget about the taste of beans and to focus on how your day brightens after consumption beans can change your life give beans the respect it deserves  yours truly the beans brothers
3633,Faxe Extra Strong,2.06,cloudy golden with a huge white head with decent lacing this was the highlight of the beer aromas of nail polish remover super sweet fruits especially pear and lemon and boozy grains taste is so so so sweet like wow with booze to clash and amplify esters are too nuanced to describe the sweet fruit with some metal on the backend a complete mess feel is boozy resinous sickly sweet and sticky almost gummy not worth your time
3634,Faxe Extra Strong,2.02,i just hope denmark has anything better to offer this is just 10 alcohol good for getting drunk quick and easy but if you want to taste a good lager look somewhere else
3635,Faxe Extra Strong,2.85,also known as faxe 10 shared 1 liter can from vinmonopolet nettbutikken pale golden colour moderate white head moderate sweetish aroma slightly fruity a hint of hops  better than feared very sweet flavour warming mouthfeel some hops in the finish could have been worse
3636,Faxe Extra Strong,3,canned in a behemoth of a full litre can and served as per steve from beer nouveaus instructions for spesh pours a crystal clear golden body with decent enough white head aroma is pear drops some of that pear drop flavour is there not as bad as i thought it would be
3637,Faxe Extra Strong,2.61,tastes like ass but gets the job done
3638,Faxe Extra Strong,2.73,look crystal clear gold one finger of fizzy white head with poor retention  smell sweet adjunct malt with a slight skunk and yeast note  taste sweet malt with an acidic slightly bitter metallic taste  mouthfeel full creamy body with high carbonation  overall pretty bad guys
3639,Faxe Extra Strong,1.92,this iswhew that one word could pretty much sum up the whole experience i used to praise euro strong lagers for doing what american malt liquor brands never could but this i dont know what they were thinking with this the smell is akin to the most alcoholforward malt liquors chemical the taste retains that cleanliness found in euro strong lagers compared to their american cousins but it is just too much alcohol i cannot stress this enough it goes down hot they were nice enough to add in a seemingly random helping of hops and a touch of sweetness but none of the rough attempts at balancing ive had in british offerings of the same style this is just random ingredients mixed together with maximum alcohol being the only attempt making this is itself absurd importing it to the united states where i am attempting to enjoy it now is just another level why
3640,Faxe Extra Strong,2.71,this will knock you back on smell alone it has a deepness to it it does loose its luster as you go because of how strong it is  taste rating in words its putting a ladder on scaffolding on a picnic table in a truck bed just why
3641,Bergenbier,2.29,premium pils it seems all pils are premium in every single country in the world  very bubbly headquite shiny yellow colour  refreshing light airy hoppy aroma typical of a budget pilsner  not too sweet and quite refreshing very well balanced totally fine for a hot day when you just want something refreshing and lightly hoppy when you are chilling in the sun light german style hops with a hint of czech very light malt flavour coming through  mouth feel is quite watery and tingly  obviously this doesnt have the complexity of a west coast ipa from the west coast however as a budget pilsner its perfect extra overall marks as its great value
3642,Bergenbier,3,10 agosto 2020 de carrefour en copa hefe de bavaria tras partido de futbito y cena pues no s√© si ser√° el calor tras jugar partido pero me la he fulminado en 01 y me ha parecido que ten√≠a un perfil maltoso muy agradable ni aguado ni demasiado denso ideal para beber a grandes tragos y con una buena combinaci√≥n de dulzor y amargor avg 40  28 marzo 2022 en copa de pinta inglesa de ikea estudiando se bebe sin problemas y presenta ciertas notas agradables aunque nada que merezca la excesiva calificaci√≥n que le di la otra vez simplemente ok avg 3
3643,Bergenbier,2.33,they call this one a friendship maker probably because when drunk you need to lean on someone
3644,Bergenbier,2.95,bottled pours a clear light golden yellow colour with a absolute minimum head nickel coins and semolina aroma slight tang makes a slightly above average pils
3645,Bergenbier,2.89,very fresh and citrusy tastey though
3646,Bergenbier,2,robust head the smell has nothing characteristic a little yeast sour taste bitterness weak and thats it nothing fancy i see no reason to come back to it
3647,Bergenbier,3.5,typical pale lager colour great lacing  mild aroma of grain  taste is grainy and pleasantly well balanced with mild hop finish very drinkable but with a very understated flavour  overall a perfectly acceptable clean tasting lager with no off notes but slightly bland  71100
3648,Clasica,2.81,440 ml bottle as mahou cl√°sica original from super cor la manga abv is 48 golden colour pearly carbonation moderate white head sweetish aroma both malts and hops are noticeable could be worse soft carbonation in the mouth the flavour has also noticeable malts the hops are moderate but for a spanish industrial lager this is not too bad at all  earlier rating 9112011 total score 18 330 ml can from super cor la manga abv is 48 golden colour low head the aroma has some malts otherwise it is industrial and uninteresting the flavour is maltier than the aliada tipo pilsen which was displayed side by side and there are some hops in the finish  unfortunately the bitterness is metallic and unpleasant
3649,Clasica,3.48,on draft this really is a league better than its ratings and for me one of the better straight up lagers we had around spain of which we had a fair few neat how every little region seemed to have its own as we traveled through i love the world of international yellow beer this one seems cleaner than most super light bodied and kind of minimal sure but sometimes these are about what they arent not what they are and this isnt metallic oxidized cheap tasting adjunct heavy or sweet so its already ahead of many of its peers it has a nice crispness even if the lager yeast has very little aroma or flavor and there is balance even if nobody would ever describe this as hoppy i have grown to really appreciate freshness in these too and being close enough to the source for that to be the case was a treat context can also be everything we had this beachside on the mediterranean coast with some incredible seafood red mussels spicy shrimp it was primo so something yellow and cold and bubbly and non offensive was just right i preferred this to a lot of others because of its tidiness and refreshment value neat mineral profile makes it kind of earthy its very dry and it has some intangibles like head retention that a lot of these done a pleasing pour had a couple of them stands up well to salinity in food and also to spice better than it gets credit for here on ba
3650,Clasica,2.2,bought at a bar in langreo asturias from tap pale looking no foam head very few smell pilsner taste but low carbonation felt  back to spanish reality from czech republic
3651,Clasica,2.58,330 ml bottle pours golden with fluffy white head and lively carbonation aroma is of grassy hops and grain body is medium and crisp taste is of grain and some hops finish is medium and dry ok on hot day
3652,Clasica,2.41,pale straw color with thick lace beyond that nondescript light beer
3653,Clasica,1.79,cerveza de cuerpo ligero y carbonataci√≥n media aroma a malta y poco m√°s en boca se siente la malta adem√°s de l√∫pulo y una pizca de caramelo acuosa ligeramente amarga con un final extremadamente seco
3654,Clasica,2.4,Ïπ¥Ïä§Îã§ Ïπ¥Ïä§
3655,Lunch,4.43,bottle pour beyond the recommended 90day freshness date but opaque golden yellow color with white foam lemon and grapefruit flavors with a hint of cinnamongraham cracker in the malt base a delicious ipa

3659,Lunch,4.35,bottled 61323 so under 60 days old  l pours a hazy amberorange into a teku foamy white head that leaves light lacing  s pine orange grapefruit with big tropical notes as well  t grapefruit pith and pine resin with an appropriate caramel malt backbone perfectly balanced  f medium bodied with above average carbonation resiny finish  o i tried this a year ago and liked it but didnt understand the hype much better the second time around the west and east coast elements balance each other out to make a delicious brew the only reason i dont see myself buying this all the time is the format 16oz glass bottle 12 oz cans please
3660,Lunch,4.06,bought from a whole foods in munster in the bottled date says april 23 2023 putting it right on the edge of the freshness date but i was curious poured from the 1 pint 9 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass the beer is a pure orange color topped with a foamy off white head that leaves chunky lacing on the glass some sediment within  smell a great balanced refreshing smell citrus and floral grapefruit and honey caramel malt sweet but in a tropical way not sugary some pine balances things out nice  taste citrus rind and some resin balanced by a slight honey sweetness and caramel malt bright throughout finishes surprisingly balanced and clean slight pine remains  overall super refreshing and drinkable i would pick this out again with no hesitation i really want to try this again when fresher as i feel like some of the character has already mellowed out a bit but still tasty
3661,Lunch,4.38,lol this is a top wcipa  from maine pours lusty deep golden nectar with a thick and remaining head aroma includes citrus pith and pine tastes fruity piney sticky with a bit of malt back smack in mouth legendary ipa and yea i own a mbc glass super tasty and top notch

3663,Lunch,4.52,a great beer well balanced in wc style poured into a pub glass at portsmouth book and bar a light amber with a moderate head of golden tan color the rich hops bitterness and profile lingers on the palate
3664,Lunch,4.46,500 ml bottle into a stemmed pint glass  man i love these wchazy hybrids when done right toppling goliath 3fs come to mind some of my favorite breweries out here in socal just left some of their coveted wc styles unfiltered which were tasty in themselves but not quite the same as this and modern times kind of cut their teeth on the style but their ipas have gotten redundant imo  anyway this beer is a knockoutcrisp and citrusy with a subtly juicy finish id say if you didnt look at it youd guess its more of a west coast style with that grassypiney thing going on but its definitely unfiltered and hazy in appearance
3665,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),4.04,sweet malty not much hop taste much better than i thought it would be
3666,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),4.54,i got the canned version and didnt know anything about this beer it was such a pleasant mouthful taste and overall experience to drink its smooth with light carbonation feel it tastes malty and not too sweet when i think of good beer this is what i envision and look for
3667,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),1.7,poured into a pint glass from a 24 oz can looks like typical mass produced brew not bad and managed to leave a smidgen of lacing reality hits you in the face once ya take a few sips no depth just a sugary mess that coated the roof of my mouth with a taste and sensation that not even ai can identify brought back bad memories of hangovers from early college days drain pour
3668,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),2.34,look medium dark orange with a fluffy white head  smell lights barley notes give way to sweet booziness its almost sickly sweet  taste overly sweet with a touch of malt  feel thicker bodied than a standard lager  overall i wouldnt recommend
3669,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),3.58,rated for style 81 malt liquor its february 11th 211 2023 drank from a 24 oz can in a trailer park look i honestly dont remember i always drink it from a can 24oz smell nothing offensive cant smell much probably because im drinking from a can taste like a typical aal with a sweet aftertaste for an 81 very good feel not much carbonation goes down smooth overall this is designed to give one a buzz quickly and is well suited to this task
3670,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),2.65,poured from a 24oz can  on the pour a finger of acceptable fizzy white head formed on top of a clear deep gold body after 5 or less minutes there was zero head retention and it ends up looking like a glass of piss  aroma is of stale 6row covered by a big fruity mistreated yeast ester or phenol thing not stinky like some of these hg malt liquors but not a pleasant lager aroma  taste is an improvement on the aroma at first sip it comes off as a bit bitter from hop extract and too many esters but the more you drink a soft still stale graininess comes through for a decently good for hg finish  feel is dangerous for the abv surprisingly easy drinking and smooth after the initial shock to the system i can put down a pint of this just as fast as a lower gravity malt liquor or even an mhl medium malty finish that is surprisingly pleasant  overall this was a bit of a pleasant surprise after anhueser buschs hurricane i just assumed all hg malt liquors were undrinkable swill but this one has detectable grain and vague hop bitterness making this one of the better ive had
3671,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),2,shitty i guess but good you know like your moms backside  update 823 i am changing grade from 3 to 2 i dont remember what it taste like but i like pbr better now shout it from the hilltops
3672,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),2.5,now i may be biased in my enjoyment of natty daddys but as a person who only drinks diet soda never regular accidentally getting these as a replacement to natty daddys as my cheap high abv drink of choice they are cloyingly sweet almost undrinkable to me i agree i may be obviously biased and while i huge opponent to ipas and other bitter beers a sweetness like this is not agreeable to my palate hands down
3673,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),4.35,i made this account to rate this beer amazing
3674,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),5,love this beer i am 76 years old and have been drinking beer for 58 years this beer is the best i have had fantastic
3675,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),5,it is not often i find a beer that i just love but this is one of a handful i tend to enjoy beer that is not too bitter this is very smooth just the right amount of body not fruity but not too earthy overall i really love this beer
3676,Raspberry,4.23,on tap at the source  a  big deep raspberry colored pour with big pink dense creamy lacing  s  big pasty sticky twangy raspberry jam on the nose  t  follows the nose with a big twangy raspberry jam with some puckering character and a lingering twangy raspberry jasmynness on the back side  m  medium body and slight puckering  o  this is nicy done
3677,Raspberry,4.32,nose is a huge pile of fresh raspberries pallet is fresh raspberries with squeezed lemmon it is a fair bit sour and tart but also with a touch of sweet too feel is sour and light to medium bodied its delicious
3678,Raspberry,3.75,bottle from 2008  pours clear copper with a ruby hue zero head or retention funky in the nose with raspberries a bit cheesy light bodied with a slickish mouthfeel raspberries on the palate with a mild acidity finishes tart
3679,Raspberry,3.62,so much of what the black rim nerd glass contingent in craft beer thinks is just not true the story behind this beer will get around to explaining anyhoo 10 years in the cellar you decide to break it out during a softball game because youre the whitest barely hispanic on your overwhelmingly brown latino team who absolutely love raspberries and the donald yeah that one actually 2010 bottle so even older  anyhoo all geeked for it it pours a ruddy brown with light redpink notes to it claims of bullshit fill the air i think we were up like 200 after 2 innings so this popped off celebration style didnt amass much of a head but it was still carbonated the aroma had a moderate amount of raspberry to it but also pervasive sourness  the taste was enjoyable its easy to hurr durr acidity warheads teeth enamel jokes but this wasnt terrible yes it was overly sour but thankfully michael crushed half the bottle it seemed maltier than most lambics i guess theyre calling it a wild ale now makes sense one dimensional raspberry  sour power but whatever
3680,Raspberry,3.77,bottle from brewandbbq thanks for the opportunity lightly hazy golden with a red tint to it light smattering of bubbles light carbonation lemony tart acid with sweet and tart berry pretty nice
3681,Raspberry,4.18,2018 vintage aged 3 years drank in 2021 amazingly tart and juicy raspberry lambic  sour well made and balanced
3682,Raspberry,4.02,really good sour raspberry flavor with a delicious malt aftertaste slightly too tart but otherwise excellent
3683,Raspberry,3.93,reviewed from longstanding notes 2012 vintage 750 ml bottle stored appropriately and opened on 12118 poured into an el catador barrelaged glass  a hazy to murky copperish red with quite a bit of visible carbonation forms a thin white head that doesnt stick around  s big lactic sour with a much milder acetic tang underneath big underripe raspberries and cherries and malic acid punch lactobacillus funk cheese and feet light cracker malts and i think a touch of woody dryness maybe a touch of brettanomyces funk and dryness but its buried under all the lactic and fruity sourness this isnt quite nosehairsearing but its smells sour for sure  t again a big lactic sourness up front raspberry fruity accompanied by some serious malic acid lactobacillus funk again maybe some pediococcus on the palate cheese and barnyard and horsey some light cracker malts then a sizeable punch of lemony citric acid near the swallow with more seriously tart raspberries  m average body for most american sours carbonation sensation a bit towards the low end low alcohol flavors  o this was a pretty darn tasty fruited sour even after extended years the age seems to have rounded out some of the acidity at least compared to some of the other upland sours ive had its not the most tasty or complex or nuanced raspberry sour youll ever have but its enjoyable
3684,Congress Street IPA,3.06,canned on 71923  a pours with a near opaque cloudiness a dense white head rises with good retention and lace manageable to pour if you go slow s some sweet fruits most people are saying pineapple sure i guess i can go with that i dont know if these kinds of neipas overwhelm me to a point were i just cant pick anything out cause i dont get near the expressive fruityhops aromas as others its just vaguely there t yep sweet and fruity like store bought dole juice to me i dont get anything in the finish but some hop burnor alcohol cant figure it out mo i guess i cant be too hard but just muddled to me low carbonation sticky sweet no finish some kind of astringency either from hop burn or alcohol burn this is going to be a chore to finish  every once in a while i like to revisit styles im not the biggest fan of especially when a hyped brewery pops up in my area to see if or how my tastes change well this is a style i have yet to really enjoy some will say dont review styles you dont like but im just trying to see what everyone but me seems to likeoh well
3685,Congress Street IPA,4.34,poured with a soft thick head comprised of tiny bubbles like steamed milk for a latte nose is all galaxy  pineapple peach citrus and rind as well as hints of melon trillium seems to have a knack for highlighting melon notes from several different hops and melon is in the foreground in the taste which is fruity but not sweet with a nice gentle bitterness on the finish
3686,Congress Street IPA,4.44,pours like a mix of lemon and orange juice nicely hazy with a soft pillowy head honestly the nose didnt match the beer a little yeasty and muddy lots of citrus notes but not overly sweet so it had a nice balance an exemplary hazy ipa one that is equally drinkable and cherishable
3687,Congress Street IPA,4.83,this is a type of hazy ipa i wish i had more access to not too muddied and plenty of citrus moving forward sharp finish for a hazy just the right amount of malt a very clear tasting hazy if that makes sense well done and i can see why this brewery is rated so high
3688,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.96,l dark pitch black as it should be with no light at all looks very thick s dark chocolate dark coffee roast some faint dark fruit and bourbon barrel age is well hidden t absolutely heavenly and smooth with the flavors mentioned under the smell does not feel like an 11 abv beer yet you get the effects afterwards f thick smooth and luscious overall this is the best imperial stout that ive had and its not even close i first had this in 2021 during the warm weather months and its truly better than even kbs
3689,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.32,very good head production but retention is lacking fading to only the thinnest possible ring around the rim of the glass before long body is a lovely obsidian hue colalike along the edges  aroma is quite strong prominently featuring the bourbon notes of bourbon mash brown sugar oak leather red grape cherry coconut syrup  flavor absolutely delivers on a classic bcbslike bba imperial stout lots of bourbon but not overpowering moderate char bitter but not overly hoppy nor too roasty coming across on the more restrained side of ris toffee ginger cookies raisin coffee prune bourbon oak leather white pepper blackstrap molasses  exceptionally easy to sip savor and chew despite the abv and barrel influence does finish fairly hot on the back third letting you know just how big it is  this is an excellent ba ris with tons of complexity and an admirable restraint on all fronts its supremely drinkable and less rich than most others without sacrificing flavor that said i personally wish it delivered more richness along with that complexity perhaps just a touch more sweetness and thickness i also favor ais over ris which certainly influences my take on this one
3690,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.23,plead the 5th from dark horse brewing 12 oz can stored at 34 degrees at home received from whyteboar in nbw bif 16 reviewed 051222 note that i use ddmmyy protocol undated can served at 534 degrees in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter the final temperature was 577 degrees appearance  35 first pour  amber brown srm 18 clear body  brown srm 20 opaque under direct light same when rear lite opaque except at the edges  bottom edge ruby top edge olive head  average maximum 12 cm aggressive center pour buff high density with a few surface rocks quickly diminishing to a 01  015 cm crown and a thin island lacing  none not much expected at 11 abv aroma  425  chocolate weak char and some hints of bourbon no hops no yeast flavor  45  chocolate and slight char with a slightly bitter aftertaste bourbon not detected slight oakiness no hops or yeast no ethanol 11  abv as marked on label aroma or taste moderate gastric warming occurs no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl palate  4  medium dry side of creamy soft but lively carbonation final impression and summation 4 after deducting 025 point for undated personal container look unremarkable pretty much like every other high abv ris or impy stout aroma is fairly typical but has a char note that many lack and lacks the coffee notes that many have bourbon is present on the nose but seems absent in the taste the taste also has both chocolate and char as well as an oakiness from vanillin but lacks the tannin notes as the temperature reaches the end some bourbon notes finally appear overall a good ris thats certainly more subtle than most
3691,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.18,i had a 2016 and was curious what 6 years of aging would do definitely mellowed it out a bit and knocked off the rougher edges mostly left with a mellow oak and vanilla bourbon flavor over a nice toasty base stout quite nice
3692,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.32,look  fantastic black and thick with a really nice thick foamy tan head smell  dark chocolate caramel molasses roasted malts boozy and bourbon woody smells taste  chocolate coffee with that woody caramel molasses bourbon barrel from the get go slight dark fruit and vanilla in the back with a little bit of bitterness feel  medium full body with a very light carb could use a little more thickness to it in my opinion but still nice overall  really nice classic ba russian imperial very complex with a ton of smells and flavors

3700,Gumballhead,2.84,looks the part smells like a decent apa which is exactly what this garbage is if i wanted an apa id buy alpha king the only aspect of this beer that represents an american wheat ale is the wheat the rest was brewed as a standard apa this will be my last go round with this beer
3701,Gumballhead,3.28,pleasant beer very smooth and once warmed up can taste the lemon coming through not sure where this sits on a wheat beer scale seems like its top notch on that however but a good change of pace from hop forward ipas
3702,Gumballhead,4.37,ive had this beer on tap at the brewery tap room a couple of times over the years and although it was good it never impressed me maybe due to the fact that i would be drinking zombie dust at the same sitting today of all places gumballhead was on tap at midway airport chicago i was psyched that anything from 3 floyds was on tap at the airport so i decided to have a 20 ounce pour while waiting for my flight to depart well all i can say is wow first the beer exceeded my expectations for freshness i figured i would be getting some old kegged beer thats been sitting around not the case this beer was crisp and had some life to it it was served colder than a wheat pale ale should be but man did it quench my thirst the beer had an orangish wheaty look to it and had similar aromas the taste had a touch of sweetness and the bitterness was subdued and hit my palette just right making the beer extremely smooth and drinkable just a great drinking experience and i have a whole new respect for the quality and taste for this beer
3703,Gumballhead,4.09,l translucent light copper color fine carbonation bubbles throughout generous head trying to hold on s citrusy subtle rather than overpowering t citrus taste on top of a satisfying wheat base f matches the carbonation and color very well o a fine wheat ale glad 3fs are now in md

3712,Oculto,1.99,12oz bottle with a fine layer of dust  this is rotgut tequila dropshotted into a very poor limeflavored lager nothing more nothing less if youre into that i guess id only drink this if i was somehow very desperate to be drunk the 6 is hidden well i guess
3713,Oculto,2.79,it sounded good it looked good even smelled good the taste was oversweetened lime juicy funk i had to force myself to finish the six pack i think i tried pouring tequila in it and adding a lime and that didnt help a damn bit awful stuff
3714,Oculto,3.25,blended with beer aged on tequila barrel staves blue agave infused interesting mixture with definite tequila hints also tastes like many of the tasty summer brews the finish could be better 20150726
3715,Oculto,5,people think this beer sucksboy you must not be a real beer taster of you cant enjoy the beer simple things matt and so do flavor so i your a great beer drinker you find the good in mostly everydrink unless its a 4 loko those are the worst ocultos was talking over the top beers way better than budlight and america beers
3716,Oculto,4.94,so refreshing i love this beer
3717,Oculto,4.88,i dont know why so many people are leaving horrible reviews i absolutely loved this beer and think it was genius to brew in tequila barrels abita brew does the same only with bourbon barrels and those fly off the shelves perhaps its a cultural thing as most of the people i know who loved it as much as i do were latinos i wish it wasnt taken off shelves and anheuserbusch would consider putting them backat least in the high latino community stores
3718,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.9,184 so good
3719,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.52,putting a little pep in your step and numbing the senses all at once 3 floyds pink peppercorn and cinnamon dark lord variant takes this imperial stout to the nuclear level and with snacks  jet black and pouring like ink chemtrailmix alerts the nose with a strong savory and sultry blend of coffee cocoa whisky spice port wine and sherry as the inky elixir hits the tongue the taste is enlivened with the sweetness of brown sugar blackstrap molasses toffee honey and caramel with hints of chocolate and condensed fruit  as the stout extends across the middle palate the sweetness slowly turns to dry a rise of espresso bakers chocolate roasted nuttiness and campfire char keeps the session hefty before the spices of cinnamon and peppercorn tease the palate with a gentle dry prickle trending warm with rye whisky and oak the late palate trends coconutlike with vanilla earthen grit and caramel with those savory aged port and sherry savory qualities  full bodied pleasantly chewy and offcloying chemtrailmix finishes maltydry spicy and very warm with impressions of sherry and coconut lingering in aftertaste this calls for a long patient and sipping session with high rewards and a surprising rate of drinkability if you can tolerate the combination of whisky and spice
3720,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.74,pours a pure coal black color with a sudsy dark tan head that is fairly quick to flee the nose features the cinnamon up front and with extreme prejudice  this is bigly cinnamon theres also a nice spicy note from the peppercorn and some chocolate and a subtle barrel note  the barrel is more pronounced on the taste and a perfect spicy complement to the peppercorn flavor  and the still bigly cinnamon which is delicious theres also chocolate and a surprising bit of stone fruit theres a lot going on here and its all magnificent imho  the mouthfeel is velvety and coats the mouth properly commensurate with a beer of this magnitude what a pleasure it is to finally experience this world class beer
3721,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.52,2020 version poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter heavy cinnamon on the nose and in the flavor with a mild spice nicely thick a little chocolate and barrel mixed in happy to finally try this
3722,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.75,dig the cinnamon a lot with a unique peppery spice supremely fudgy body that lingers nice barrel too
3723,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.73,l deep brownish black with a slight light brown head  s sweet burnt sugar almost a hint of molasses heavy cinamonny like cinnamon toast crunch  t ultra sweet up front but works and becomes balanced with the cinnamon cant really get the pepper tastes besides slightly on the tongue but know its there for the balance finishes with a faint rye whiskey flavor  f viscous which coats the mouth proper thickness  o this beer is superb well balanced overall much like a liquid cinnamon toast crunch and sweet cinnamon roll couldnt have more than one glass extremely decadent
3724,Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,4.9,172 fantastic
3725,Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,5,phenomenal poured cold to a glencairn glass dark burnt caramel color minimal fusefast head aroma is unexpectedly heavy prune with a base of leather and light vanilla first sips are laden with bourbon bite i mean a heavy hit of hot but enjoyably sweet spirit the barrel wood is forward bringing images of saturated staves oozing booze and tannins i dont even know the abv but its easy to kick back a big swigthough i only have this one lonely can to enjoy mouthfeel is full with a nice stickiness the caramel bites are all over the middle and end flavors it carries traits similar to a stoutbarleywine cuv√©e like anchorages endless endings wherein there is a dark malt middle flavor once the sip is gone and youre enjoying the linger i also find it similar to fremonts b6k but with a much more subdued and harmonious sweetness profile next time ill try to get a 4pack i had a meeting that dayin hindsight it was with an asshole so my time would have been better spent ordering beer online
3726,Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,4.91,poured at fridge temp drank over the course of half hour to get full array of how this beer would taste at different temps just great bourbon  vanilla  raisin notes on the nose high expectations heading in and the flavor did not disappoint booze is well masked heavy flavors of toffee vanilla maple dark chocolate and bourbon  fantastic bevvy

3728,All Day IPA,4.2,lower abv 475 but good taste great for allday affairs 15 cans for 12 pack pricing  cant go wrong as good as other local ipas and much better than any major brand
3729,All Day IPA,3.86,clear deep gold with white head great retention thin rings of lace floral citrus and pine hop aromatics a bit sweet malt underneath toasty sweet malt followed by citrus and pine hop flavors light bodied appropriately carbonated i could actually drink this all day along with an equal amount of water
3730,All Day IPA,3.75,the taste is good and rich belying its low abv a great choice when you need to carry on with the day
3731,All Day IPA,4.16,lovely sticky fresh hopforward smell bitter in a good way just enough breadymalty flavor at the end to balance aftertaste has some tropical fruit mouthfeel is nice and as light as youd expect with its low abv great to get so much hop flavor packed into something with a 47 abv while this isnt my favorite ipa i cant think of another ipa under 5 i like more
3732,All Day IPA,3.58,odd i never have reviewed this beer i think i should have waited to have it from draft instead of from an individual can from total wine  poured into a tulip glass clear yellow color with a brief foamy head with some curtain lacing fruity smell and taste dank and bitter but seemed a bit stale it wasnt bad with the pizza
3733,All Day IPA,3,15 pack purchased from a local food lion upon opening the 12 ounce 355 ml can it was poured into a glass poured a deep amber with a nice head of foam looks like beer smell was grains malt maybe some pine tasted like beer smooth and not at all bitter not sure about the ibu rating mouthfeel was smooth but not at all watery overallthis ipa is a work of art so to speak refreshing and well crafted i do think i like the bourbon barrel stout a bit better though kind of reminds me of a good brew from queensland only made in america i would hughly recommend this beer
3734,All Day IPA,3.77,pours deep clear gold mild carbonation small frothy head mild mannered in smell and taste hippiness and mild florals come through fresh and quaffable easy like sunday mornings love the packaging also always adds to the experience
3735,All Day IPA,4.06,canned 042723  l pours a pale to deep gold color with excellent clarity the pours gives two fingers of frothy offwhite head with good retention as the beer goes down it leaves a nice ringed and webbed lacing on the glass  s oranges grapefruit rind grainy pale malt and light notes of dry pine needles as the beer opens up i also get light notes of caramel malt  t this one follows the nose pretty closely i get oranges grainy and biscuity malt character a bit of pine and a light grapefruit bitterness on the backend and finish  f medium body with mediumlow carbonation the mouthfeel is smooth and slick with a light dryness on the finish  o this one packs in a lot of flavor for a session ipa it reminds me of lawsons super session series easy drinking flavorful and all for a decent price its not the best ipa in the world but as far as session ipas go it is definitely in my top 10
3736,All Day IPA,4.21,waited entirely too long before finally trying this only to discover its got a lot going for it for such a lowabv ipa manages to capture much of the characteristics of a classic apa and is very tasty and solid for its weight class would happily enjoy again
3737,All Day IPA,5,this could be the last beer i ever need to drink a beer you could spend the rest of your life with  friggen store keeps raising the price though drive out to nevada and you can still buy the 15 pack for 16 and no recycling crap attached to it great drinking two of these after two scotches all you need for a good night besides a good woman
3738,All Day IPA,4,12oz canned 22723 opened 41623 2 finger dense offwhite head with excellent staying power sticky lacing glowing dark golden and clean body citrus  orange lemon and pine in the nose oranges on top of doughy malt and a lingering pithy bitterness bright entry light body with medium carbonation nice pop of bitterness in a lengthy offdry finish impressive in a sub 5 abv package very good
3739,La Fosse,4.3,185 just ok
3740,La Fosse,4.54,look  haze yellow fantastic rimming and lacing smell  tart stone fruit like apricot peach taste  candied tart apricot just delicious feel  medium body and fizz medium carb overall  delicious
3741,La Fosse,4.4,375ml bottle label has 2022 vintage cloudy straw colored body brief white head no lacing aroma is apricot and wild ale leather pear and peach taste is apricot with leather grassy and white grape medium mouth feel dry finish okay carbonation sublime nose and flavors with apricot as the base note
3742,La Fosse,4.45,purchased a bottle of this beer at the brewery in march  poured into a tulip glass hazy yellow color with brief effervescent white head with little lacing smell and taste of ripe tart fruit apricot and peaches tart but a mellow smooth flavor nice full feel wonderfully refreshing excellent wild ale
3743,La Fosse,4.49,taking inspiration from famous brussels apricot sour ale side project is brewing more like pros when brewing and aging their own unique spin on the fruited gueuze style  la fosse brings a golden tinge to an otherwise bubbly champagne pour but the beer strikes the nose with force as the overwhelming sour scent tightens the jaws and wets the whistle with fruit funk and fauna a scantly sweet introduction is of light wafer sourdough and a brief hint of taffy  but anything seeming sweet is short and succinct on the middle palate the session quickly favors the stone fruit with a light orange mango and peach character shying away from fruit rollup the beer quickly trends vinous and winey with sharp chardonnay bubbly dryness and a piquant spice its bracing acidity washes any thirst from the palate as the late taste brings an earthen tone of balsa burlap and extended woodage white wine  light crisp and highly refreshing the ale is a cleaner taste compared to more brussels brewed versions but this brighter cleaner and fruitier version is just as good
3744,La Fosse,4.5,finally made it for a visit to side project and they happened to have bottles of this for onsite so got one and no regearts sour but not too sour and just fully of ripe juicy apricot flavor glad i got it
3745,La Fosse,4.51,drank as part of a beer tasting with ron not sure about the price cool bottle neat cap consumed on 040723 review from notes  as the beers appearance is bright orange at first and moves to a muddy orange as the remaining beer and sediment are poured in the head is fizzy and big there is some lacing the aroma is powerful chalky yeast tart peaches and apricots  tm the taste is acidic fruity tart and lemony very clean cereal finish tartness is cleared out when the sediment is poured in and the funk comes through more than before the high carbonation is champagnelike at first then comes in a little more creamy later on  overall it is one of the better beers i have ever had perfect for a warm summer day
3746,Sculpin,4.42,this beer and bells two hearted ale are the best two widely distributed old school ipas in america this one leans bitter and the other leans sweet both are exceptional and difficult to surpass cheers
3747,Sculpin,4.57,its my favorite among american ipas has slightly sour taste but comes across as very fruity unfortunately this beer and the grapefruit version which is perhaps the even more gifted sibling is hardly ever available around where i live
3748,Sculpin,5,this is a ridiculously good beer unfortunately we cant seem to get it any more here in texas bottles are always better than cans
3749,Sculpin,3.4,pour clear and golden but the head doesnt last long aromas of apples and light flowery with medum strength taste is juicy enough but im getting a bit of harshness like carbonation i dont get the high ratings of this one not very thick in the mouth feels like carbonation when you leave on your tongue  overall  i will not buy this one again just not that impressed
3750,Sculpin,4.57,this is the best west coast american ipa i have ever had the hops taste crisp and go great with food  particularly crabs fried seafood and steak truly a world class beer
3751,Sculpin,4.61,one of my favorites
3752,Sculpin,3.78,12oz can pkg 031323 2 months ago poured into a spiegelau ipa glass at fridge temp 7 abv the beer pours bright light amber with light khaki head the head recedes to an irregular ring and rocky cap slight lacing the aroma is mild with light citrus pine and caramel the taste is bittersweet piney citrus with relatively weak caramel malt strong bitterness mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with average carbonation and mostly dry finish overall good but not the world class ipa it once was
3753,Sculpin,4.15,great san diego ipa lovely goldenrod color big bouquet aroma big head that lasts most of the way through the glass its lovely plenty of apricot lemon and maybe cantaloupe aromas big pineylemonytropical hop flavor nice viscous body this is a winner cans were on sale  i never pay full price for sculpin its great for them that they have pricing power and can extract a 2 3 or even 5 price premium per 6pack but there are probably ten other ipas i enjoy as much or more and theyre cheaper if i can get in for 126 sculpin is a solid choice thats not very frequent which again is good for ballast point brewing
3754,Sculpin,3.9,not a big fan too floral malty carbonated
3755,Sculpin,4.43,classic west coast ipa honestly prefer this one over the iconic stone ipa give both a try and see which one you like the most
3756,Sculpin,4.08,smells great with an exquisite finish with a citrus like smell hops pull through and is strong and lasts until aftertaste solid beer but prefer the visuals and smell over the taste
3757,Duck Duck Gooze,4.1,fobab 2022
3758,Duck Duck Gooze,4.55,2019 vintage  appearance pours a cloudy apricot with a one finger head that leaves some streaky lacing as it reduces to a film  smell tart lemon green apple white wine grape and oak layered with some barnyard funk  taste tart lemon forward with white wine grape and green apple rounding out the lactic parade oak and barnyard funk through the middle with a sour yogurt finish  mouthfeel light to medium body with moderate carbonation puckery  overall long time want and glad to finally get a chance to taste this lives up to its billing
3759,Duck Duck Gooze,4.55,at long last it was always scandalous to me that the top rated gueuze on this site was from outside belgium and while i still feel this is not the best gueuze i have ever had i can now see why it is in that echelon of the style cloudy yellow pour finger of sudsy white foam good mix of spotted and splotchy lacing lemon sliced tart apple lacto barnyard funk white grape flowers hay and earthy oak in the potent nose taste is just as potent but not as complex as the sour notes lead more than the barnyard funk oak backs the sour fruits well slight earth yogurt funk and decent hay round out a more sunny disposition for the style leans sour more than funky but both present in spades but the body is light and nuanced despite the potency i would love to age a bottle of this as i think it would age really nicely
3760,Duck Duck Gooze,4.65,2022 vintage sidebyside with mother of all gooze anniversary blend  hazy golden yellow coloration gusher on the pop frothy white carb  nose is sweet tart funky notes of underripe peach lemon zest and bright musty funk  palate tart and full of stone fruit flavors medium acid and a touch of minerality you can tell the youth on this whereas on moag you really can tell the age on the blend
3761,Duck Duck Gooze,4.47,received from dimidiata pours a bright golden color with a small amount of shortlived white head that receded to a thin ring fully translucent almost clear aroma has tons of funk well complemented by complex wine and barrel noted along with lemon  dandelion overall a wonderful smelling beer  taste picks up right where the nose left off i get apricots wine barrel apple vinegar lemon hay and general barnyard funk acidity is spot on tart but it doesnt beat you over the head allowing all the other wonderful flavors their time in the spotlight light bodied bright crisp and clean  overall an absolutely wonderful beer
3762,Pliny The Elder,4.68,l  light yellow golden with a ton of clarity a white head that dissipates quickly leaving behind a thin cap and a good amount of lacing s  bright floral piney hops along with notes of citrus zest t  follows the nose bright fresh floral pine slightly bitter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with notes of citrus  candied grapefruit orange zest  cracker malt a little bit of honey grass notes f  light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation  bright fresh crispy  very clean o  one of the benchmarks for the west coast ipa style incredibly well balanced and easy to drink glad to have finally gotten my hands on it
3763,Pliny The Elder,4.23,solid
3764,Pliny The Elder,4.25,served in an imperial nonic pint glass  this beer pours a golden hue and is topped with a couple inches of offwhite head that leaves nice lacing  it has a real nice fruity citrus aroma i get a little pine  nice balance of citrus and pine flavors a little bit of lingering resin in the finish  very good iipa its one of the pioneers as with all trailblazers newer and better beers come along i live in ohio and am very happy that i can drink hop juju someday it too will be a trailblazer in the rearview mirror of my lifelong beer trek
3765,Pliny The Elder,5,pliny is really difficult to find in southern cal but i finally tried one for the first time at the russian river brew pub in santa rosa it was on tap so super fresh i think it is probably the most well balanced dipa i ever tried i now understand the hype
3766,Pliny The Elder,4.62,an excellent brew without taking anything away from pliny i prefer heady topper  sip of sunshine
3767,Pliny The Elder,4.44,my first pliny 2 week old bottle so quite fresh extremely well dialed in almost leaves a piney resin on your lips and tongue
3768,Busch Ice,5,before i started my beer reviews earlier this year i had somewhat tongueincheek declared busch ice as my favorite beer but busch ice being an excellent beer is no joke the price the flavor the drinkability the abv heck even the way the can looks i love everything about this beer one of my all time favorites  style ice lager  tapcanbottle can  abv 59  rating 5
3769,Busch Ice,3.1,when enjoying a beer its important to take price into account this is not an outstanding beerfar from it but it provides a decent amount of alcohol for a mainstream lager it smells like alcohol and green apples the taste is crisp but bland mostly cereal grains with a faint hint of hops aftertaste brings back that ethanol theme  this is a beer to enjoy while getting buzzed or drunk and nothing more it does what its supposed to do
3770,Busch Ice,3.16,poured into a tulip which was a mistake keep reading from deep chill fridge can form factor  a very clear pale straw yellow 2 mm stark white head shrinks to a thin ring and slight lacing  s typical cheap vomitous aal hops with a swish of banana ester in the background not the strong point and the tulip concentrated it eww  t actually not as gross as nose keep it cold use a koozie if you do not do this it gets a little chalky as it warms corn flakes grainy slight hint of less than carapils malt notes hops are slight and maybe on the mildly earthy and a were tiny hint of herbal note that peeks at warmer temps nothing too egregious but nothing too exciting  m creamy medium body that leaves some slick mouthfeel behind nothing harsh at edge of tongue very slight chalkiness at warmer temps  o i got this for an aggregate price of 55 cents a can and 59 abv if i cut this with 50 water i get a beer equivalent to miller64 for about 27 cents per 12 oz beer equivalent i cant touch miller64 for that price and any other beer in this range is far worse vomitious walrus piss it has merit in this sense but not much else
3771,Busch Ice,2,had that one time at a party back in the day i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included
3772,Busch Ice,2.18,25oz can into a tall glass my guess is it was canned sometime in march 2022 but thats only a guess  looks very nice in a tall thin glass crystal clear pale golden yellow body big bright white head shrinks to a ring and covering excellent lacing  unfortunately it smells like floral vomit  the taste is smooth slightly sweet and malty clean but it is also very thin and very watery with no real taste  mouth between thin and medium finish watery and a little drying  overall after the look this beer falls off a cliff at least it was only 3 bucks
3773,Busch Ice,3.43,its not the greatest beer in the world for sure but if you just finished mowing the yard it hits the spot or if youre short on the green then its the perfest brew at 550 a sixpack 16 ounces ill take this over the hifalutenoverpriced craft beer every day
3774,Busch Ice,3,its definitely not awful its not great or mind blowing but its a decent tasting lager thats also really cheap its very light straw clear decent white head with surprisingly good retention smell is sweet malt and mineral water a hint of sulfur tastes semisweet with a tart finish not exactly sour but tart theres a slightly sour aftertaste that i actually enjoyed this sample is from a 16 oz can i cant say this would be my goto beer but at 579 for a sixer of pints its for sure a good value for those on a budget ive been there before the finish is crisp and semi dry it also makes good micheladas if youre into those theres absolutely nothing better after youve been out working in some really hot weather start with 1 part clamato and 2 parts beer add tabasco lime tajin even some orange juice it doesnt have to be precise enjoy
3775,Busch Ice,3.34,anheuserbusch busch ice 25 fl oz can coded 22102 wa1009 sampled on 7 may 2022 179  carools discount liquor merchantville nj  notes via stream of consciousness its a good thing i bought the big one seeing as how this is rated awful on beeradvocate ehh it was only 179 and i got to get the eye for going into a store in camden nj that i damned well knew i shouldnt be in i know i know its technically merchantville  i cant figure out how thats possible  but its a block away from whats technically camden what can i say i like the weirdo beers and malt liquors its poured a clear straw gold body beneath a fingers width of white foam the head seems to be holding pretty well so it seems pretty good so far the aroma is limited to a generic but clearly adjunctenhanced beer there are no real hops just a smear in the background on the upside its clean but this isnt a malt liquor its just 59 abv so i wouldnt expect anything weird on to the taste it follows the aroma which is a good thing in that its clean but bad in that its fairly boring t here is a little bit of an applelike fruitiness to it though its lightly sweetish and thus nicely balanced by a moderate bitterness and generic background hoppiness the alcohol never shows but then again at 59 it shouldnt although it is possible i assure you it finishes mainly dry with a very short lingering finish its basically the same beer from start to finish except that you get a little more malt upfront and the apple doesnt step in until midpalate ive had worse european light lagers that have had more character to them but werent nearly as well made and then theres the beers from the baltic region and russia that honestly seem like theyve been brewed with antifreeze of course in parts of russia that could be a selling point  whatever beer  keeps you from freezing so were basically done here in the mouth its medium on the lighter side and gently crispthensmooth
3776,Busch Ice,2.38,this one pours a watery looking golden yellow color with a small head and lots of lacing  this smells like sweet corn and grassiness and not much else  this is certainly not good but its honestly not as a bad as i thought it could be its not as skunky as it could be with just very little flavor to it overall  a mild sweetness and a decent crispness on the back end is about all i get  this is light bodied mostly clean and very watery  i expected this to be dumpster juice but its basically slightly sweet water that tastes like its been left out for a while
3777,Busch Ice,2.15,12oz can  review from notes  this is like regular busch lite but with a shot of rotgut poured in and you arent getting much more abv for how much worse this tastes  rusty headache water
3778,Busch Ice,1.56,i bought a can from the beerstore in ontario 473ml at 55 my can was brewed by labatt brewing company in canada it poured a 1finger head into glass that quickly evaporated and left a little lace but the taste was skunky not that enjoyable to me medium bitterness very slow carbonation maybe the one brewed in the states is better but this is awful i must say  cheers
3779,Busch Ice,4.09,this is the best ice beer in its class all other ice beers bow to this one it has the best taste of them as long as it is cold of course there are better beers out there but for hot day after mowing the lawn this one is fine
3780,Elderberry Gose,4.25,on tap at the vermont tap house in rutland vermont
3781,Elderberry Gose,4.03,my cans say 5 so maybe they tweaked the recipe in any event  translucent ruby red with light quicklydissipating pink head  smell is the typical fresh breeze aroma plus some moderate vague fruitiness  taste is basic gose plus a moderate lightlyjammy fruit flavor if tasted blind im not sure i could peg this as elderberry but its definitely doesnt come across as grape or raspberry alone its nice that the fruit doesnt obscure the base beer slight drying bitterness at finish and lingering afterward that is in keeping with elderberry moderate tartness not puckering but enough to notice  feel is light but not watery with moderate veryvery fine soft carbonation  overall well done going with elderberry is a nice detour off wellbeaten paths but that it is a gose is still apparent nice 
3782,Elderberry Gose,4.06,surprisingly excellent gose here that finds a great balance between the base beers brackishness and tart wheat character and the added elderberries that are neither overpowering or artificial tasting super refreshing would buy this as a 12 pack  82100
3783,Elderberry Gose,3.69,nice balance of fruit and sour flavor small head quickly dissipated
3784,Elderberry Gose,3.99,really well done and pretty unique ive tired greatly on sours especially kettle variety in the past few years but this was bucking that  its tartness not necessarily sourness in the trad sense that makes this beer good carbonation nd fuller body for a 5er the color is a beautiful pinkish ruby hue little foam  well done
3785,Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest,3.38,look clear gold with about a half inch white head good retention  smell sweet malts and hops  taste follows smell blend of sweet and earthybitter aftertaste is more on the bitter side  feel normal carbonation mediumlight body  overall solid drinkable brew
3786,Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest,3.94,12oz bottle into a pint glass best by 4424  looks nice crystal clear pale golden body with a small white head soecks of lacing faint malty aroma clean slightly sweet taste clean finish n ok aftertaste better than expected
3787,Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest,4.09,330 ml poured into a pint glass pour is deep straw light gold in color fairly clear and with an easily regenerated cap of foam aroma is lightly hopped and offers some rich malt notes notes of lemony hops as the cap settles taste follows with a rich but not sweet malt delivery lemony notes return on the finish feel is quite full and fits the style but not obviously sweet some complex malt residuals add depth nice base malt gives a good balance for the style abv right in the zone overall i think it edges out paulaner by a nose
3788,Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest,3.81,picked up a single at twgreenville sc 92422 for 149 best before 52323 consumed 12423 cold stored since purchase  beer poured gold with a very nice white head  nose is biscuity with a touch of honey  taste is a biscuity malt base that has a kiss of honey hopping is very balancing as i am not finding this with any residual sweetness  mouthfeel is light and refreshing  overall an enjoyable fest bier
3789,Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest,3.4,draft beer poured into a pilsner glass  color is a clear golden yellow with a 1 finger head that laces nicely aroma is slightly bready and mild not as spicy or malty as most of the darker m√§rzens ive had taste follows the nose with little carbonation  overall a good but not great but i would drink it again
3790,Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest,4.02,deep brassy gold tone compact yet fluffy head of foam drippy lacing doughy aroma malt and yeast both present light and flavorful mild bread crust toastiness vague earthy noble hop aftertaste slight malt sweetness initially becoming dry on the finish light creamy feel good structure and body overall im glad i got a six of this and that its fresh more aligned with festbier on style than m√§rzen

Stormaktsporter,5,n√§rke kaggen stormakts porter 2019  yields a night black color with a smaller mohagony colored head  the aromas lead with ground coffee honey dipped milk chocolate and matured spicy wood there is a leathery quality in this accompanied by lighter licorice and a note of caramel  mouthfeel on this is rich heavier bodied with a well fitting lower level of carbonation which manages to unfold a late effervescence  taste offers strong notes of bitter chocolate roasted espresso beans dried figs and a well nuanced amount of rich sweet chestnut honey reveals an intriguing creaminess then with additional camp fire smoke on top blending well into the bitter chocolate maltiness in this together with a lighter note of caramel and mansion dust finishes with a lingering herb dryness blending well into the coffee and chocolate bitterness in this intensified by the warming spicy and gnarly oak of the beer  fantastic complex and intense with a great balance to it this is as good as it gets regarding this style of beer with a beautiful carefully way of crafting a complex yet elegant beer
3792,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.5,smokey
3793,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.94,had low expectations but my gawd this beer blew me away easily the best porter ive ever had
3794,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.25,excellent porter one of the best roasty complex bold super challenging to acquire but definitely worth the chase got to try high coast next to it too amazing combo
3795,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.63,pours jet black with a small tan head intense roast bordering on smokey chocolate definitely some bourbon heat along with vanilla infused oak quite dry heat of the alcohol overwhelms my palate making tough to judge ibus full bodied long lasting finish

3797,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.92,clear copper body with an average size beige head and good lacing sweetness pokes through in the aroma along with the seasonal spices caramel and dark fruit compete for attention malt dominated taste sweet but not cloying molasses dark fruit orange peel and cinnamon all contribute with a hint of walnuts in the background mediumtofull bodied moderately carbonated mouthfeel that lead to a lingering finish
3798,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.86,poured from a 12 oz bottle into a a 12 oz glass nice amber color with a light brown short head that dissipates rather quickly leaving some nice lacing i really dont get a lot smell from this beer but the flavor is rather complex and good to me immediately i get carbonation with a mouth full then a toasted caramel finishing with nutmeg spice overall very drinkable
3799,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.19,look dark amber with a fluffy tan head  smell malt and spice reminds me of a candle shop  taste a hit of carbonation up front gentle malt that quickly fades into spice finishes with spicy orange peel  feel maybe a little heavy on the carbonation  overall not my favorite spiced brew from the beers for cheers variety pack
3800,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.69,poured from a 12 oz bottle pulled from the holiday mix pack no birth date pours amber red with little to no foam head slight taste of cinammon and other spices decent coupling of malt on the back a bit thin
3801,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.09,a once a year beer doubt the popularity is there if this was out more often great for christmas parties
3802,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.28,imperial pint look clear dark amber pouring a minimal head with light lacing which dissipated to nothing smell heavily toasted malt light baking spices strong sweet carmel and toffee notes taste light bitterness leads to little sweetness caramel and dark chocolate and hint of clove finish is smooth with heavily toasted malt and some colaesk note feel lightmoderate body with gentle carbonation overall its alright not my favorite of the lineup
3803,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.53,l deep ruby with a tan head that leaves a commendable amount of lacy good looking beer s spice with a hint of old sweatsocks not a great smelling beer t fortunately tastes much better than it smells getting a lot of fruit and spice but not overly sweet in my opinion f good carbonization maybe a bit thin for the style o good not great winter warmer the relatively low abv 59 for this style is a nice change of pace
3804,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.74,look pours a translucent shade of light brownish red with a one finger head of beige foam that leaves slightly below average amounts of lacing on the glass  aroma caramel and cherry mostly some notes of smoky fire wood and candied plums  taste upfront its slightly acidic with notes of cherry before immediately turning sweet with savory flavors of candied toffee and caramel midpalate some nice hints of cola and dark rum finishes sweet with gentle notes of nutmeg and very mild ginger the use of spices are well restrained and tempered here and not in your face or extremely assertive which i appreciate  feel sticky and sweet somewhat syrupy but not overly so body is medium weight and carbonation level is low sugar level is moderately high imparting some weight to the beer  overall not a bad winter warmer but there are better beers out there in the style
3805,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.85,2022dec18  15 x 12 oz bottles glass 05 l festmug abv 59 temp 551 f   look dark but clear mahogany with ruby highlights 2 creamy beige head the head lasted for a very long time leaving excellent lacing on the glass  aroma a plethora of deep but not dark malts cherries and some other fruits maybe stone fruits spicy cinnamon nutmeg and allspice some earthy notes there is a sharpness that makes me think of ginger  taste very malty and somewhat sweet though not bready toasted or burnt brown sugarcaramel very noticeable cherry notes the spices from the aroma are here along with some orange peel though they are not dominant the sharpness becomes a mild earthy bitterness here  feel mostly clean but a tad syrupy the body is mediumfull  overall a solid and quite drinkable holiday ale
3806,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,4.01,12oz bottle  pours a finger of tan head into my nitro glass retention is slightly below average and the head fades somewhat quickly lacing is patchy but not too bad body is a dark mahogany looks ok  nose is very sweet malty and a little spicy with notes of stone fruit and cherry smells pretty good but certainly has potential to be overly sweet  flavor certainly has some stone fruit and cherry quite malty honestly this is pretty good  carbonation is medium body is pretty light sweet but not overly so with a bit of tartness bitterness is low but not void a solid mouthfeel  drinkability is great this is tasty and pretty well balanced  overall a surprisingly good beer cant pick up the added spices but thats probably a good thing
3807,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,4.22,its wonderful to pour the contents of two twelve ounce bottles into a clear glass liter mug and not be overwhelmed by stark white foam instead theres a modest offwhite head atop a bright and dark caramel colored brew for all its color there remains a translucent quality as well in short a fine looking beer caramel malt and spices which seem to include allspice coriander and nutmeg provide the aroma thankfully the malt and maybe an assist from molasses is the dominant taste with the spices augmenting rather than dominating the flavor overall this is malty and sweet with a good caramel reference while that may not be great press its so much better than the now overload of winterholidaychristmas ales that merely overly spice a not so good brew the glass lacing whilst not spectacular does bear witness to each serving the body may not be outstanding as a a barley malt based brew but it far surpasses most beers that omit or drastically reduce it its claim is that its rich and sweet and it is but not too much in either way
3808,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,4.36,super good seasonal offering i wish this beer was available in a 6 pack instead of getting 2 in a winter 12 pack i look forward every year to the fezziwig 
3809,Schaarbeekse Kriek,3.77,this is a great fruited lambic for those who like it sour the combination of the tart schaarbeekse variety of cherries on top of the already tart 3f lambic base make for an experience that for me veered somewhat into acetic territory very clean however which was nice  76100
3810,Schaarbeekse Kriek,4.83,blend 61 20202021 season absolutely phenomenal an allnight sipper the depth and intensity of the cherries is absolutely amazing rivals the lou pepe kriek for the best kriek ive ever had
3811,Schaarbeekse Kriek,4.5,2019
3812,Schaarbeekse Kriek,4.35,20220716 750ml corkedcaged bottle served in a tulip bottling date 08262020 bought it earlier today at chucks hop shop seward park it was expensive  pours a dark purplish red with a small to nonexistent head  a thin white ring around the glass with sparse carbonation fairly hazy smell is rich berry jam and oaky acid tartness  taste is similar  rich berry jam more on the oak and less on the acid almost a funk to it and something that hints at a butteriness not diacetyl but something that just makes it seem fuller and richer moderate fruit skin bitterness characteristic  mouthfeel is medium bodied very dry overall this is a very good beer
3813,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.39,not bad in fact pretty good the abundant smell and taste of cherrys would make george washington blush
3814,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.42,sam adams cherry wheat is a decent seasonal beer granted you can find it on the shelves outside the fall  winter months but it really belong there its not nearly as refreshing drinking it on a hot summer day as opposed to a chilly fall or winter daynight  it has a bite when first taking a mouthful but finishes nicely the cherries are noticeable at first but after having more than one beer in a given setting you dont really notice the cherry taste anymore hence its not very vibrant its just there it also sits on the heavier side too so a 6 pack is generally enough for any one given person at a time
3815,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,4.42,i just want to say i have tried many cherry beers especially michigan cherry beers and pnw cherry beers this is hands down the best cherry beer i can drink all day or if i had to pick one cherry beer this is the one i would drink many times for sure most other cherry beer is tart and not sweetthis one is like if a normal light american lager had a hybrid with a bit of cherry coke just for some smooth lager cherry flavor i have bought many times very rarely is it a bad batch would recommend
3816,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.62,12oz bottle tulip best by may 2023 an office christmas gift as part of a mixed six  the color is rather golden with perhaps a nod of pink though that could simply be the suggestion the head was average and not long lasting  i smell beer and cherry smoothie i find the cherry aroma pleasant and real though its more like real cherry ice cream or a smoothie than fresh cherries sweet creamy fruity small tang  the taste very much follows cherry yogurt pale wheat ale base there is some bitterness to the finish which is mostly clean with a lingering sweetness like from one of them flavored sparkling waters thatre all the rage  moderate body and carbonation you can tell theres wheat in it by a slight matte feel to it  im a bit surprised given the reputation this beer at least used to have on this site id say a good word to describe it is pleasant as long as youre in the mood for something light and fruity cmon its clearly for nonbeer drinkers or beginners
3817,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,4.7,a great beer with michigan cherries
3818,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,4.21,look poured into pint glass 1 finger head yellow  smell cherries hit you immediately smells like a cherry soda  taste cherries and a traditional sam adams very good  feel dissipates quickly not heavy at all
3819,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,4.98,refreshingly flavored love the color been a favorite for 20 years the carbonation stands out and actually quenches the thirst perfectly
3820,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.8,pours a golden straw color with over a finger of head the nose is straightup maraschino cherries the flavor has sweet cherry notes as well the body is spot on  to his makes for an enjoyable springsummer session brew
3821,333 Premium Export Beer,2.81,provided during a dinner show at the majestic in saigon poured from the can  the beer pours a golden amber color with a frothy white head and light lacing the frothy head dissipated pretty quickly and head retention was fair at best so this isnt a very impressive looking beer on the nose things didnt get much better as i picked up sweet canned corn and maybe some light cereal grains the flavor profile was just more of the same in this lightweight beer with the sweet corn flavor dominating the beer is pretty watery with at most some light bitterness on the finish alcohol is undetectable and frankly i was surprised to see the abv listed as 53 would have guessed less  this is a pretty unimpressive beer inoffensive is probably the best thing i can say about it
3822,333 Premium Export Beer,2.12,review from 330ml can light golden colour with little to no head no distinguish smell with little floral after taste just another normal asian lager in the market on a positive note it does go well with vietnamese food which are mostly rich in flavour
3823,333 Premium Export Beer,3.47,can purchased from an import store in tokyo poured into a ceramic mug  immediately intrigued by the first sip a bold ricey flavor perhaps because it was my first rice beer but it left a strong impression very interesting and memorable
3824,333 Premium Export Beer,3.51,a fresh kind of crisp lager is what this is smells okay no foul tones on the contrary it is welcoming enough to make you want to taste it  and when you do you dont regret it it is very alright for an adjunct  lager no bitterness or metallic aftertaste whatsoever very drinkable very refreshing with mild carbonation the japanese should try to imitate american adjuncts instead of making a riced up german lager this is way better
3825,333 Premium Export Beer,2.82,from a can in vietnam pours a golden color with a half inch of white head sweet grass smell medium feel a little more substantial than other vietnamese beers malt forward taste dry on finish my experience seems better than others i guess if you find this fresh and drink it as cold as possible its not bad
3826,333 Premium Export Beer,3.03,my first in ho chi minh august 13th 2017 everything a macro should be light crisp and refreshing with hints of hops
3827,333 Premium Export Beer,2.53,drank from a can on an bang beach outside of hoi an vietnam accompanied a meal of steamed clams fried fish and stir fried morning glory our go to spot hosted by the lovely tuyet have enjoyed this many times
3828,333 Premium Export Beer,2.3,330ml pulltab can from a minimart in hanoi cost was below 050 usd 530 abv brief impressions below  has an odd adjuncty sweetness to it bending it towards syrupy definitely artificial in terms of flavour cheap malt syrup metallic offflavour pilspale malts no noticeable hop character  overcarbonated smooth wet unrefreshing mediumbodied where it ought to be lightbodied  drinkable as a budget brew when its cold most vietnamese canned beers seem to blend together with few distinctive characteristics but this is recognizably a notch below the norm  high d 250  not recommended   july 11th 2016 2nd can purchased in hoi an sabeco owns bia saigon apparently  the abnormally slender hole left by the pulltab once opened allows less beer through than most cans which is something of a godsend seeing how ghastly this is  sweet malt syrup adjunct corn rice who cares stale barley too sweet too simple and certainly shallow theres no intricacy or depth of flavour here at all and nothing really to come for save for the 530 abv which ill grant is above average for regional lagers and isnt badly disguised  not a beer i intend to revisit unless economy demands it even at its reasonablebywesternstandards price drinkable enough to be fair weve all had worse but its still pretty poor fare  d  avoid
3829,Angkor Beer,2.45,our first day in siem reap and this stuff is pretty much everywhere including the restaurant our tour guide took us to for lunch in any event  the beer pours a golden amber color with a frothy white head that quickly subsides still this beer really doesnt look half bad on the nose i get canned corn and a bit of grain and really not much else even for an aal this is a pretty unimpressive aroma profile the flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this lightweight aal theres some light sweet corn in the flavor profile and thats about it what flavor there is dissipates pretty quickly and the finish is short bland and lightly bitter mouthfeel is fairly light with the alcohol all but undetectable drinkability is good i guess if your idea of beer drinking involves uncritical quaffing of a cold beverage while out mowing the lawn  it gets pretty warm in this part of the world so i guess a beer as lame and insipid as this is somewhat understandable and even to be expected as others have pointed out its inoffensive which is probably the best you can say about it that being said next time im offered a beer at lunch or dinner ill opt for a diet coke or water instead
3830,Angkor Beer,2.54,6 pack from fubonn market pdx was not as bad as i thought it would be bright clear golden pour big fluffy head smell and taste are grains corn and only slight traces of vegetal notes feel is actually kind of creamy not too sweet either first cambodia tick
3831,Angkor Beer,1.96,shared 330 ml can kindly brought home from cambodia by my cousin abv is 5 pale golden colour moderate white head minimal aroma watery mouthfeel the flavour is quite dry and rather bland as expected with a hint of hops in the finish
3832,Angkor Beer,3.2,when your in cambodia its decent and an easy goto rather than paying the premium for imported beers ignore the bad reviews when your at a bar though i cant speak about its quality outside
3833,Angkor Beer,3.52,12 oz slim can traded from brutal farce poured into 16 oz budweiser pint glass  clear golden amber color with a fluffy white head of 2 fingers it gradually diminishes to a sliver no lacing  aroma is husky and grainy slight sweet apple fruit almost cidery faint maize  flavor is crisp and clean with a nice riceplantbarley flavor not much for lingering flavor except a slight champagne dryness and lingering pear and apple fruits corn creaminess as well  feel is crisp and clean with only mild starches on the finish very good carbonation  overall a poor rating is not warranted simply because a lager is not going to give the flavors that other more eccentric styles will this is a cut and dry enjoyable quenchable bythebook lager that stands with the rest fear not take the dive you wont lose beer karma if you drink it
3834,Angkor Beer,3,t14
3835,Angkor Beer,3.02,pours a very pale gold with no head and very aggressive bubbles  smells very grainy of cheerios  taste was more interesting light cracker with some floral notes and tart apple  very dry overly carbonated
3836,Angkor Beer,3.03,poured into a small pint glass pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing aroma of grainy malt lemon and grassy hops flavor is mild grainy slightly sweet malt grassy hops thinning out and getting astringent in the finish light to medium bodied with sharp carbonation on the grainy side of the adjunct lager spectrum but the malt pretty much dies out half way through the taste leaving the somewhat astringent possibly just old hops stark on the tongue the neutral malt sweetness that usually make this style inoffensive is not present here this just tastes like a watered down lager i liked their stout and decided to give this a shot but although i might welcome this on a hot cambodian afternoon its not worth revisiting outside its country of origin drinkable but mediocre
3837,Angkor Beer,4.45,angkor has a thick white head a clear golden bubbly appearance with splotchy glass lacing the aroma is of fairly rich honeyed malt and bread crust taste is similar with rounding hop bitterness mouthfeel is light to medium and angkor finishes crisp and refreshing  rjt
3838,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.35,pours a nearly clear golden color with a 1f head and moderate lacing  smells of slightly dank grassy piney hoops with citrus  tastes of light malt slightly tart grapefruit with sweeter orange and lemon with a moderately bitter alcohol warm finish  medium light body and carbonation dry mouthfeel  this is a lightly juicy crisp assertive west coast ipa
3839,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.25,pours a hazy amber color with a nice head and lacing aroma has malt and hop hints the taste has a malt and hop flavor a medium bodied well carbonated beer a good iipa
3840,Arctic Panzer Wolf,3.47,from the bottom of the can pkgd on 111822 q0711 this was a 16oz can from a 4pack  appearance the body is nearly opaque which allows only a very faint haze of a blurry shadow through it has a deep golden amber body which is on the darker side but not quite bronze there is a short and fluffy white head which maintains a thin layer of fluffy film over the surface with a creamy and fluffy ring around the glass there is some spotty lacing  aroma at first some wildflower aroma came through then some fruity peach and grapefruit came to the nose there is a touch of cabbage but each time it becomes apparent it pops out and is replaced by a more fruity aroma  taste the flavor closely mimics the aroma here there is this somewhat floral opening to the beer giving it a wildflower note up front which is a bit soaplike then it develops more citrus character on the tongue largely this mixture of pithy grapefruit and blood orange these two citrus notes persist to the end it has a somewhat grassy finish after a while some candied orange also comes through a tad  mouthfeel bitterness on this beer is high it has a body that is on the lower edge of medium with a touch of slickness it is a bit of a slow drinker given the high bitterness and the somewhat medium body  overall the citrus notes in this beer and the strong bitterness are the highlights there is plenty to enjoy when it comes to both of these qualities the beer also has a floral note which is not bad but when combined with the grassy character it clashes with the more citruscentric notes of the beer its an alright beer but im not likely to buy it again over what is readily available on the market the beer i purchased was consumed within 3 months of being canned so i might try it again if it was on tap or if it was fresher than the one i purchased i wouldnt advocate for or against it but i would recommend a single can or a sampler before buying a 4pack
3841,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.25,a piney citrusy bitter bomb outstanding
3842,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.24,6 oz draft minisnifter pour at lures bar  grille this is a great old school dipa caramel malt some alcohol heat in a good way citrus peel with a solid hit of bitterness very tasty overall
3843,The Dissident,4.04,2016 version leggy white front over hazy garnet pomegranate wine barrel cherry stone and light cheese on the nose cherry juice cider tin vanilla winey wood and cotton candy finish tart round sticky  4 425 4 375 4  theres a good oude bruin in there somewhere but its buried under a ton of cherry thats good news for anyone who cant handle the tartness but for anyone else theres something getting lost if it was a flanders red maybe i could see this much fruit theres some wood and only the vaguest funk after 7 years and the wine serves to double up those cherries  deep and fun in its own way but just too sweet
3844,The Dissident,4.34,2019 reserve with cherries 105 abv look a fairly clear and light cherry red with a minimal head that suds up quickly and rapidly dissipates to only a ring of film encircling the beer and leaving no lacing behind aroma i could smell it on the pour tart pie cherries oak barrels lactic acid notes ripe dark bing etc cherries wood tannins reminiscent of a cabernet sauvignon or similar red wine and wafts of some funky barnyardlike notes taste ripe dark cherries hit the palate first as layers of woody oak quickly join in the mingle with the cherry for a split second those notes hold before the quickly building acidity crescendos and as it does wet straw some leather and barnyard notes become evident and hold center stage until cherries reclaim the spotlight and lead to a very tart spritzy and acidic finish with zero detectable alcohol heat mouthfeel light but full very clean throughout looks low but drinks like its medium to highly carbonated and wonderfully dry on the finish overall wow this is straight up blowing my mind right now and in a very good way my sisterinlaw gifted this gem to me for my bday and id only had it one other time in my life  2008 when these folks first made it and my palate being much more developed now i can appreciate how good it is its like a fine bold red wine meets tart and dark cherry juice meets orval  super complex lots of cherry and oak some funk spritzy like a champagne though not that much so and absolutely no way to tell that its 105 abv phenomenal and highly recommended for any oud bruin fan out there
3845,The Dissident,4.36,this is a 2016 five full years in the cellar have worked magic with this exceptional ale too bad i dont have a fresh one right now to try it against  the difference is phenomenal super smooth and mellow much less sour but a bit more funky more juicy dark fruit
3846,The Dissident,4.04,a 1 pint 6 fl oz waxed bomber 2015 reserve with a best after date of 30th october 2016 poured into a holy mountain tulip glass  appearance a mostly clear amber brown colour with a one finger beige head that had decent retention and left some nice lacing  aroma tart cherry vinous light acetone oak caramel notes and a touch of vinegar  taste lightly sour and tart cherry red grape plum vinous oak caramel light boozy  mouthfeel medium bodied with moderate carbonation  overall abv was higher than expected although the waxed bottle probably should have hinted in that direction there was a slight boozy feel but despite that it was still smooth enjoyable and easy to drink
3847,The Dissident,4.13,four year old bottle  nearly flat beer murky brownish color  wonderful nose moderately sour with tons of oak vinegar tannins lemon and cherry  flavor follows although it shows the age and oxidation much more than the nose surprising perhaps given that part of the mystique around a wax cap is that it should help prevent oxidation flavor profile is otherwise the same as the nose along with notes of peach and leather  unbelievably drinkable for the high abv it drinks like a sour at 5075 of the abv
3848,The Dissident,4.5,22 oz bottle 2015 vintage poured into a snifter at 50 degrees f l  brownred with an off white head that lingered at the edges of the glass s  cherries oak t  medium funk on the nose then cherries and oak with wine tannins on the finish f  light mouthfeel with medium carbonation o  complex and interesting beer very good
3849,The Dissident,4.21,500ml bottle into a tulip 2019 reserve  looks interesting in the glass deep deep hazy amber body with good carbonation replenishing a creamy foamy slightly off white head this head persists throughout impressive given the abv layers of lacing  aroma of tart cherry a little wine some wood manages to smell sour  on tasting the sour and tart notes bounce off each other making for a pleasing blend cherries are evident but not strong or luscious a little apple at times its warm but the abv seems less than advertised  mouth between medium and full finish is a mouth puckering tart and sour mix with a cherry presence  overall one of the better sours ive had sour and tart mix sits very nicely on this palate
3850,The Dissident,4.5,pours a lightish red colour with a medium tan head and left quite a bit of lacing on my glass  smells of cherry oak barrel some light ethanol and kind of like a sour vinegar smell  taste follows the nose but is even better lots of tart cherry and general dark fruit character booziness is less pronounced theres this nice light funk present from start to finish thats more toned down than the brett version but quite pleasant alcohol still comes through more than id like but its not terrible the tartness balances the sweetness and the malt character really ties everything together  mouthfeel is mediumfull with lots of grippy tannins  edit i came back to this a year after my first taste and now that my palette has developed a bit i love this one more than ever absolute must try im surprised that i think this was worth the money since its on the pricier side but this is definitely going in my regular rotation
3851,The Dissident,5,was given this as a gift for fathers day opened it on christmas eve  it didnt disappoint an amazing cross between wine and beer only side project approaches this 
3852,The Dissident,4.85,drink it like an expensive wine enjoy it slowly but dont let it get warm
3853,The Dissident,4.21,sampled in a taster glass from draft at whole foods market on december 5 2019 reminds me of goudenband
3854,Red Poppy Ale,4.49,im not usually the biggest fan of sour beers but this one is exactly hits the jackpot where it is sour but not too sour some brett funk mixed with the acidity of the cherries makes this an excellent beer for the fall season after a nice hike into the woods
3855,Red Poppy Ale,4.27,tart cherry flavor with good carbonation 2 finger lasting head
3856,Red Poppy Ale,4.35,1900 name red poppy brewery the lost abbey location san marcos style barrelaged wild ale abv 65 date i have searched for this beer for quite a while i stumbled upon it about two years ago climbing to 1900 reviews should be something special to drink i have been wanting to drink this and cable car using a tulip glass i served the beer at around 48 degrees the pour created an offwhite frothy onefingered head with poor retention the quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass looking at the murky color in the cup i would chart it around srm 26 dark rusty brown the appearance is about average for this style nosing the glass i smell barnyard cherries horse blankets fruity sweetness acidic acid wine oak and a fruity tartness i taste tart jammy cherries barnyard funk straw oak acidic acid winey slight fruity sweetness herbal lightly floral and yeasty the mouthfeel is puckering and tart finishing dry the body is medium with a mediumplus carbonation this is a fantastic beer the cherries are bright vibrant and tart with a wild yeasty flair this could be too much pucker power for some people but i find it delightful i would love a few more bottles of this and let it age for several years to see if the pucker power is tamed overall great beer glad i got to consume it
3857,Red Poppy Ale,4.02,2013 vintage  the nose is fantastic oak  jammy cherry puckering the palate hits with sour cherry medium tannin and dry oak carbonation is completely gone which is a shame without it that acid comes on a little too strong opened to honor our daughter poppy
3858,Red Poppy Ale,4.26,2022 vintage can to wine glass  l pours a minimally reddish muddy brown with a foamy beige head that leaves plenty of lacing lots of fine floaters  s ripe sour cherries and poppy seeds yeasty funky and slightly vinegary  t the sweeter notes are less present than in the smell but they are definitely there in a fresher form tart yeasty and very earthy hints of fruity red wine  f quite soft and smooth despite its strong carbonation  o very good american take on a classic belgian style fresh and fruity with the barrel coming through really nicely great balance subtle complexity already looking forward to try some older vintages
3859,Red Poppy Ale,4.18,red poppy pours a vibrant ruddy brown color with a massive tan head that dissipates quickly and unevenly producing a shortlived rocky effect thats quite pretty while it lasts before leaving a filmlike cap a thick crown and some spotty strands of lacing  it has a nice aroma of vinegar and cherry with both leather and some slightly creamy notes behind  that great vinegary flanders quality continues to the taste with the edges nicely rounded by the fruit and perhaps by age theres a definite red wine element to it also which provides some depth i enjoy the taste closes with a fairly tart drying finish that lets just a little of the cherry juice linger  the feels medium bodied and soft with soft carbonation  this is a really wellmade beer the cherry doesnt pop as much as say alexander but its a pleasant undercurrent throughout and counteracts the acidity cant really say what the poppy seeds added but they certainly dont detract from the beer in any way  i couldnt find a clear bottling date anywhere on here but theres a raised unobtrusive 19 on the glass making me think thats when the bottle andor beer was made
3860,Red Poppy Ale,2.73,purchased in november 2021 from hopheads in altona on the outer western edge of melbourne in australia drunk in july 2022  pours a bright burgundy colour theres no evident carbonation and no head  the nose is strongly sour cherry and balsamic vinegar there are hints of vanilla the aroma already has my mouth watering but its already presenting as something thats going to be overwhelmingly sour and acidic im not sure im looking forward to it  the taste oh my the taste its bracing its like the first time i had a warhead lolly with an immediate reaction of wow thats sour in fact its extremely sour like a mouthful of sour morello cherries theres also a sharp dry kick at the end as it warms it mellows slightly but develops tannic notes and grape or cherry skin highlights to the point it begins to resemble a red wine but with a residual vinegar aftertaste  the mouthfeel is sharp and its almost stinging on the way down not terribly enjoyable for mine  overall this is too sour and then too much like im drinking a glass of red wine ive read a number of reviews and none seem to mirror the harshness of my experience with the beer which was not an enjoyable one maybe i had a bad bottle or it had been treated poorly before reaching me not sure but i can only go on my evidence  cheers
3861,Red Poppy Ale,3.85,20220508 skinny can served in a little glass  pours dark purplered small head lots of carbonation smell is moderate wood a little cherry skin  taste is tart cherry tannic some fruit skin bitterness  mouthfeel is light overall pretty good
3862,Red Poppy Ale,4.43,pours a ruddy amber auburn light aroma with a faint cherry tinge lightly tart sharply effervescent completely delicious tried this with at least a year and change on it possibly a lot longer held up well
3863,Red Poppy Ale,4.6,not able to try lost abbey often but this was gifted me in a recent cancans bif so i got to try it mixed reaction glad to be drinking it bummed i cant go to the store and buy any around here but thats not a review poured from 12 oz stovepipe can into a stemless teku glass color brown like a strongly brewed iced tea but the tan head that quickly builds and faded to mere lacing assures me this isnt tea the aroma is definitely cherry forward but backed by malts of unknown origin unexpected but very pleasant taste leaves everything i experienced with this beer in the rear view tart cherries strongly edge a malty base and combine in a way ive never experienced in a sour before really something and really good feel is tingly but not from carbonation crisp and smooth how thats simultaneously done i may never know good beer bummed its only 12 oz now
3864,The Abyss,3.64,l  look is black like coffee bu with little head s smell isnt potent smoky stout t  the taste is of course the stand out very complex very bitter and earthy possibly the most earthy stout ive ever had i personally enjoy more sweet stouts where this is very very bitter and woody however i believe the complexity and richness speaks to the craft and would be absolutely loved by some f  feel is slightly bubbly and thick o  as stated i want to like it but its not quite sweet enough for my tastes and its extreme earthiness is beyond my pallet that said its enjoyable and worth a try
3865,The Abyss,4.96,aged leather gives way to notes of strong dark licorice there are notes of burnt marshmallow in there as well as a taste of either ripe plums or fresh mediterranean figs with an abv of over 11 this beer does not come off as overly boozy despite its aging in bourbon and french oak barrels finally there is a finish of sarsaparilla and milky molasses  this beer will only get better with age i see this beer as mellowing its edges with another year or two if you can wait that long on the shelf aging
3866,The Abyss,4.91,awesome
3867,The Abyss,4.06,unsure of the 99 rating wasnt impressed a year ago and not impressed a year after proper aging dark chocolate and leather are present but there is a burnt characteristic to this that just turns me off some astringency as well interested to see 1 more year of aging on this to see what happens otherwise there are plenty of other barrel aged stouts out there i find to be much more preferable
3868,The Abyss,4.34,drinking a 2018 bottle cellared this ris has a roasted malt or grain characteristic which sets it apart from some of the others it is not a sweet beer with lots of cherries plums or fruits rather it is a dry dark and burnt character leaning towards tartbitter end of the scale for me it is like a dry ris i like it more of the bitter chocolate and coffee end of the spectrum it is mellow and not boozy for me mouth feel is medium and not too chewy just right actually looks like motor oil from an old v8 that has not been drained in 20k miles reaching for my 2nd one just now this is a quality product from deschutes
3869,The Abyss,4.28,2017 reserve bottled on 101317 pulled this bottle out my cellar was not sure what to expect butit is still tasting great i suspect that the wax over the bottle cap along with the hefty abv helped pours jet black with a frothy coffee colored head some slight hints of this beers age come through in the nose but not enough to be offensive as many other reviews state there is a lot going on in this offering every sip offers up a new flavor or aroma that i did not pick out in the previous the barrel aged flavor complements this beer instead of overpowering it the nose is the only hint that this beer has just over 5 years on it overall an enjoyable and complex imperial stout
3870,The Abyss,4.11,12oz bottled 42821 nearly one year ago poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 118 abv per label the beer pours pitch black with no light penetration and light brown head the head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of tiny bubbles sparce lacing the aroma is moderate in strength featuring chocolate roasted malt and oak barrel the taste is bittersweet roasted malt with more subtle oak bitter chocolate and a moderately bitter finish the mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a mostly dry finish the substantial abv is well hidden overall very good
3871,The Abyss,4.27,no head smell is rich dark chocolate cherry hints of coffee and bourbon lots going on in the mouth upfront cherry milk and dark chocolate hoppy pine bitterness caramel oak char coffee on the finish and a bit more hops the barrel is there though it doesnt dominate feel is thick and smooth the kind of beer that you can mull over and find all sorts of different things

3877,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.24,great value bang for buck coffee coffee coffee this is a load of coffee in a beer not to thick cant taste alcohol pretty delicious for 10 a six pack

3879,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),4.15,if you were a fan as i was of the 2021 oktoberfest from sn couldnt get the 2022 you will be disappointed with this most recent version dont get me wrong its a nice little beer just nowhere the same more hops less caramel less body less mouthfeel different style i encourage others to try just one bottlecan and decide for yourself before expecting this beer to live up to its once great reputation
3880,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),4.02,canned 7232023  appearance  golden amber body with white head  smell  toasted grain biscuit  taste  malty biscuit dough toasted grain hint of honey  mouthfeel  medium bodied medium plus carbonation slight malt sweetness upfront snappy hops on the back end  overall  this is a rock solid version of a festbier easy drinking and enjoyable  certainly worth a try  price point  299 12 oz can
3881,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),4.03,appearance clear gold big head  smell hay mild sweetness  taste mild sweetness honeyed bread then a little hoppy spiciness more bread and light spice maybe some hay notes nice drinking with medium body not too filling  overall a very nice octoberfest wiesn beer i much prefer this style over marzen style this is a little spicyhoppy but thats fine with me a very good beer to my taste buds
3882,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),2.16,ugh buy something else this is the worst oktoberfest i have ever had i will never buy it again if i could return it to the store i would its that bad
3883,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),2.06,smell beer look its in a can taste yuck its an ipa pour down the drain
3884,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),3.25,copper in color smells  tastes hoppy after reading the description of the beer the punch of hops was their goal but i think its too hoppy for an octoberfest beer style
3885,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),3.73,had oktoberfest festbier 2023 poured from 12oz can bottom stamped pkgd 072423 into tall seidel  pours deep almost copper gold with clarity and 1finger foamy offwhite head which quickly dissipates to a persistent film leaving little lace mild grassy and floral hop and biscuit malt aromas off pour with the biscuit growing and the hops lessening as warms on tasting begins mild sweet biscuit malt which carries a ways into a very little tart stone fruit and then into a drying clean slightly floral neutrally bitter finish  long sweet malty pull with just enough hop flavor and bite in the finish to remind you to enjoy the several youre gonna pound
3886,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),3.83,ltwo fingered frothy headed festbier with a golden amber body nice and lively carbonation as well stoasted malts bready and buttery cracker combined with sweet grain caramel honey apple juice pear and molasses is there as well ta sweet grainy wheaty and slightly spicy flavor nice and malt forward that expresses notes of sweet apple and honey nice bitter finish fwhat youd expect crisp and refreshing ooverall a really solid festbier that gets me in the mood for oktoberfest and the cooler months to come this would go great with some schnitzel or bratwurst i would absolutely have this again
3887,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),3.25,the pour is straw colored with a head of foam that dissipated quicker than i expected but the carbonation is looking lively in my beer mug the taste is white bread grains faint earthy hop presence faint lemon along with a touch of floral near the finish all in all this beer is too bitter to be called a festbier but its okay cheers b
3888,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),4.58,what a pleasant surprise i usually dont go for seasonal beers but i picked up a 6 pack from the limited selection of a local convenience store this is an easy drink rich enough to enjoy with a meal and light enough to have 2 or 3
3889,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),3.29,poured into pint glass had gold orange brown colors got ample foamy head that lingered for a few minutes left some lacing aroma was pleasant got some caramel malt with noticeable lemony presence of hops sipping produced front end of the malt and quickly followed by a strong influence of the hops aftertaste was dry bitter a bit too much for my liking put me in the camp of this beer is unique for a festbier this beer doesnt meet bas listed expectations for an oktoberfest beer but for what it is not a bad brew
3890,Ghost In The Laboratory,4,this was good but didnt meet my expectations this is a local brewery and love a bunch of their stuff this beer is a legendary beer im sure its amazing on tap but i havent had the opportunity to try it yet looks like their was a bad batch that went around with a bunch of particulate last batch i had was citrusy and dank wasnt amazing
3891,Ghost In The Laboratory,4.24,it was super hoppy almost like the hop resin was squeezed out of the buds and into the glass it was very cloudy looking smelled and tasted like grapefruit sour orange juice lemon melon tropical fruit wet hops biscuit yeast a lot of herbal notes and heavy floral notes it was viscous and each sip felt like there was chunks from the bottom of the can on my tongue it was good but not as smooth as most beers by equilibrium
3892,Ghost In The Laboratory,4.35,got a four pack of this beer this past weekend during a day trip to austin the people at the beer shop were very nice  poured from a can into a tulip glass bright hazy yellow color with creamy off white head and good curtain lacing bright citrus and tropical fruit smell and taste pineapple orange and lime was expecting a bit fuller smoother feelnice hoppy finish i really want to have this beer on tap
3893,Ghost In The Laboratory,2.52,i expected a lot more from equlibrium and from a 95 rated world class dipa its cloudy and filled with particulate not by itself a dealbreaker it smells of green papaya and dank lemon not my favorite but promising but it tastes like orange juice left to ferment on its own in the back of your refridgerator its overwhelmingly dank and pithy dry and bitter not at all an enjoyable experience to my palate this is the first dipa ive had that really gave me that sort of crushed up aspirin profile ive heard people talk about before mouthfeel is fine but the texture is literally scrubbed away by intensely dry dank bitterness if thats your cup of well beer then be my guest but wow this is not for me
3894,Ghost In The Laboratory,3.61,poured 1 week old crowler glug glug glug poured thickly with a creamy head that retreated quickly leaving a sudsy lacing my nose aint working so today i dont smell anything taste guava melon dankness bitterness not bad overall not stellar
3895,Ghost In The Laboratory,4.46,16oz can poured out a cloudy golden orange color with a goodsized offwhite head of foam it left sudsy trails of lace on the glass it smelled of guava orange grapefruit caramel sweetness and resin so much tropical fruitiness with toasted caramel  toffee sharp bitterness
3896,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,3.09,drank straight from the bottle nose is full skunk with some rice no alcohol burn or bitterness went down easy little to no aftertaste its decent but didnt really leave an impression other than funkiness
3897,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,2,just another generic rice beer it has a bright yellow appearance the aroma smells like slightly burnt rice the taste is much the same as a budweiser or any other rice based lager
3898,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,3.2,12oz green bottle stamped 2731 1755 poured into a vintage pint glass at fridge temp 48 abv label says its brewed and bottled at matt brewing ny the beer pours bright very pale gold with off white head the head recedes to a pencil thin ring and island leaving rings of lacing after each sip the aroma is skunk hay and light malt in that order the taste is semisweet slightly skunky with a hint of malt and hay minimal bitterness the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish overall ok rice beer
3899,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,3,skunky
3900,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,1.86,put off trying this one for a while because the bottle suggests over compensation was likely one of the worst tasting beers ive ever had in my life from a bottle somewhere in the ballpark of tsintao but none of the clean qualities  had a dirty taste closer to animal urine would probably be a more useful weapon in a barfight than addition in an esky
3901,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,3.2,l poured a pale gold with a frothy white 2 finger head that quickly disappears leaving be hind a thin white cap and little lacing on the glass  s lightly hoppy aroma with a little spice  t peppery hop taste with no malt flavor to back it up  f smooth and lightly tingly on the tongue easily quaffable no alcohol burn  o easy to drink several in one sitting much preferred over tsing tao not as dry as asahi overall not bad for a rice beer
3902,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,3.76,maybe a bad batch but the flavors were super muted and didnt pop like a normal trill beer
3903,Just Outstanding IPA,4.29,canned 040722 a maltier and darker ipa than i expected but still delicious ive never had their citra dipa but i imagine this is a near polar opposite rich caramel malt complement the earthy hops a nice change of pace
3904,Just Outstanding IPA,4.29,just outstanding canned 050322 looks super good rich orange hazy with a big thick head smells of fruit citrus and malt the taste is really nice with the apricot like flavor only hints of citrus and clove that finishes slightly dry and bitter overall a very nice ipa from california and my beloved raulmondesi thanks for sharing
3905,Just Outstanding IPA,4.25,getting back to basics the american ipa has never celebrated bitterness better than in its west coast varieties kern rivers take on the substyle is just bitter just dry just clean and just refreshing all in all its just outstanding  so just outstanding ipa gets going with a bubbly pour of hazy golden and orange hues as its frothy white cap tops the rim the common but clean and sharp fragrance of citrus botanicals spruce and peppery hops create a nearly citronella character on the nose simple and sweet in its malt profile the beers early taste is redolent with lighter versions of caramel honey toasted nuttiness and crust in a slight granola kind of way  as the hops unfold on the middle palate the simply blossom with citrus flavor branchripe tangerine coupled with ruby red grapefruit and the brightness of lime and a juicy impression of citrus evolve a background of pineapple and lighter mango add a rounded fruitiness to the hops for a complex and flavorful balance as the malt influences starts to dissolve off the tongue the juiciness of citrus fades and its bitterness begins to take its place providing strong impressions of pine sap fruit peels peppery grasses and herbs and an overall botanical ginlike counterpart once the alcohol flavors arrive  medium bodied and trending lighter dry crisp and highly refreshing the relatively errorfree ipa is a remarkably brewed ipa thats a standout in a crowded ipa market finishing snappy and lingering with bitterness the session concludes with a comforting hop bite
3906,Just Outstanding IPA,4.4,16 ounce can into plastic cup in my orange tustin hotel room canned on 21122 pours very hazy golden amberlight orange color with a 1 finger dense and creamy off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thin cap that lasts dense soapy lacing down the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation aromas and flavors of big red grapefruit tangerine pineapple apricot mango honeydew melon passion fruit berries citrus peelrind wood pepper pine wheat bread dough herbal floral grass and yeast earthiness lightmedium pine citrus peelrind herbal floral grassy spicy bitterness on the finish medium carbonation and mediumplus body creamybready malts some sticky hops and light resins in the mouthfeel soft finish with lingering resin dryness and no hop astringency minimal warming 68 or hop burn after the finish amazing simcoe and amarillo profile super juicy hops with some dank and earthy notes and a soft hazy malt backbone loved the hop profile as expected
3907,Just Outstanding IPA,4.37,very bold color nose and flavors pours darker than most ipas with a tanned color head was white that disappeared into nice lacing nose is malty with piney taste bittery and lots of malt very nice change from the typical ipa
3908,Just Outstanding IPA,4.22,a very good option for a traditional american ipa beautiful orange body with a great head and lacing smell is a bit light with a hint of maltiness in the middle and citrus at the back taste is good albeit uneven it packs a juicy front but dissipates quickly feel is exactly where it should beits full in the front and middleeven as it fades a bick quickly it is exactly what it should be
3909,90 Minute IPA,4.82,perfect example of an ipa  one of the best mainstream ipas out there
3910,90 Minute IPA,4.89,whats not to like amazing flavors mouthfeel and great abv a truly enjoyable beverage
3911,90 Minute IPA,5,type ipa taste intense balanced and hopforward color deep amber  a standout example of the ipa style pours a deep amber intense and well balanced strong hop blends pine citrus and resinous hops memorable impression one of my favourites
3912,90 Minute IPA,4.72,i came across this on a recent rail tour of the us its available in the cafe car on most of amtraks long distance services it looks like theres no requirement to state the abv of beers at the point of sale as i didnt realise it was 9 til i had the first sip lovely stuff though sadly not available in the uk
3913,90 Minute IPA,5,one of my favorite dipa ish ipas it has a wonderful full bodied dipa taste but doesnt hit you like a higher alcohol ipa i love the higher ibu that seems to be lacking in many ipas these days
3914,90 Minute IPA,3.1,look sap color orange smell hoppy malty slightly citrusy and piney hop taste piney hop rindpithe malt some sweetness in there slight bitterness that starts to build up but then just kinda doesnt if that makes any sense feel nice full boy low carbonation the feel of this beer might be my favorite thing about it overall pretty crushable fairly tame nothing too offensive that being said nothing stands out but i suppose you could also say that just means its well balanced not my cup for ipas but good  poured from a can on clearance that expires in 4 months so i def think this needs a revisit with a fresh brew
3915,90 Minute IPA,3.11,pours an opaque rusty orange thin collar of head with good retention and no lacing nose is sappy hops and malt low grade maple syrup cooked barley and kasha honey sticks taste essentially follows  malts are sweet honey maple sap while the hops impart a pretty tame bitterness and light spice mouthfeel despite the sweetness and heft isnt too heavy while the carbonation stays light 90 minute tastes like an ingredient to me  it has a distinct taste sweet spicy sappy honey  that might make up the main seasoner in a muffin or a sweet bread on its own however its a little too overpowering to be enjoyable i remember 90 minute being this huge outlier when it came out and weirdly it still is in terms of its flavor profile among imperial ipas
3916,90 Minute IPA,4.53,very smooth almost chewy my 1st time with this world class ipa today and i am impressed the alcohol is there and you should be prepared for it but overall the taste smell finish and mouth feel was excellent
3917,90 Minute IPA,4.59,from sicilianos market in grand rapids  had several times but now a few years  will not wait that long again pours a clear orange amber colour with slightly tawny coloured head that replenishes nicely with a little swirl nose is at once hoppy with citrus rind tangerine a touch of tropical fruit and floral aroma  but solidly malty with a subtle caramel note taste is a barrage of hops  piney citrus orange pineapple and marmalade with a bitterness that is tamed by the sweet toasted malt with hints of caramel and honeysuckle a sticky slightly resinous full mouthfeel finishes this with a coating bittersweetness
3918,90 Minute IPA,4.81,easily my favorite imperial ipa and possibly ipa period  pours a beautiful crystal clear amber color with a tanwhite head that long persists as a rim  aroma is very strongly floral and earthy  despite being rated as 90 ibus this is not a bitter beer thanks to the adequate amount of malt being added to balance the hops the flavor is citrusy and earth with a crisp finish making this an easy drinking beer despite its high abv  really just the ideal poster child for the style of ipas as a whole
3919,90 Minute IPA,4.21,12 ounce bottle poured into a snulip best by 72023  l clear amber two fingers of antiquewhite head the persistent foam leaves lace s kind of a malty aroma with notes of citrus and pine t earthy hops with less citrus than the nose but grapefruit and pine medium sweet malt herbal tea note nice malthop balance moderate bitterness spikes at the finish f medium body moderate carbonation smooth frothy feel peppery finish o very drinkable balanced well done classic style dipa
3920,Hite,4.13,i always have this crisp golden smooth and sweet malty lager at the kbbqs
3921,Hite,2.95,light and easy drinking with hints of sweetness even a bit of lemonlime soda on the nose that reflect in the taste as well one of those not a lot to laud or complain about
3922,Hite,2.5,330 ml bottle from green peas stavanger abv is 43 crystal clear pale golden colour moderate white head sweetish aroma of pilsener malts grass and maize light bodied citric mouthfeel sweet and citric flavour notes of grass and maize again a modest bitterness
3923,Hite,2.67,drink it cold as cold as you can get this pours clear minimal aroma bland fizzy flavor quick finish this comes in cans bottles and even plastic bottles so thats something
3924,Hite,2.93,this is not a great beer not even really a good one but i love it for some reason i always seem to have a case of it in the house its bland and boring has no real taste to it but its another beer thats fantastic on a hot day if you want hops or anything beyond the malt and rice this is going to be very disappointing but taken for what it is the sk rendition of budweiser i kind of dig it
3925,Hite,2.82,drink this a lot back in old days in korea because i was a college student with tight budget typical but blend pale lager and it is easy to drink gives you refresh feelings does not have rich aroma lack of body even nowadays in korea this beer isnt for savoring but to mix with soju making higher alcohol content which is called somac soju  macjubeer so korean people who tend to enjoy binge drinking can get drunk easily few weeks ago i went to local vietnamese restaurant and they had this beer for their beer menu it gives me nostalgic feeling but skipped and ordered tiger from singapore i would drink hite beer again if i only meet my good old friends from high school or college at neighborhood tavern
3926,Double Citra¬Æ,4.59,a textbook citra showcase aroma is orange marmalade grapefruit zest juicy tangerine and a hint of grass taste gives juicy tangerine and pulpy  zesty grapefruit slightly grassy and just a hint of malty sweetness on the finish medium body with moderate carbonation foamy mouthfeel turns into a creamy finish high drinkability
3927,Double Citra¬Æ,4.28,slightly malty tropical hoppy and a subtle orange citrus nose on this one taste follows with some sweet and floral orange citrus maltysweetness a kiss of briny minerality and a subdued hoppy bitter finish as this was canned on 41823 consumed on 6723 i had this while it was a little long in the toothbut you can tell that this was absolutely fantastic when fresh this is still wellmade and delicious
3928,Double Citra¬Æ,4.9,165 yum
3929,Double Citra¬Æ,4.53,pour at de garde 10th anniversary hazy golden pour thin white foamy head citrusy aroma grapefruit and some piney hops taste is fruity and citrusy hops getting a bit more dank hop resin smooth full body another stellar ipa from hill farmstead
3930,Double Citra¬Æ,4.26,deep orange and semitransparent nose is stone fruit and slight resin taste is very peach and mango forward w a little malt for balance brief lingering bitterness crisp clean mouthfeel
3931,Double Citra¬Æ,4.47,3 months old can to wine glass  l pours an opaque golden orange with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing plenty of tiny floaters visible  s grassy piney and slightly citrusy  t very hoppy subtle notes of citrus as well as tropical fruits paired with piney and grassy notes medium sweetness medium bitterness  f highly drinkable with a medium carbonation minimally sticky  o very complex in a subtle way and overall a very good beer interestingly its not as citrusforward as many other single hop citra ipas instead its rather piney with a touch of west coast in it great craftsmanship as always from hf
3932,Red Dog,5,dont understand why score so low loved this beer when i could find it here in the south
3933,Red Dog,2.32,wasnt aware this was still in production certainly havent seen it in nh in decades we would occasionally dip into these for a change from the other equally swill beers of the day rarely ever able to afford budweiser
3934,Red Dog,1.5,12oz can cant say no to free beer but maybe you should sometimes my fatherinlaw bought this because it had a dog on the label that might have been the best feature
3935,Red Dog,3.9,12 oz can apr 2020 bought cold single at local basic liquors poured into a 14 oz mug  l inchhigh foam on pour sitting atop a polishedclear brasscolored liquid the foam is actually relatively dense and glossy receding surprisingly slow holds a halfmoon crescent collar and dang if there isnt 34 thick bands of lace  huh  s very pale almost flourlike vaguely cornflaky grain smell dominates mellow toasted note mildly grassyherbal overtone  t apple juicy ester up front with a sudden surge of cereallike again corn flakes dried grassyearthy grain midway finishes rather dry with a mild lingering pils malt husk note maybe a slight background tinge of masa moderately bitter for its ilk  f certainly a vibrant effervescence bubbling and rumbling the center of each sip with a few healthy belches as proof the body itself is on the meatier side of light  o first time having this in perhaps 25 years last time being likely a lukewarm can awash in a sea of melting ice in a cooler at a gathering in the woods or one of my other many haunts had no recollection of this being a miller product but given my inclination toward their brands i could honestly see getting this again even just maybe a 30 pack ive seen em 1722
3936,Red Dog,3.08,pours a translucent gold like any other aal with a white head that dissipates immediately smells like wet grain with a touch of just enough hops to let you know its not a light beer taste is surprisingly better than most with a less apparent adjunct presence than other macros this one shines because it doesnt lie its uncommonly smooth this goes down maybe even easier than water overall an exceptional aal but ive only seen it once get it if you can
3937,Red Dog,1.85,overall shit
3938,Red Dog,2.46,our dog came back we rescued him we thought he was gone but we got him back its the beer that your dad crushed at dive bars and boson garden its the classic 90s beer and we got it back red dog is it good no not particularly easy drinking honestly probably one of the better miler products again not really sure what that says but this beer was bought for the story the brand
3939,Red Dog,4.94,red dog is a great budget beer goes down smooth and taste pretty darn good great poker beer
3940,Red Dog,3.69,great cheap beer
3941,Red Dog,5,red dog is the shit 30 pack from roger wilco in pennsauken was about 2100 looks great smells amazing tastes even better and then it feels so good red dawg –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–π—Å—è
3942,Red Dog,2,better than a lot of ice beers that is not saying much this is still awful in almost every way shape and form the only thing that separates this is that it actually tastes somewhat like beer
3943,Ann,4.95,fantastic
3944,Ann,4.84,2015 batch which i think is batch 3 bottle pour from hill farmstead brewery in greensboro vt  this one pours a fairly clear golden orange color with a small head and a bit of lacing  this smells like lemon peel tea honey grassy funk white wine pear skin melon riesling and a minerally funk  this is my biggest white whale the beer i have most wanted to try since first trying hill farmstead originally 10 years ago its tremendous just about as good as it gets for saison but it wasnt even the best beer i had from hill farmstead on my recent trip thats how high the bar is for this longtime favorite brewery of mine this has soft subtle and richly complex flavor to it theres the obvious honey almost like honeysoaked pears or something like that with white wine riesling grapes melon apricot jam and a floral and minerally funk all of these flavor descriptions make it seem like its a super strong and intense beer  it really isnt its really delicate and rewards slower sipping and enjoying  this is light bodied soft almost creamy with a wonderful drinkability its well carbonated but in a subtle way  this might not be the exact top of the mountain for hill farmstead  thats probably samuel or one of the sara residency beers but this is pretty close to the top and a perfect expression of an already great beer in anna
3945,Ann,4.27,on tap at finleys pub in denver very good for the style
3946,The Rusty Nail,4.46,poured from 22oz waxed bomber into a tulip this is the 2023 vintage release this version is 141 i had this beer ages ago when it first came out but im just getting around to reviewing it now  appearance dark as a moonless night with a starless sky impenetrable head is a thin layer of tan foam that could be a little nicer  smell cinnamon right up front but with enough vanilla from the bourbon and a dash of licorice to really give the feeling of a sweet bread i mean this thing is as sweet as summer days are long but the overall vibe is great big hug from a panader√≠a and i am very much into it  taste sweet of course but with a very bakerylike sensibility as in the aroma the licorice and alcohol give the otherwise sweet cinnamonroll flavor a more mature dimension i really love the complexity of flavor and juxtaposition of elements here its diabetes in a bottle but hey i dont really need these feet  mouthfeel rich body with a good carbonation and a smooth satisfying creaminess maybe not perfectly silky but damn fine  overall the drinkability for a 141 ba stout is truly astounding this beer is a sugar bomb im really going to have some explaining to do after my next a1c evaluation however that doesnt mean this beer isnt goooooood
3947,The Rusty Nail,4.11,yet another time to be alive pour this one also came during the tap takeover for beernv right before the alabama show at lake tahoe this was the 2022 version  pours black even though its the same color as a stout i expected greater viscosity didnt amass much of a head some brown cherry cola like head but it was thin 16 blew a hole down the middle the aroma didnt yield much in the way of roasted malt it put a much heavier influence on the barrels sweet bourbon andor whiskey notes dominate  the taste gets a little more complex perhaps its the stuff i loathe like licorice or cinnamon bark actually making a yield that is more enjoyable than the sum of its parts the mouth feel isnt hot or bitter like i was expecting its a real smooth showcase for a pretty big beer but it doesnt have that challenging edge that extreme advocate seems to desire  its a pretty nice big beer and i dont like big beers that much lately
3948,The Rusty Nail,4.48,i havent had a tetanus shot in a while and the nail might be rusty but im still going for it like hemet kumar lying on a bed of them to get his chill on i am straight feeling this its balanced and nasty at the same time and im talking good nasty to you needs out there  anyway life was meant to be had lets go
3949,The Rusty Nail,4.28,poured from a 2022 twenty two ounce bottle with neither head nor lacing and little carbonation starless and bible black in color  the nose features the barrel and a wee bit of malty char pleasant but unremarkable  the taste reveals the licorice and cinnamon bark they pair nicely and do not dominate as i feared im wary of cinnamon in beer but the deft hand of the brewers keeps things in harmony  mouthfeel is luxurious and finish is barrel not too hot but the booze is felt theres enough carbonation to satisfy
3950,The Rusty Nail,4.7,poured into a snifter  dark black pour not quite jet black but very dark lite lacing appearing getting aromas of malts cinnamon chocolate molasses bourbon tastes follow the nose with a very rich sweetness behind this burnt brown sugar cinnamon chocolate licorice dark fruits such as cherries figs apricots slight coffee and bourbon feel is medium to medium heavy not to thick oily very good feel sipper very easy sipper overall this is a very great beer and i can see why its ranked number one on here easily the best oatmeal barrel aged stout ive had cheers
3951,The Rusty Nail,4,2017 vintage bottle consumed on 2423 at a bottle share held up quite well drank velvety smooth and had good flavours of which cinnamon was picked up the most with light licorice notes
3952,The Rusty Nail,4.44,12152019
3953,The Rusty Nail,4.88,look black with the thinnest of brown heads very viscous  smell barrel chocolate malty dark fruit  taste follows the nose chocolate and fruit on the front followed by malt and barrel  feel super viscous with just a hint of carbonation
3954,The Rusty Nail,4.6,looks as youd expect dark  opaque little carbonation or head nose is complex with licorice cocoa cinnamon  a smokey note taste follows nose with cherries added  a wee bit of bourbon barrel mouthfeel is thick due to smoked barley  oats luscious really cherries are quite bright in the finish a very well balanced stout
3955,The Rusty Nail,4.56,pours ink black and no discerning head chocolate pastryspice smooth chocolate and cinnamon and also licorice medium feel and smooth long finish flavors work wonderfully together at 55 deg and while warming up

3957,Kriek De Ranke,3.25,mostly acidic really cherry barely come through to me slight funky farmhouse smell
3958,Kriek De Ranke,4.01,bottle from mail order sampled at a couple of years old lightly hazy deep brick red in color with a bubbly off white head that had to be coaxed rich earthy funk and plenty of lemony lactic and a huge helping of sour tart cherries lightly gritty mouthfeel but a fine beverage imho

3960,Kriek De Ranke,4.16,750ml bottle into a teku glass best before 09032023  pours a hazy strawberry red color with a fairly large fizzy pink head that dissipates quickly down to nothing carbonation appears huge aromas of berry jam pale malts subtle funk tart red fruits including of course cherry but also strawberry theres a uniqueness to the aroma that differentiates its from most lambic perhaps a product of the blending as it appears this is not 100 lambic but a blend with some other base beer regardless i really did the aroma taste is much more sour than the aroma implied balanced by the big berry notes some oak only funk is the burnt plastic kind theres almost no pungent character which i prefer mouthfeel is a bit harsh its just so heavily carbonated its almost hard to drink without belching or getting hiccups never had that happen with a beer before this also somewhat limits its drinkability overall quite a nice beer but lacking when compared to some of the greatest belgium lambic   442542535425
3961,Kriek De Ranke,3.46,750 ml bottle bright red smells of cherries bitter earthy yeast funk and a little oak tastes of earthy yeast notes cherry oak a little dried grass medium body and well carbonated not terribly sour which is nice good all around
3962,Kriek De Ranke,3.95,shared 750 ml bottle at mikkeller bar aarhus red color pinkish offwhite head dryish aroma of sour cherries and farmhouse bone dry flavour with notes of sour cherries and brettanomyces
3963,Kriek De Ranke,4.18,pours a slightly hazy strawberry head big effervescent to start that quickly falls back to a slight ring no retention nose sour cherry red wine red wine vinegar and oak taste is relatively moderate on the sour scale balanced by a bit of sweet cherry there a bit of underlying bitterness midpalate and the oak shines through as well on the finish very refreshing very enjoyable
3964,Kriek De Ranke,4.09,very hazy orange color with a thin foamy head that quickly dissipates no retention or lacing pungent sour tart cherry aroma red wine tart cherry and red wine taste with nice sourness medium bodied with moderate to heavy carbonation 375 4 425 35 425

3966,King Sue,4.71,explosive grapefruit nose after popping the top orangeyellow hazy pour with a loose bubbly head really nice evolution of flavors from opening with orange then tropical fruit followed by a nice grapefruit trex bite for the finish cant wait to get bitten again

3969,Rodenbach Caract√®re Rouge,4.35,750 ml corked  caged bottle from the lcbo best before 02072020 and served slightly chilled this review is mostly for my own personal interest given the fact that its like 3 years past due  pours a foggy reddishburgundy colour with some flaky sediment that eventually settles at the base of the glass nearly an inch of bubbly off whitetinted head dissipates within a matter of minutes a thin collar is the only noticeable remnant potent aromas of cherry juice and raspberries paired with hints of oak baking spice vanilla cranberry and red grapes restrained suggestions of balsamic vinegar and funk  a masterful fusion of sweet red fruit flavours and sour oaked red ale notes  the cherry and raspberry come through first joined by notes of cranberry and red grape shortly thereafter making for a decidedly fruity forefront hints of oak vanilla baking spice and subtle balsamic acidity develop later on with a touch of earthy funk lingering into an aftertaste of cherry pit apples oak and red fruits especially cranberry mediumfull in body with moderate carbonation that feels gentle and frothy smooth soft mouthfeel normally these 750 ml bottles of rodenbach are overkill for a single person but cr is so easy drinking and the abv is so wellintegrated that polishing it off should be no trouble at all  final grade 435 an a grade i honestly dont think caract√®re rouge is the 1 example of its style however theres a strong argument to be made that its the best introductory flemish red available its ample red fruit flavours add a prominent juicysweetness to the profile counteracting the innate sourfunky qualities of the underlying red ale its also worth mentioning that the base ale itself is much less assertively acidic and funky than say rodenbachs grand cru or their vintage series making for a more approachable  drinkable glass of beer though perhaps not as complex still an excellent sour  likely not worth cellaring but based on this experience a properly stored 56 yo bottle will hold up fine highly recommended
3970,Rodenbach Caract√®re Rouge,4.25,375ml bottle cant find a bottling year or bestby date  look beautiful clear ruby red but points subtracted for the visible sediment at the bottom of my half pour basically no head no carbonation visible  smell red wine dark and fruity and tart  taste cherry changing to raspberry with a sweetness that comes and goes the cranberry appears most in the aftertaste not as dry as my nose was expecting in fact its pretty sweet i took this out of the fridge but im not getting the complexity i hoped for  feel a little tingly even though i cant see any bubbles moderate mouthfeel not particularly light or heavy  overall tasty and fun good balance between tart and sweet but i have to admit i was hoping for more i have no idea how old this bottle is or how it has been stored im perfectly willing to believe that a wellstored bottle would have more to say for itself
3971,Rodenbach Caract√®re Rouge,4.34,750ml bottle into a tall glass bottled 2192018 after 30 months on foeders the last 6 resting on cherries raspberries and cranberries  looks good in the glass dark reddish brown body small off white bubbly head fizzes away quite quickly no lacing  splendid mixed berry fruit aroma  on tasting the cherry and raspberry tart sweetness comes through very cleanly before the drink effortlessly moves into a drying sour berry fruit taste  mouth between medium and full finish sour tart and drying with a nice berry residue  overall another suberb flanders red from rodenbach the care and time that goes into producing this beer is worth every penny to this drinker
3972,Rodenbach Caract√®re Rouge,4.68,poured from 750 ml bottle into tulip a pours a clear red amber hue with essentially no head s loads of fresh cherries raspberries and cranberries sour and sweet with a hint of earthy spice and soft oak lovely t closely follows aroma soursweet cherries fresh raspberries and cranberries earthy spice soft oak and subtle belgian yeast m lightmedium body nice balance of sweet and sour soft oak dry throughout lingers nicely on the palate d a superb brew and example of style

3974,Rodenbach Caract√®re Rouge,4.27,appearance pours a tawny amber color with a thin cap that quickly fades to a ringlet dotty lacing  smell oaky with cranberry and cherry tones most prominent hints of vanilla graham cracker and caramel  taste cranberry and tart cherry blend with caramel and graham cracker flavors at the outset with the vanilla and raspberry softening the intial impact oaky and moderately sour through the finish  mouthfeel medium body with very low carbonation  overall this is a older bottle and while full of flavor may have lost some carbonation in cellar terrific flavors however
3975,Rodenbach Caract√®re Rouge,4.74,poured from a 750ml bottle in to a tulip glass  look has a nice clear red color with a short lasting white head  smell smells of berries and slightly sweet also with an acidic touch  taste tastes closely with how it smells although with very little sweetness overall which is a good thing to me for this type of beer  feel slightly fizzy not a heavy beer  overall usually with size of beer im a believer in sharing with someone else to then move on to another but i am always tempted to hog this one will drink it whenever i find available

3978,Stickee Monkee,4.49,12oz bottle 2018 vintage that turned up in my lbs this week poured into a chalice at 47f 114 abv the beer pours opaque medium brown with light brown head the head recedes to a thin ring and little else no lacing the aroma is moderate in strength featuring candi sugar raisin bourbon and leather the taste is semisweet caramel bourbon and brown sugar with lingering tobacco oak and leather on the finish minimal bitterness the mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a semi dry finish abv is well hidden with just a touch of heat on the back end and no ethanol aroma or taste overall excellent
3979,Stickee Monkee,4.16,rare 2015 vintage draught pour at apex bar in portland or presented flat no foam at all deep brown borders on black smells great dark stone fruits and that famiiar quad on the nose taste is toes on the line too sweet but it doesnt become cloying or teethachingly so i think maybe because its 7 years old some if the nuances intended have been lost but the dark brown sugar stewed plums and oak barrel all make appearances throughout the chew feel is very dense quite viscous no carbonation overall good to get a draught hit but 7 years of hiding has worn its beauty down
3980,Stickee Monkee,4.52,2018 vintage poured into a fw mini snifter  dark brown pour with minimal carbonation scents of candi sugar caramel and dried fruit sweet flavor of candy and a warming finish certainly a fine example of the style and one that aged well
3981,Stickee Monkee,4.44,2021 vintage consumed on 10302022  a bit of smoke on the opening of the bottle dark brown pouring with a 2 finger tan head with a fairly aggressive pour the retention is decent and theres some lacing on the glass the aroma is strong with dark fruit  i get a lot of plum and raisin in the nose taste  tons of plum and raisin hit up front theres a hint of caramel and toffee on the back i also get a creamy flavor mixing in almost a lactose flavor this last thing surprised me probably not getting it right the body is very thick and full smooth and very little alcohol burn i love this beer and so glad i bought it
3982,Stickee Monkee,4.22,the beer is mahogany dark brown color the beer fizz with sound while pouring but leaves a thin layer of foam only which disappears very quickly the beer smells dark smoky brown sugar coffee leather molasses and whiskey barrel oaky the wooden oaky barrel aroma is distinct its clearly a barrelaged strong ale  the beer is full bodied velvety latte creamy with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue the beer is moderate sweet its 2016 bottle 6 years later its still not dry with a bold palate with a bit sour tart cherry light bitter and subtle salty at back the taste is great renders the beer bold but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad which should be drier to me the malty backbone is strong and theres dark sugar turbinado brown sugar from mexico added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints when i sip i sense some dark chocolate roasted chestnut nutty alcohol burn salted toffee candy leather and tobacco earthiness whiskey filled chocolate bottle dried fig and raisin aromas the beer taste bold very malty and dark sugar characters but its not ester heavy nor fruity my feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile but just sitting still and sipping cigar this is a malty beverage really malty i think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow i expect more layers in this beer but currently its just a bit too sweet malty to enjoy

3988,Triple (White),4.28,beautiful darker golden color with a fruity and slightly bitter flavor
3989,Triple (White),3.79,enjoyed under the belfry of medieval gent before heading to bruges this foggy burnt gold beer has a very actively tall offwhite foam head  its airy froth belies a dry bite and a punch of peppery phenol before exhaling a little toasted biscuit where too some heat reveals itself

3993,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,3.99,nice whiskey barrel flavors compliment a base ale
3994,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.49,muddy brown strong ale no head whatsoever and absolutely no more disappointment after that great silky mouthfeel vanilla flavor mildly allowing bourbon and even brandy notes to overtake it nice caramel malt finish smooth from top of the glass to the bottom brandy flavor is more at the top bourbon predominant through last sip superior effort
3995,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.27,2009 vintage courtesy of acurtis 12 years old dark fruitsprune raisins toffee leather wood slight oxidization 99 flat no booziness smooth overall though definitely old this ages pretty well those melded flavors only age can produce ages better than most beers out there from what ive read lost abbey was probably flat even when fresh
3996,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.46,the angels share is from 2016 pours dark dark brown almost black very little carbonation during the pour and then a bit after it was all poured immediate aroma of bourbon i was surprised it was so strong after 45 years taste follows  big bourbon presence which makes me happy because i love bourbon barrel aged beers between the color being almost black and the bourbon dominating this is very close to a bourbon barrel aged stout instead of a barleywine if given in a blind tasing i might think it was theres very little barleywine characteristic its not sweet dont get any caramel or toffee its still a bit boozy but i like that in beers like this
3997,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.16,viscous opaque garnetbrown with no head strong bourbon nose with hints of wood cherry stone candy sugar moss plum and oak smoke fig milk chocolate red currants a whisky hit with a big thread of vanilla sweet comeback  warming end mediumfull chewy round  375 45 4 4 425  sat on this for 5 years no looker but smells like a humidor  once you get past the booziness the complexity of the aroma drips down the back of your throat the taste is dried dark fruit more than any caramel sweetness and then that bourbon drops in while among the most harmonious ive encountered it does take over more than complement the base beer not perfect its flat  boozy  hard to avoid at 125 but it shouldve mellowed with age i see lots of good ratings for this but some are a decade old  maybe this beer jumped out more before everything was getting put in barrels overall this has more in common with treacly english strong ales than anything else but with a lot of bourbon  more an advertisement for bourbon barrel aging than a complete beer
3998,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.43,cork didnt want to get out no pop pours dark brown flat smells bourbon smooth mouthfeel but could do with some carb no alcohol to speak of taste is dry woody with some bice bourbon bit herbal that old leather tobacco flavour from good barrels
3999,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.31,vintage 2016 poured into a tulip glass no head to speak of just a full murky ruby brown aromas of figbarrel and caramel taste is similar no hops semblance at this point and that is ok ill give you six dollars if you can name where that quote came from the heft was surprisingly light carbonation low mildly sticky as everything warmed delicious and coating
4000,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.33,vintage 2016 poured from a 375ml corked  caged bottle into a snifter pours light brown but gathers in the glass a bit darker almost chestnut with the tiniest amount of khaki colored head that dissipates leaving small khaki swirls nose is a combination of dark fruit figs toffee chocolate vanilla oak and bourbon taste is a little more oak and bourbon forward followed by sweet toffee and caramel it suffers from a little oxidation but thats my own fault for letting this sit so long mouthfeel is medium to full it sits on the tongue fairly full then finishes a little thinner overall pretty stellar bourbon barrelaged barleywine need to track down a fresh vintage as it was not my intention to try this for the first time with so much age on it very much enjoyed it though
4001,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,1.69,330 ml bottle from the na shelf at vinmonopolet kvadrat very pale golden colour moderate white head strong and sickly aroma of carrots boiled far too long maize baby porridge and unfermented industrial pilsener wort the flavour is not good but not totally undrinkable when the beer is cold at least there are hints of malts and hops
4002,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,2.35,from hipercor in teku glass at lunch with omelette it only has slight traces of the typical unpleasantness of 00 not bothering much while drinking it apart from that complete dullness
4003,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,2.68,beer pours a pale translucent gold capped by two fingers of loose foam that persists for longer than expected but does ultimately recede to a thin layer and then some islands a bit of lacing and a lot of visible carbonation  smell is bready biscuity malt light cracker faint sourness slightly grassy hops bitter greens a touch metallic  taste is slightly sour malt biscuit faint hop bitterness more bitter salad greens slight metallic twang carbonation is high and the body is quite watery but at least there is some hop presence here  ive had worse it doesnt compete with krombacherwhich i would consider the standardbearer of na beersbut its recognizably beery and not outright offensive drink it icecold from the bottle and you might even be able to fool your tastebuds into thinking youre drinking an american light lager
4004,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,1,i wish i could rate this lower  drainpour
4005,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,1.5,
4006,Dark,4.06,can purchased and drank at the alchemist beer caf√© in stowe vt  this one pours a very dark black into the mug with a tight white head and lots of lacing  this smells like toasted malt milk chocolate and dark breadiness  this is really solid and just made to be super drinkable clean and creamy theres a really nice toastiness and breadiness with some roast and lots of chocolate  this is really creamy with a nice full body but a smooth crispness on the back end  the alchemist obviously excels at ipas but this shows their brewing range and versatility
4007,Dark,3.99,pours a deep deep dark brown the brown is only noticeable on the edges when held to light attractive light brown head that has some nice retention it is very cohesive and refrains from clinging to the glass  nose has a slight burnt toastiness to it with some subtle smoke impressions followed by dark fruit  taste follows the nose pretty much to a tee here the main difference for me being the dark fruit note presents itself more prominently becomes more dominant as the glass warms there is a small amount of earthy hops on the finish  light but verging on medium body roasty and dry finish the hops show themselves in feel as well they are present in an almost sappy sort of way on the tongue it is a pleasant addition and adds to the dry finish of this beer  i love almost everything about this beer the body is slight heavy and it just so slightly takes away from its drinkability for me with that being said im still enjoying every sip of this beer its just my one honest critique
4008,Dark,4.35,pours a dark cola color with a tight slightly creamy tan head that provides ample lacing beautiful beer the nose is led by a bit of smoke cocoa notes and a decided floral hop aroma wow  the floral hops are forward and delicious on the taste with the cocoa and subtle roastysmoky flavor at the back of the palate  a dry crisp mouthfeel fits the style nicely and makes this subtly nuanced 55 abv beer from this iconic brewery a true pleasure to drink
4009,Dark,4,how could i pass up the 1 schwarzbier  can at the brewery  roasty chocolate light smoke some bacon very smooth and creamy earthygrassy hops some caramel pretty solid but some of the german offerings are a bit better
4010,Dark,4.29,rocky twofinger beige head relatively light on the lace through the color is rubybrown where bright light passes easily through the center of the glass  mostly chocolate malt aroma i get some semisweet chocolate with a touch of chalkiness theres a the smell of toasted wheat bread in the background attractive it approaches the aroma of a porter but comes up just short good for a schwartzbier  similar to a brown ale but with a little more crispness in the mouth theres a solid hop presence but the dominating flavor is the aforementioned chocolate malt the swallow is a pleasant 6040 blend of the two i get a smidgen of alcohol in the aftertaste which is surprisingly long and chocolatey
4011,Dark,4.36,no canning date purchased at the brewery on 10720 so presumably canned within a week or so of that date consumed on 112920  pours a deep mahoganybloodred hue topped with a towering head of fluffy creamy tan foam good retention leaves a finger of equally creamy cap a massive frothy collar climbing the walls to meet a dense coating of lacing covering the glass  aroma opens with bready malts meeting a firm minerality atop a solidified underlying yeast character and deep floral hop accents hints of milk chocolate come through over the middle before deeper heavily toasted brown breadbread crusts and tones of smoked toffee develop into the close  taste features a dusting of semisweet cocoa contrasting a grassy hop tinge upfront as a yeast profile imbued with delicate malty roast becomes steadily apparent over time floral earthy hops and spent coffee grounds over the midpalate give way to a touch of smoke and nuttiness forming into dry cocoa and ashy char on the finish  mouthfeel brings a mediumlight body with a fluffy higher end carbonation settling to a creamy texture with a subtle oily accent giving way to a steadily encroaching malty grit past the midpalate peaking in dryness on the back end the finish is crisp with malty textures and a delicate bitterness  clean execution at the highest of levels and a commitment to the style in its rawest form a subtle deluge of minerality accents every aspect of this schwarzbier allowing the malt profile to present both cleanly and quietly detailed with a firm hop presence for a deftly executed americanstyled twist
4012,Dark,4,can shared with todd thanks for the opportunity dark brown with faint garnet at the edges and a tightly bubbled tan head that slowly dissipates rich toasty crusty maltiness with hints of chocolate and just enough earthy floral hops to keep it from cloying nice schwartz
4013,Dark,4.71,i love a good schwarzbier and this is without a doubt the best one ive ever had a poured black with some ruby when held up to the light had a fluffy three finger tan head that lingered well a notes of chocolate roasted malt a bit of smoke and nuttiness along with some spice from the hops t rich and layered with chocolate malt sweetness up front along with roasted malts some coffee and some slight bitterness f just sublime with a lingering mineralty that hits the spot the dry finish makes you want to keep drinking o this is one of the best lagers i have had and makes me want to try and get more alchemist sooner than later an amazing beer
4014,Dark,4.24,l black with hints of rubyamber on the edge of the glass thick foamy head dissipates leaving some moderate lacing  s sweet melanoidins and caramel a touch of roast spicy hops and yeast  t robust flavors of caramel and roast good breadiness moderate spice from hops and a clean malty finish  f mediumlight body crisp finish  overall a delicious lager definitely good for anyone craving a dark beer on the lighter side perfect balance of flavors
4015,Dark,4.44,courtesy of brentk56 this is an excellent schwarzbier to have almost completely black schwarz as we germans say with a nice khaki head that has good retention lively carbonation raising to the top supporting this lovely head very smooth and full mouthfeel
4016,Imperial Biscotti Break,3.25,bit of an oj simpson for me dark and bitter
4017,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.53,pours out of the can a midnight blackbrown no light passes through it a nice 2 fingers of tan head with great retention smells of cocoa coffee and roasty malts taste follows the nose fairly well with the coffee being the predominant flavor and the rich mouth feel is like velvet the beer has a perfect carbonation for the style that achieves this sensation im really glad i bought a four pack
4018,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.43,in this rendition its a pint can emptied into a clear imperial pint glass the entire contents fit almost perfectly as theres no extraordinary foam just a modest and enduring dark biege head the color of the liquid is the standard black coffee brown no more no less although the aroma is less than pungent there is some roasted barley to be had but the almond and vanilla additions just dont impress the nose but what a wonderful drink theres the sweet malt of a great stout upfront delivered within an incredibly rich body now the nuances theres coffee but its not overly bitter nor the dominating taste it can be even in good coffee stouts the vanilla only slightly sweetens the brew but contributes as an extra layer not a major taste emphasis almond inclusion adds body and another taste layer without changing the overall and likely adds even more body to a brew certainly not lacking thereof its hard pressed to find a richer bodied stout than this one maybe theres not great glass lacing but other than that this is one of the best 10 abv brews out there the alcohol is warming for sure but not harsh and barely noticeable to taste this is a great member of its style
4019,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.47,l poured from a pint can into a sniffer  inky jet black pour with a huge head risen about 3 fingers length to be exact s getting predominant aromas for vanilla along side with molasses slight roasty coffee chocolate and malt aromas not getting much of the almond in this t getting a complexed mix of vanilla chocolate roasty coffee you can taste the biscuit more so near the after taste of it all getting some after tastes of velvet as well almost similar to a chili brewed stout after taste to this f heavy bodied alcohol hides very well sipper but easy to sip the taste is so smooth and tasty it reminds me of a stout i had that had chili peppers brewed into it o this is a great stout for the price given honestly its complexed but is very rich and easy to drink this one ill be buying again in the near future
4020,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.46,i tried a 10oz glass of this beer off the tapper at dry ground brewing as a guest tap in paducah kentucky it poured an opaque dark with thin tan head that did not leave much lace the scent had dark chocolate and gram cracker notes the taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip there was dark chocolate roast malt and biscotti cookie presence the mouthfeel was fuller in body with good carbonation overall it is a solid beer
4021,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.35,pours a dark brown with a small tan cap and light lacing  smells of coffee booze and toasted malt  tastes of sweet toasted malt bitter coffee and a bit of caramel and vanilla the finish is slightly bitter and very boozy warm  this is a powerful well made not overly complicated not too cloy sipper my first pour from the can was too cold in retrospect this brew gets better as it warms    medium heavy body with light carbonation lush and syrupy mouthfeel
4022,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.58,really good imperial stout pronounced coffee smell and taste but not overpowering in regard to either really nice and balanced vanilla and almond flavor

4025,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.81,you can smell and taste the biscotti so good not overly winey like old coffee that some imperials have very smooth velvety mouth feel i dont pour for head so i cant speak to that you could wash down a donut or cinnamon roll with this my favorite stout right now
4026,Maman,4.43,pours jet black with a still no foam look heavy oily legs cling to the glass after the lightest of swirls it looks like motor oil thats been run hard through a motor for ten thousand miles  thick dark and viscous aroma pushes dark fruits plum and chocolate across the nose first char barrel bourbon and hearty roasty and toasty malts sit behind dark fruits is the dominate note at least immediately out of the fridge mild brownie shows up as the beer warms flavor profile is dark fruits caramel toffee tobacco raisins fig plum and chocolate the blend of notes conjours up thoughts of barleywines but retains heavy stout notes via late roasty and toasty malts bourbon barrel and char are all present to varying degrees molding into the 146 abv well brownie and more chocolate start to show up as the beer warms masking some of hte initial dark fruit notes it really develops a wonderful depth to the flavor profile after a fairly simplistic aroma mouth feel is thick and viscious but with an otherwise flat and still effervescence overall a blend of hearty stout and barleywine notes it has a lot of dark fruits for a heavy stout but despite that retains a good balance despite being in wine alcohol territory massive slug so 025 from overall  served in a 155oz speigelau tulip from a 750ml bottle 2020 vintage consumedreviewed 02122023 as a super bowl warmup for chiefs vs eagles

4029,Permanent Funeral,4.37,date may 20 2023 occasion i did not plan to write a review tonightbut then talk of bandbeerdistillery collabs blew up and i felt compelled glassware maudite snifter a dense opaque sedimentladen orangeamber body stares down the drinker with a thick offwhite head settling to a frothy substantial halo classic look a hyperboozy dankly resinous tree trunk falls on the nostrils with peach grapefruit dry grapes alcohol vapors and some backyard vegetable garden allure a bit gritty wowits softness alarms almost as when expecting blunt force and receiving a tickle or a hug the teeth are tingling for sure and the throat has a grondlike furnace warming but in between its smooth sailing and clear intentionsa beefy exhale is excusable when the inhale is this efficient at 105 a big bouquet of grapefruit pineapple lemon bourbon mint thyme and the dank resin promised by the aroma butterscotch and wet thatch balance its hopheavy impact this is another victory for the 3 floyds folks a sipper that breathes life into its drinker while killing him softly nicely done
4030,Permanent Funeral,4.44,16oz can poured into a tulip  a pours a clear deep orange color with a onefinger foamy white head that has great retention and leaves some lacing behind  s classic west coast style ipa aromas resinous pine zesty grapefruit  orange and a hint of fresh cut grass undertones of bready malt and a hint of honey  t bold zesty grapefruit up front with some notes of tangerine to compliment resinous pine and some grassy hop notes follow midpalate brings out some bready almost doughy malt the finish gives more bold zesty and resinous hop notes that stick around on the linger  m medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a creamy slightly warming finish  o a classic of the style that still holds up today good stuff
4031,Permanent Funeral,3.79,poured from a 16 oz can has a foggy orange color with a 12 inch head smell is of pine fruits taste is pine oranges dankness a touch of alcohol significant bitterness feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer but didnt quite blow me away
4032,Permanent Funeral,5,love the band love the brewery i have not had a bad beer from 3 floyds and this one does not disappoint how could it with a collaboration with pig destroyer at 105 you cant go wrong tons of flavor but goes down smooth i buy every 4 pack i find when it becomes available i wish this was a year round beer
4033,Bi√®re Du D√©mon,3.94,typical high strength belgian beer wont be to everyones taste but remember how its supposed to be drunk  sipped in the same way as a spirit two of these with a meal will last you the evening
4034,Bi√®re Du D√©mon,2.25,de club del gourmet de el corte ingles de el duque lata en copa alhambra viendo la casa de papel 3x0305 suave dulzor alcoholico sin estar mal el exceso de alcohol y tama√±o dificilultan terminarla si al menos tuviese mas riqueza de sabores
4035,Bi√®re Du D√©mon,1.48,330ml bottle as a gift from france shocking stuff  awful tasting throughout the nose definitely wasnt as bad  came through very slightly better than expected but still wasnt exactly great but the taste was beyond bad coming through as a mix of strong alcohol grain  the odd pale malt the beer was chemicallike in taste with an overpoweringly sickening taste  it meant it was one i struggled to drink even a fraction of before pouring it down the drain only its appearance  to some extent the nose saved it from being one of the worst beers ive ever had
4036,Bi√®re Du D√©mon,3.68,woooah there boy this tipple is likely to tipple you over the edge  mega strength beer and excessively so i actually think its not too bad better than some belgian tripels a tall slim glass keeps the head and served chilled takes a bit of the harshness away from it it has a citrus aspect for me and given the strength is remarkably smooth to drink dont be put off definitely worth a purchase if available a couple of these and youd be safe sleeping under a bush in the park on a cold nightthus saving yourself a taxi fare to boot which can be added to the coffers for sampling a few more brews every cloud and all that  i came back to rereview this one after a second sampling and down graded it a touch it is still way way better than the reviews on here and i think labelling it as a euro strong lager somehow assumes it will be naff right from the get go but there is the antisnob in me
4037,Bi√®re Du D√©mon,2.15,pours a clear maize color 15 inch head of a white color slight retention and slight lacing smells of strong alcohol slight dark citrus and grain fits the style of an euro strong lager mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level tastes of strong alcohol slight dark citrus and grain overall weak appearance alcohol completely dominates poor body aroma and blend
4038,Bi√®re Du D√©mon,2.68,colour light gold clear white head durability fatal immediately disappears aroma little crisp malty with a hint of honey and plenty of alcohol taste no surprises first alcohol the second 12 alcohol continue as in the aroma alcohol plus gentle malt and honey gentian alcohol low high saturation
4039,Bi√®re Du D√©mon,2.62,i read a couple reviews here and the bi√®re du d√©mon is rated as poor maybe thats a tad harsh just in my opinion for a french strong lager and as far as i know there arent many of those its slightly above average yes 12abv is a lot and especially for a lager its a beer i gave a try or two already and wont buy the sixpack assuming its exist a cheap buzz if you are around these parts for the same brewery though i suggest goudale instead
4040,Bi√®re Du D√©mon,3.28,aroma is very malty and hints at high abv color is clear golden with thin but sticky head taste is sourish and  hints of honey and plenty of alcohol burn mouthfeel is right and despite alcohol burn overall texture and palate is very smooth but beware the high abv for a small bottle this is potent stuff
4041,Bi√®re Du D√©mon,2.87,advertised as the strongest beer in the world this might be the booziest euro strong lager but with 12 abv its far to be the strongest beer i ever consumed very boozy nonetheless and cloying
4042,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,4.39,first day of oktoberfest  112 oz bottle acclimated to 41f and poured into a dimpled stein  pours a clear vibrant and darker rust color very nice color produces a 15 finger frothy barely cream colored head lasting a while and leaving a ring and spots of lacing beautiful beer  initial aroma is caramel and butter solids that have been separated from the oil its also slightly reminiscent of dough i seem to get some hops in the floral peppery range as well after agitating i notice a mild feta like smell really does smell salty  initial taste before swallowing is mildly bitter and sweet having trouble noticing anything else after swallowing its yeasty with ample caramel malt and pleasant bitterness i notice some hops in the back of the mouth tasting floral like white and green i also get that butter solids smell in the taste which i highly enjoy and a note of bready dryness in there i get a big hit of caramel tasting honestly like real caramel not just caramel malts theres sweetness to it too i get butter notes too so its approaching butterscotch genuinely excellent heavy note of damp grass with a little hay in the aftertaste as well as almost a cheesiness definitely umami whatever it is  mouthfeel is not incredible but still very nice i would say its very easy to drink and it feels great while drinking it not the smoothest ive had but absolutely full feeling the carbonation can be reconstituted through agitation although i dont find it adds a huge amount  overall im very impressed its been a while since ive tried a m√§rzen and i need to try more now this excels in every category id say my favorite overall part of the experience was the butter solids in the taste and smell and the big hit of caramel which tasted like real caramel and really wowed me this could be a rare example of beer id drink while eating although id stick to uncomplicated foods i could easily drink several happily especially in the late september weather as intended i love it  i will definitely buy again 6 packs ill happily recommend it as well
4043,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,4,12oz undated bottle  pours clear copper with an in of white head moderate retention and lacing toasted bread crusts in the nose with proofing dough medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel a bit tacky sweet plump malt on the palate with a balancing bitterness finishes malty and fairly sturdy without excessive sweetness
4044,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,4,good marzen happy to find on tap up front i was getting tons of malts and bitter hops about half way through i was picking up a lot of banana esters and alcohol sweetness a bit of caramel on the finish kind of played with my mind ill have to revisit this again to sort out my thoughts
4045,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,4.6,this is the oktoberfest you want if you like malty beers my guess is that this is the maltiest oktoberfest you will find anywhere at any price today and its certainly the maltiest i have had in many many years it pours a vibrant copper color and sports a good head that lasts  side rant this is precisely the oktoberfest i wish more small breweries would brew it is unapologetically roasty and malty and i dont know if it is too expensive andor too hard to brew for less experienced brewers but if you own or work at a small brewery tasteanalyze this years hackerpschorrs oktoberfest and then try to make it theres a difference you can taste in this beer this tastes like oldschool oktoberfest let the price of malt in 2023 be damned i honestly dont think theres any margin on this brew so im just going to conclude that this is hackerpschorrs gift to us this fall so just enjoy it prost
4046,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,4.89,appearance brilliantly clear medium amber frothy off white head with excellent retention  aroma bready and toasty malt spicyherbal hops  flavor toasted and bready malt spicyherbal hops restrained bitterness  mouth feel soft medium bodied moderate carbonation clean dry finish  overall perfect visual has the best head retention of all german marzens distinct complex malt profile with toasty and spicy flavor aroma also slight unique menthol note that is not unpleasant but displays mostly herbal and spicy aroma and flavor always an excellent choice if you are not sure what to choose compared to ayinger one of the best it drinks a little heaviersweeter but still quite dry
4047,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,3.97,pours crystal clear light copper colored with decent head limited lacing  solid aromas of caramel malt and earthy hopping a touch of grass  the brew has hallmark malt sweetness up front but there is plenty of earthy and grassy hopping to balance it  great carbonation without getting fizzy smooth and almost drying  pretty darn good
4048,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,3.54,bottle into fancy mug a substantial head no lacing penny colored s the smells are good but honestly its kind of weak like not putting out enough molecules hard to get much nuance other than mildly roasty malt t roasted malt right up front with a biscuity taste like when you slightly over cook biscuits in a good way a pleasant floral sweetness follows unsurprisingly given the thin aroma the taste passes quickly long but weak finish m thin o i recently had a bells octoberfest which bills itself as a session type beer this is a toastier version of same
4049,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,4.24,a good oktoberfest smooth pours a dark copper with fast dissipating head smells like dark fruit and bready malt and the taste is fruity bready malty but a little bitter and dry but not overly sweet or cloying this is a keeper for sure maybe my favorite marzen to date cheers
4050,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,4.26,poured from bottle the body is the familiar amber light brown fuzzy white head dissipates quickly and retreats to a thin edge ring light lacing  nose is an inviting malt taste follows nose and adds a balancing small bitter note a light malty sweetness is present but very much background  mouthfeel is smooth and satisfying with solid carbonation and slight coating of the palate  though it is not a coating of sweetness  superdrinkable as an oktoberfest m√§rzen ought to be best example of the style for my tastes
4051,Bar Fly,4.57,yesterdays meandering around through the bottle  backlog took a detour into the canquest tm however gloriously briefly but today it is back toon the bottlewagon 8 my recycler must be astounded this past month since i rarely fill the bin but i have been doing so on a weekly basis since  16 march usually i am laserfocused on cans  those get set aside for a  quarterly visit from jeff lebo over in york county for his massive canlection all is not lost however as most bottles contain things that i did  still want to drink especially the barrelaged beers and even more especially the nonwhiskey barrelaged beers they give me an opportunity to delve into my liquor cabinet where it normally remains closed with its contents merely gathering dust sigh my advancing age has softened me up so that i no longer desire shots i will merely pour a wee dram  sip on it over the course of the review for a pointcounterpoint this is one such beer  from the bottle somber and smoky barfly saunters into the room slowly thick smoke cool swagger good wood too much brass sticky leather slow glances lingering looks the only thing that didnt make the glass was maraschino cherry bring your own and wear out your welcome alaskas most wanted midnight sun crafts some of the most soughtafter beer in the world this line includes creative successes from several themed beer series as well as amazing oneoffs we hope you love our very special brews as much as we do a gracious thankyou to our longtime every weather alaska fans for yearround love  feedback bar fly smoked imperial stout ale brewed with smoked malt molasses and brown sugar aged in bourbon barrels 45 ibus  i was very anxious to pop the cap  start a slow gentle cline pour since i have been on a smoke beer kick lately i watched in rapt fascination as it foamed up to form twoplus fingers of dense foamy rocky deepbrown head with excellent retention color was stygian blackopaque srm  44 allowing zero light penetration nose reminded me of smittays smoked bourbon maple syrup 8o sweet smoky boozy woody all at the same time 8o mouthfeel was big full  creamy like a dollop had been scooped into my mouth  onto my tongue the taste was a masterful blending of smoke what i would have mistaken for maple syrup  a woody bourbon flavor 8o its smokiness was not as intense as say its alaskan smoked porter counterpart but this was not intended to be that i hope still it was far smokier than simply being an ais i was not pairing it with bourbon a because i did not have any on hand i prefer rye  b it was a subtle bourbon flavor where the smokiness was quickly becoming the superstar especially as it warmed phew the brown sugar gave it a maple quality helped along by the treacle this was quite the drink i found myself falling into drinking it like liquor a wee sip at a time  i could have poured this into a schooner glass at this rate ive to see it in this day  age but a schooner  10 fl oz was an option when i was a wee lad especially for those on the go have a quick schooner  be on yer way  the more i sipped on  of this the more my thoughts returned to ak id been to ketchikan  anchorage while in the navy but it was my 2008 trip to ancak that really bore fruit i had a lovely couchsurfing hostess who worked at la bodega  we did an early premorning raid during my visit they had la dragonne on closeout   i bought a bottle to exbeeriment with it actually calls for warming in a doubleboiler  when she returned home we her housemate  two other surfers  meself ha a steaming cup ready the house smelled magnificent  upon trying it she called her boss  had all remaining bottles set aside for us 8 the other lasting memory is of my partaking of salmon when she picked me up at the airport i was gnawing grilled salmon on a stick the following morning i made salmon scrambled eggs she called me at humpys as i was in the middle of plankgrilled salmon for lunch by the time that she picked me up i had candied salmon on a stick for us she was flabbergasted i ate salmon for three straight days  could have eaten more except that i had to get back conus drinking this put me in mind of both the smoked salmon  the candied salmon yum  finish remained fashionably smoky slightly bourbony with a sweetish treaclemaple syrupbrown sugar quality for all of that though it was still quite dry the smokiness left me feeling as though i had inhaled a nearby house fire not in a bad way but the smokiness was prevalent  unabating leading to an inherent dryness ymmv
4052,Bar Fly,4.29,the smoky aroma is stronger than it follows on the tongue but this is a damn good stout in its own right probably second to berserker and still a ways behind some of the others at the top of the stout game but midnight sun truly does its thing a little different and you will undoubtedly find some originality here not the same sad attempts to copy the greats i think you will be pleased especially for the price
4053,Bar Fly,4.16,midnight black body topped with a dense creamy light brown head nice roasted grain and cocoa aroma rich flavors of mild chocolate fudge subtle booziness vanilla bean heavy body rich dense and creamy velvety almost sludgy alcohol heat to counterpoint the chewy sweetness coats the palate  i dont pickup up any smokiness per se but the heavy chocolatey sweetness and bourbonbarrel aging meld together nicely
4054,Bar Fly,3.5,bottle at 2018 ris share dark black pour small beige head aroma is roasty chocolate ash taste amps up the ashy smoky notes gritty dirty earthy woody
4055,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,1.9,pours a pinkish orange no head formation not much in the way of aroma surprisingly with only a slight whiff of peach jolly rancher taste is rather more booze forward than other ritas  the peach just wasnt reaching me but the underlying sweetness was there finishes rather harsh as well with a moderate amount of rubbing alcohol
4056,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,3,bud light lime peacharita brewed by anheuserbusch with an abv of 800 this american malt liquor pours out a pinkish reddish color with a thin head this brew pours out of a 25oz can into a pint beer glass there is a small pink head to this brew but it goes away fast the smell is sweet with peaches mixed with alcohol you pick up on little to none on other beer notes in this brew now for the taste it is really really sweet lots of peach notes mixed with mirror grains and malts it is really hard to pick up on the 800 abv in this brew it goes down nice an smooth if you are looking for a fruity flavored brew  you should look this one up the body of bud light lime peacharita is a solid medium there is nothing overpowering about this brew if you like sweet peach flavored drinks this brew would go nice on a warm day or at a party the mouth feel is bold sweet tart smooth and refreshing overall i am going to give bud light lime peacharita a solid 3 out of 5 one of more drinkable aritas on the market i would look this brew up again giving the opportunity to just to change it up from other run if the mill brews on the market anheuserbusch did a nice job with this sweet brew
4057,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,2.58,a the beer is hazy peachy pink in color it poured with a thin collar of white bubbles around the edge of the glass that rapidly dissipated completely fading away s moderate aromas of fruit punch are present in the nose along with hints of peach t the taste follows the smell and resembles a hybrid of fruit punch mixed with artificial peach flavors with a heavy dose of added sugary sweetness the peach m it feels mediumbodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation o this beer hides its alcohol very well but is very sweet and seems to have lots of artificial flavors and colorings  serving type can
4058,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,1.5,bought a single 25 ounce can to try for 299 last week while at hyvee across the river in council bluffs iowa poured a light pinkishorange in color with no head to speak of aroma wasnt really all that good the taste is wellumm horrible poured it right down the drain along with the rest in the can no bueno
4059,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,2.24,poured from the can into a budweiser pilsner glass  quick soda pop fizz is made making a faint non retention head that dissolves in seconds without a collar fairly quiet on carbonation noise when settled and presents a wild body appearance the color is a perfect example on the can a peach orange color and a pretty good one its almost neon like in its appearance  aroma is straight up del monte from a can fruit cocktail and syrup with quite a bit of sweetness that seems to be the angle but its not really that enjoyable however a touch of rock salinity makes it a little interesting but the aroma is a just bit too sweet  palate is pretty much like just any other maltternative beverage sweet sickly alcohol and sticky peach syrup mid flavor palate lots of simple sugar like syrup and not much else even the salt character isnt coming out as much that was anticipated while luckily not too booze tasting it does hit in the gut afterwards there is too much hubba bubba bubblegum sweetness and flavor which doesnt even make the beer taste like fruit let alone peaches  it is interesting to compare this to its lime brother that one seemed to have an angle but this is just straight up booze sugar water
4060,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,1.74,welcome to my secand as a part of happy new is this beer sunday week 650 i had purchased this big boy a while back but when i initially went to review it an approved pic did not exist that is a nono for the canquest tm so i took the pic resized it submitted it  summarily put the can in the queue awaiting the appropriate moment like today  from the can malt beverage with natural flavors and artificial color  this came in one of those mighty 25fl oz tallboy cans which are unique in that they seem to fight me on the crack upon accanplishing this feat of strength that it took to open the dang thing the resulting noise was like a sonic boom an inverted glug was out of the question since a crane was required to lever the cylinder upwards  tilt it into a pouring position this action produced a brief fizzy finger of offwhite head that quickly reduced itself to wisps color was a cloudy peachyorangish shade srm  na the lack of clarity was surprising imho nose had an odd mustiness to accanpony the peachy sweetness hmm mouthfeel was thin  watery  not even all that well carbonated the taste was really sweet very artificial kind of medicinal  while evocative of peaches in some small way i am not sure that i would have hit upon it without a hint of some stripe phew plus it had a fusel alcohol burn that was not helping its cause in any way i was not really digging what this one had to offer it felt like liquid headache for later the unabating sugary sweetness was just not my bag previous reviewers mentioned gummi bears while another cantradicted this by saying that it did not even taste like peach candy i cannot remember what peach candy tastes like but i hope that it does not  this phew did minhas relocate to stl mo is a cyberinvasion imminent finish was hot  dry initially but once the sugary wave took hold it had a lasting sweetness that was unabating oh man this is beer oof
4061,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,3.64,25 fl oz can served in a becker glass  this beverage pours an orangish peach color and is cloudy if it had a head i missed it it disappeared quickly leaving no lacing  the smell is peach lime and salt  i have to admit it tastes like a peach margarita it has the peach and lime aspects at least ill admit that i am not a mixed drink person  thin mouthfeel and effervescent  it hits the spot on a muggy summer night and the convenience store is your only option
4062,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,2.38,a little bit better then the others ones not a big chemical taste but i could be a little bias because i likr anything peach flavored hahaha cheers
4063,Resin,4.38,this is crisp easy mouthfeel with smooth carbonation that feels right finishes clean and slightly dry straight forward hopcharacter the high abv is well masked and does not taste boozy very drinkable and i will drink again
4064,Resin,4,hazy gold color small white head nose is slight initially with flowery and citrus notes fullbodied finish is bitter
4065,Resin,3.71,12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for 250 pkg 22333 which means that this was packaged on 113022 that would make this beer 2 12 months old  look its a beautiful copper color with a slight hazeparticulate floaties in suspension appearance nice beigecolored head that is sticking around  smell mild citrus notes with tons of spicy hop resin and pine this is probably a bit too cold straight out of my beer fridge so the full bouquet is not coming out some herbaloniony notes on the finish subtle watermelon and papaya notes and some honey thrown in  taste this is aggressively hopped but you wouldnt really know it from the nose up front there is some caramel malt sweetness with subtle honey notes then the hops take over and this is an intensely bitter ride to the finish line and beyond the bitter finish lingers long and is full of hop resins and earthy woody pine along with lots of grapefruit peel and pith all this being said this imperial ipa maintains a semblance of balance because there is a significant malt backbone to support the aggressive hop bill as the hop bitterness on the finish eventually recedes some cool peppery watermelon notes are coming through giving this beer an oddly refreshing feeling  feel the body is medium plus with a slick oily mouthfeel  overall this is a really solid westcoast style double ipa personally imperial ipas are not my favorite of styles but i can dig ones in this vein occasionally for 91 abv its quite drinkable i would like to try to rereview this beer if i can get my hands on a fresher version
4066,Resin,4.75,as one gets older variety in the house gives way to what you like in the house living in ny has one perk in that you can get everything this is my house beer if you can get them fresh get them its a mans beer screw it if thats not kosher
4067,Resin,4.43,this is a big beer obviously at 91 it does come across a little boozy which does effect the texture or feel of the beer a bit that is to be expected with these bigger ipas though honestly one of my gotos for a bit big fun citrusy juicy resinous all of the adjectives
4068,Resin,3.91,pours orange gold with off white persistent head and excellent lacing  aromas of resin floral notes and soapy earth  the flavors are mostly resin and earth with only a touch of bready malt and grapefruit some booze and diesel on the backend of the palate  extremely lively and drying mouthfeel which helps make this one pretty drinkable  epic levels of hop bitterness a little simple and rough in that regard but i get what they were going for here solid
4069,Double Galaxy,4.5,always love when i get a chance to drink some hill farmstead and as usual it did not disappoint soft with great aroma and flavour from the hops that was easy drinking and went down way too fast
4070,Double Galaxy,4.15,can from jeff thanks for the hookup hazy bright lemon orange color with a thin white head that slowly dissipates tropical orange and bits of pine and grass sweet bready backbone pretty nice beer
4071,Double Galaxy,4.3,16oz can dated 9822  pours clear gold with a chill haze and a halfinch head retention and lacing is moderate grape and peach in the nose aromatics are unexpectedly subdued medium bodied with a crisp almost tacky mouthfeel white grape dank resin and faint garlic on the palate finishes with a firm bitterness light malt and lingering dank grape must
4072,Double Galaxy,4.65,on tap at armsby abby  l  golden orange with the usual hf fluffy sticky white head s  what a lovely showcase of galaxy not too sweatyoniony just tons of tropical fruit creamy citrus flesh and sweet floral doesnt pop out of the glass like trilliums galaxyforward offerings t  while the pineapple and orange sherbert notes of galaxy are definitely there theres also a decent amount of this interesting nelsonlike white grape character and also a hint of mosaiclile cattiness oat forward malt bill makes for a neutral sweetness f  i love the hill farmstead mineralic mouthfeel both tannic and soft fluffy o  favorite of the single hopped hill farmstead dipas  93100
4073,Double Galaxy,4.37,canned on   a  dark golden orange color with moderately dense bright white lacing thats very creamy looking  s  dank passion fruit peach and citru with dank spicy citrus rind on the nose  t  dank citrus and peach take center stage on this one followed with pineapple spicy citrus rind and some peppery notes  m  big medium body with a soft smooth texture  o  as expected this is a pretty fantastic dipa not a 100 imo but its up there
4074,Double Galaxy,4.62,this is very close to a perfect ipa in my mind great representation of galaxy hops nice white head sticks around smells like candied pineapple and bubble gum taste has the pineapple on the front but a nice bitter backbone body isnt too thick which makes it remarkably drinkable
4075,Double Galaxy,4.06,can into glass canned 8 days prior to review medium thick frothy white head that quickly thins out vivid cloudy medium orange color with much intricate lacing to start off with the aroma has a candied malt guava pineapple a little mixed sweet spice underneath flavors of candied tangerine peel guava passion fruit with a bit of help from some medium toast malt in the background to fill out the body and some of the flavors there is a bright effervescence to it as well the finish is largely a mixed citrus peel glow then a moderate bite
4076,San Miguel Especial,3.05,spanish brewed versionlikely better than the uk one  rather large bubbles looks refreshing aroma of dry malt and some faint hops i like the bitterness in the aroma  the malt is far more flavorsome than the majority of pilsners as is common in spain mahou is far superior but i much prefer this to estrella which for me is mega overrated when i was younger i stayed in a holiday resort in ibiza where all alcohol was free and this was the only beer on tap there were water jugs at our tables so i emptied the water out and walked to where the san miguel tap was i saw another person with a water jug full of san miguel and smiled at him and said english he smiled back and said yes    so for about 2 weeks i substituted water for this its dry reasonably complex and as long as you drink the spanish verion and not a dodgy sub licence one which exist in multiple countries its pretty good the hops add a dryness with not much flavour however because the malt is flavoursome almost as flavoursome as belgian malt the beer tastes pretty good unlike some other dry pilsners such as croatian pan and romanian ursus which literally have no taste beyond the dryness  i didnt used to like this but because of my current location i have had so many terrible beers recently i quite like this mouth feel is impressive for a pilsner pretty good overall i like uk version is terrible though as are some of the other internationally brewed ones from memory some dont even say where they are brewed  
4077,San Miguel Especial,2.92,look  golden clear nice white head smell  grainy taste  grainy clean feel  light body with a crisp carbonation overall  not bad but still lacking depth
4078,San Miguel Especial,2.74,canned in a full pint can and a gift frm a neighbour for helping out pours a fairly clear lemon jello coloured body with decent white head aroma is semolina  candy cigarettes without the sweetness so is the flavour
4079,San Miguel Especial,2.88,sanmiguel especial which come in a standard 330ml bottle with a medium abv of 54 not to be mistaken with another beer named like that from the philippines  poured into the guinness it left a two inches white head quickly vanishing as i write this clear and golden yellow brew  on the nose its pretty dull some hints of floral notes and thats about it  on the palate its again not opening a pandoras box of aromas of flavors but that was expected for something i was fearing would be another mediocre industrial euro lager its a bit richer than that i like the dry finish and drinkability but i wasnt looking for more from this one  its a medium bodied beer with high carbonation dry finish and drinks well  overall its not as awful as reviewed here or elsewhere best drink fresh and cold would probably pair really well with espa√±a food but in lack of a chorizo or paella right now not to mention being quite far from the puerta del sol this will be a one and done ticked reviewed not a huge aficionado but there are far worse european lager around here
4080,San Miguel Especial,2.54,440ml can 50 version brewed in the uk by carlsberg  drank from the can and a glass tastes like copper nails tastes far worse as it warms up very metallic tasting  drank from a bottle previous times and really enjoyed it
4081,San Miguel Especial,2.94,this one 54 abv is far better than their 45 version lager which most people have rated under the philippines branch brewery even though many of us obviously have had it in spain anyway the 54 version is quite malty with a barely sufficient hoppiness an acceptable premium lager not great but well worth having with or without a meal in spain this rating is based on a bottle bought in norway had travelled well
4082,San Miguel Especial,2.5,440ml can 50 version brewed in the uk by carlsberg l clear golden colour with many streams of bubbles excellent head is big white soapy  longlasting served in a cold glass with beads of condensation this is exactly how you want a lager to look s absolutely nothing t sweet  grainy negligible hop flavour f thin mouthfeel almost saved by moderate carbonation o incredibly bland designed to be drunk ice cold looks great and is well sessionable otherwise poor  ps do drink ice cold this beer becomes sickly sweet as it warms
4083,San Miguel Especial,3.25,had on tap in barcelona
4084,San Miguel Especial,3.15,l pours a clear golden with a bigfoamywhite head medium to high carbonation visible s honeyspicygrainycornfloral t follows the nose f medium carbonation light body o more malty than most premium lagersthe malt base reminds me a lot of staropramen but with the typical low bitterniss of other premium lagers a drinkableif unexciting premium lager with a heavier malt base than its competitors
4085,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.34,nothing nuanced about this beer including the bottle art that no doubt will appeal to those young at heart the color is not bad sort of an orangish golden color no real head or lacing the smell is the weakest thing here not sure what it is the taste is simply boozy and not a particularly pleasant booziness maybe a hint of anise anyway not a repeater
4086,Hell On High Quad Bock,1.44,poured from a bottle orangish in color with almost no head smells of dark fruit yeast and alcohol sting of alcohol old fruit and leather in the flavor nothing much to be happy about here take a pass here
4087,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.2,169 oz bottle  states on label  beligian style and quad bock  whatever that is supposed to mean  pours hazed to murky orange with a thin wispy head minimal lacing  the smell is of overripe fruitiness tough to pick out any individual fruits  just a fruity character in general boozedsoaked caramel comes through loud and clearmaybe a subtle hint of cotton candy maybe thats the belgian part  the taste is something like sweet fruit punch with caramel raw alcohol is present in a malt liquor way harsh  this is a rough one doesnt really fit a style  maybe a doppelbock  but close to a malt liquoreuro strong lager hybrid its cheap and high in abv
4088,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.04,500ml bottle poured out a clear golden orange color with a small white head of foam it smelled of booziness caramel and toffee so sweet and boozy so hot
4089,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.12,pours with virtually no head has an orangish amber color not the best smelling beer has a malty smell with an odor that is best decribed as over ripened fruit most people would not find this appealing  but when it comes to taste this seems to be ok for what it is stronger beers like these are hard to find that are smooth or good tasting now this beer unfortunately is not an exception the taste is something along the line of over ripened apple and there is definitely some alcohol burn with this one not for everyone also very little carbonation but definitely a bit better than most beers of this category this is the type of beer you drink when you want to find your date more attractive defintately a kicker but worth a try if you like stronger beers was found at not a bad price 200 for a pint at tone country liquor on 47th and richmond chicago
4090,Hell On High Quad Bock,1.26,a gift from john and lorene no date on the bottle but it has a nice label l pours a clear reddish orange without any discernible head s alcoholand for lack of a better phrase a rotting taffy apple t the 14 abv hits you right upside the head and finishes with an unpleasant rotting fruit taste o without a doubt one of the worst beers ive ever head its so bad that if i had a trip to lithuania a planned id cancel it
4091,Hell On High Quad Bock,3.6,rinku≈°kiai hell on high quad bock 169 fl oz brown glass bottle coded l10443 299  roger wilco pennsauken nj  notes via stream of consciousness against my own better judgement having already had one of the strong beers from rinku≈°kiai im going to go ahead and try hell on high at least the label is good with a devilish looking character petting a white poodle so even with a rough pour i was unable to bring up a head theres a little bubbly foam here and there but not much that really hurts it in terms of appearance the body is a very hazy deep amber with an orange sheen and golden highlights the aroma is malty and caramelish with a light bit of applelike fruitiness the flavor follows and im quite surprised its much better than i thought it would be the rich caramel maltiness is pleasant and not overdone and there are no offflavors the alcohol does show slightly but i think its actually helping to dry it in the finish along with its median bitterness some herbal hops and refreshing applelike fruitiness it could be a more carbonated but its not bad it works well with the full bodied maltiness im going to guess its around 20 volumes of co2 where a standard beer is around 25 and a cask ale is more like 18 i keep smelling it swirling it waiting to find something bad come out as it warms but it hasnt happened yet however more and more alcohol is showing but well see if all of that malt keeps it in balance    hmm its stayed pretty much the same except that it has lost some carbonation which leaves it even softer and that hurts it on mouthfeel despite its chewy maltiness the bottle label did say it was bottle conditioned but i highly doubt that and even if it was its hard to coax enough carbonation out at 14 abv so what to say its perfect for malt heads and those who just love strong beers for anyone else its more like a golden caramel flavored dessert beer and even in that its pretty onesided im surprised its as clean as it is and so nothot with alcohol but thats not enough to pull it beyond a decent beer despite its quad bock status
4092,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.52,we gotta call it for what it is this is kind of an overabv joke label from lithuania a flat dark whiskey body no head nothing on top fail s absolutely fine with sweet fruit predominant alcohol laden fruit cake cider bb t the taste follows nose but more complex and nuanced with sweetness whiskey soaked fruit fruit cake tempered by smokey malt and grain backbone again whiskey like a bit harsh after a few sips perhaps a good cooking liquid f sharp cloying not crisp on the thicker side w very low amount of carbonation o subpar overall too sweet too harsh
4093,Hell On High Quad Bock,1.78,appearance cloudy orange color with a few surface bubbles as a head  smell over ripe golden apples and alcohol are most notable and unappealing  taste grainy malt base with honey over ripe apples pears and lots of warming alcohol  mouthfeel heavy in body smooth from start to finish long lasting sweet and burning aftertaste  overall this beer is way too sweet with a rancid apple flavor with loads of alcohol burn not for me
4094,Hell On High Quad Bock,3.17,this unique brew was enjoyed from the bottle in a snifter pouring a very nice clear and bright amber this beast produces a thin ring and subtle pool with very light lacing nose of heavy apple cider light brown sugars and strong grain alcohol flavors follow the nose with brown sugars and golden raisins awash in apple cider and beaten to death by strong warming grain booze decent mouth feel warming and lightly coating let it warm and be lightly rewarded yet know that the strength of the grains and booze increase as well beating you over the head with strong booze  decent but a touch over the top without enough depth  cheers
4095,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.98,if there was a beer equivalent to getting punched in the head this would be it it tastes extremely grainy smells as dank as it tastes that being said i love this ish for a 14 beer it is still comparatively drinkable  give this to your buddy if you want to here him talk about his divorce for two hours
4096,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.94,from the bottle it pours amber with virtually no head somewhat malty aroma  lots of grain alcohol and some grainy malt in the mouth this beer hits you like a freight train
4097,Gallo Draft,2.12,pretty bad
4098,Gallo Draft,3.07,a54 a55
4099,Gallo Draft,1.21,this is literally the second worst beer i have ever had if youre ever in guatemala take your own beer looks like piss smells like sour skunk and not the good kind tastes worse feels like a decentish macro so its go that going for it  you should try it if you go to guatemala but only for that nostalgic moment of so when i was in guatemala i had this horrible beer called gallo
4100,Smooth,4.3,yellow gold in color with a murky complexion the aroma is of fresh nectarines and lactobacillius im tasting fresh nectarine juice and lactobacillius which on a day with a 100 heat index is very refreshing the mouth is crisp and moderately carbonated
4101,Smooth,4.5,finally got to visit side project and this bad boy happened to be on and did not disappoint great acid level that was not overpowering and was just dripping with ripe nectarine flavour phenomonal beer
4102,Smooth,4.24,burnt orange with white head that quickly disappears tart nectarine and barnyard funk crisp and dry overall quite nice
4103,Smooth,4.42,pours an amber orange with white head aroma of oranges and grapes hits you with a sour pucker that fades lots of orange nectarine with vinous notes very well done
4104,Smooth,4.19,look  clear golden with great rimming smell  tart yeasty grain taste  fantastic nectarine tartness feel  light and crisp slight syrup overall  really nice beer
4105,Breakfast Stout,4.94,amazing taste for a dark stout beer
4106,Breakfast Stout,5,well well well well well stout lovers of the world unite and take over
4107,Breakfast Stout,4.2,had on tap at bulldog saloon lynnwood wa
4108,Breakfast Stout,3.61,im rating this based off of the kentucky breakfast stout drop beeradvocate says its retired but i just grabbed a pack of them last week it is sarcastically chocolate perfect amount of coffee in my personal opinion but the chocolate is objectively overwhelming i love this whenever im really in the mood for something rich but any other time its a bit much great specialty beer
4109,Breakfast Stout,3.84,almost pure black with a small tan head the bubbles dissipate pretty fast leaving just a few smaller ones and some lacing  very strong coffee smell there is a hint of chocolate helping to balance things a bit  not surprisingly there is a strong coffee note up front then the chocolate sweetness kicks in there is a lingering bitterness at the finish  it is a bit thinner than expected mostly carbonation on the tongue  i can see how this is the base for the kbs beers it is pretty solid with so much coffee flavor id consider this a dessert beer its good but i definitely prefer the kbs variants
4110,Breakfast Stout,4,pours a great thick black with a nice head that does hang around throughout the drink smells of coffee with a slight sweetness black coffee with one sugar has a medium mouth feel tastes of bitter coffee maybe over roasted coffee but does give off a good feeling of a nice early morning cup of joe
4111,Breakfast Stout,4.49,12 ounce bottle poured after warming for 30 minutes into a founders snifter dark mud coffee black fine dense brown head that recedes slowly aroma of italian roast ground coffee beans and cafe cubano a chocolate note too wickedly tasty leads right off with the coffee then char and dark chocolate run around like a marble in the mouth finishes mildly sweet then slightly bitter and dry oats delivers a fine creamy smoothness medium carbonation overall a beautiful expression of brewing creativity and truly an anytime treat
4112,Breakfast Stout,2.73,i love coffee i love stouts i love oatmeal stouts i usually love coffee stouts given all that i expected to love the 2 oatmeal stout in the world according to the current ranking unfortunately i didnt the coffee smell is above average but the taste is overly bitter and mostly just reminds me of bad coffee that was roasted far too long this one is not for me
4113,Breakfast Stout,4.75,poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass  appearance very dark brown nearly black with a dark tan head so thick that it required multiple gradual pourings to prevent overflowing the glass moderate lacing  nose dark roast stone fruit brown sugar coffee  theres a lot going on here  mouthfeel creamy moderately thick  attack dark roast coffee chocolate smooth  plenty going on here too  finish alcohol and bitterness from the dark roast that balances everything wonderfully  overall its hard to imagine how an american oatmeal stout could be any better than this  so full smooth and wellbalanced theres nothing id rather drink with biscuits and gravy but its also going very well this morning with goetta and scrambled eggs this beer deserves every bit of its high ratings
4114,Breakfast Stout,4.39,poured into a nonic glass at about fridge temp but letting warm up  pours dark black with a tall almost gusher tan head 4  aroma is big and strong roasty coffee and a touch of sweetness 425  again strong and just bitter enough black coffee some dark and roasty malts and lingering slightly bitter finish 45  smooth body and very easily drinkable for the higher abv no sign of booze or burn but a bit warming in the chest as i keep sipping 425

4121,Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],3.84,we have a live one careful when opening very active this is going to sound gross but trust me it is not the taste is prunes and raisins combined with cola and yeast like i said trust me the taste is very enjoyable though admittedly not the most deep in fact the depth is a little short in the nose too and especially in the body want more because what they have is good
4122,Oatmeal Stout,2.91,kind of weak in smell and taste mild molasses flavour
4123,Oatmeal Stout,4.65,if only the owner wasnt such a terrible person

4126,Oatmeal Stout,4.28,poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass  appearance nearly black with a very large tan head that required a gradual pour to keep it from overflowing the glass the head dissipated gradually leaving moderate lacing  nose a sweet pleasant mixture of caramel and dried fruit with slight alcohol  mouthfeel moderately heavy smooth slight carbonation  attack sweetness followed by dark roast  finish slight bitterness from the roast  overall highly drinkable true to the mild character of an english ale ie not near as intense as its american oatmeal stout cousins
4127,Oatmeal Stout,3.5,this is at least 5 and maybe as old as 10 years old so ill adjust ratings as best i can pours cola brown with reddish tinges minimal head possibly a byproduct of the age aroma is pretty shot smells oxidized taste is actually a little better than i anticipated still some nice full roast notes feel has become thinner with age

4130,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3.44,great for a lager witch what it realy is
4131,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2,worst beer available in winnipeg next to kokanee
4132,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3.18,im not sure ive given this good a score to a beer that everyone else per the ba average felt was so poor but i must say this beer did its job refreshing after 90 minute flight delays in chicago and a bumpy bus ride from calgary airport into the rockies  more important than my review is my remark that i find it funny the brewer calls this an ipa i presume in the british tradition since nova scotia is close geographically and spiritually and ba has 697 reviews with american blonde styling it also should be noted that untappd averages this as a 3 rating and bas average is 263 something screwy going on here since i find ba usually 25 above untappds average not to quibble but remember beer is to be enjoyed first and analyzed second  and since alexander keith is the pride of nova scotia they deserve better than average overall hugs from me i went on their website and they are genuine for 200 years
4133,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3,12 oz bottle pours golden with white head aroma is of sweet fruit and bready malt body is medium and crisp floral hops bready malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth medium dry finish ok brew
4134,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2.34,people dont understand that this is not the english ipa first brewed by alexander keith in halifax back in 1820 the first ipa brewed in north america until anheuserbusch got their claws into it this was a heavilyhopped all malt no corn mash ipa now it is a weakflavoured lightlyhopped 5 abv blonde lager which meets none of the criteria for an ipa this is not the beer i drank at university not even a pale forgive the pun imitation it is thin light with no lacing and a taste typical of anheuserbusch swill might as well be drinking bud light but no one really drinks that its just an urban legend just like the notion that there are people who actually drink moxie this was my goto beer back many decades ago but now i wouldnt touch it
4135,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,1,so i rated this as an ipa much like if someone showed you a cow and asked you to rate it as a horse so as an ipa this is terrible as a lager it is good
4136,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,4.7,all the complaints about wanting this beer to be an ipa or i was tricked needs to understand this isnt a real ipa hell this was one of the first mainstream ipas out there its brewed like an ipa and was supposed to make the journey to india and ferment but instead it just gots sold in nova scotia and became the standard beer not reaching that fermentation it doesnt hit the same as a real ipa buts boy does it do the trick and many a nights where you just come home reeking of this fine working mans beer stops comparing it to sierra nevada ipa its in the class with the beers that put hair on your chests like miller lite and coors lite
4137,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3.99,good autumnwinter beer can see myself drinking these on a crisp day at the golf course
4138,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3.29,i bought a can at the lcbo in ontario 473ml at 5 my can was very fresh the letter e which stands for may 2021 brewed  poured a 2finger head into glass that was leaving a lace as you drink it i expected more sweetness when i see india pale ale on the can but its not that sweet at all  overall its an easy drinking beer more like a lagered ale then a ipa beer to me  cheers
4139,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2.29,beer tastes like lager and apple  if you were to drink this at a bar it would taste like a bad beer  i am whelmed with this beer and the facilities that it gives me
4140,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,1.14,this is not a beer but this is whisky with beer i didnt enjoy it i think you drink beer to drink it and get after i while a good feeling not to bee stong drunk after just 1 beer so i do not recommend this
4141,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,2.89,too robust for my stout arse
4142,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,2.49,visited amsterdam made a grocery store run and picked up a dozen random bottles this was one and i didnt even check the abv until halfway through shortly after thinking good lord this is sweet  it is sweet cloyingly sweet and sharp and malty but otherwise bland and only slightly beery interesting i guess but no ones version of a great beer
4143,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,3,30cl bottle clear amber with a very thin white head very sweet with notes of malt sugar boiled grains bitter hops and alcohol
4144,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,2.39,light orange with a quickly disappearing layer of foam which makes it look like a root beer within a few seconds the smell is not that bad fresh herby and yeasty the taste however is an unholy matrimony of sugar and booze with some malt no attempt has been made to hide this guys huge abv though it can be pretty refreshing despite its abv please skip this one taste should always be priority number one
4145,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,1.24,served in a flute at 6c appearance  standard lager colouration heavy co2 and rocky head that dies off instantly and leaves little lace  smell  oddly chemical with grainy corn possibly  taste  medical alcohol and a very off putting chemical element  mouthfeel  watery and metallic  overall  the drinkability of this one is almost nil drain pour unless you are a homeless park drinker i dont mean that to be as harsh as it sounds i do feel for people in that situation but still this is a beer i associate with homeless alcoholics not a good look or a good beer my advice is avoid this one
4146,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,3.24,not bad for a strong lager very hard to find
4147,Double Crooked Tree IPA,4.04,undated can into pint glass pours a slightly hazy amberhoney color with a brief light tan head no lacing initial impression is citrus pine and malt  very straightforward dipa mouthfeel is sticky like a 12 dipa ought gto be finish is sweet and malty overall a very enjoyable dipa
4148,Double Crooked Tree IPA,3.92,look  really nice thick dark auburn color with a big slight tan head and lacing smell  lots of caramel malts and piney hops taste  bitter piney slight citrus hops with a thick caramel malt backbone feel  thick body with a medium carbonation
4149,Double Crooked Tree IPA,4.39,appearance  this dirty pond brown had an appropriately moderate head  smell  the nose is powerful and equal parts toasted malt and heavy citrus hops with light lemon this is a big balanced dipa  taste  the monster hops step up at the taste but the heavy malts keep them in check a sharp pine flavor shows up at the taste  mouthfeel  this fullbodied dipa is moderately dry i expected a superdry finish but the caramel from the malts keeps it pretty even there is absolutely no alcohol sting so beware of this 120 abv heavy hitter  drinkability  this is dangerously easy to chug
4150,Double Crooked Tree IPA,4,12 oz bottle from 2015 dont know bottle date  poured dark amber minor head dissipated quickly with some lacing  nose of a convoluted battle between hop malt pine caramel and  teriyaki   palate of hops and hops interlocked in a battle with malts caramels and pine semi thick mouth feel with slight sting left on the tongue higher avb not really noticeable on the mouth but definitely warms the central nervous system after several quaffs  this one aged rather well becoming smoother just the teriyaki aroma on the nose i cant place my finger on and seemed a little off  enjoyable
4151,Double Crooked Tree IPA,3.91,holy crap this beer is kicking my ass and taking names twelve ounce can from siciliano in grand rapids poured into a 16 oz willi glass deep amber color topped with 2 inches of firm white head that lasts longer than one of those my pillows you see advertised on tv smell is a mix of pine biscuits and pure sweet alcohol did i mention this is 12abv i cant remember because it kicked my ass and took my name on the tongue this hits you with a well balanced but extremely potent mix of malt and hop bitterness 86 ibus with tons or resinous pine a hint of grapefruit and dankety dankness to the max although i can smell the alcohol the brew does a good job of hidi g it in the flavor profile this is a great old fashioned true double ipa in the west coast style i love it but cant have another tonight because it kicked my ass and took my name

4158,Don De Dieu,3.91,aroma gives off spice and malt body opens with a bouquet of spice honey banana and more bready malt carried on a mouthfeel of satisfying carbonation crafting a very fun time very nice
4159,Don De Dieu,4.15,strong flavors of orange lemon coriander banana and clovelike spice it pours a murky yellow with a lot of white head and has a nose of banana apple and wheat notes of orange vanilla and bread the mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a sweet and tangy finish overall a fantastic beer that is easy to drink and has a great balance of flavors
4160,Don De Dieu,4.25,delicious tripel i get mostly white grape and peach flavors with a nice creaminess there is also a little breadiness as well i actually prefer this to la fin du monde
4161,Don De Dieu,4.51,12oz bottle best by 101424 into a spiegelau wheat beer glass l pours apricot dark gold fairly clear at base w a thin smooth  flat bright white head lots of fine carbo head recedes to a rich creamy skin no lacing s yeasty bready light honey banana caramelized malts grains citrus zest graham cracker light alcohol w warming t yeast sweet caramel malts floral honey banana a sensation of coriander doughy sweet yellow bread light alcohol w warming f gently sprite  brisk clean then soft mediumbodied feel w a plump center and a medlength lightly drying finish o a very easy drinking beer with great flavors and an overall lighter taste this beer is brilliant expertly brewed and is outstanding personally one of my higher rated beers
4162,Don De Dieu,5,i tried from the bottle amazing beer flavor of wheat sugar honey good carbonation overall awesome feel its definitely 5 out of 5
4163,Don De Dieu,3.54,missing something from the real belgian tripel perhaps its missing the evolution from sharp coriander to a smooth sweet finish instead this iteration of the umbroque line has a rather dull evolution while still hitting the right notes  a bit disappointing considering since this was marketed as a belgian wheat beer as such i thought it would be a quebecoise take on hoegaarden but instead it was just a worse version of tripel karmeliet with some wheat notes
4164,Molson XXX,2.84,kinda mid weird aftertaste not a fan of the corn flavor personally
4165,Molson XXX,3.4,l moderate yellow the head lingers and leaves some lacing but not super foamy s mildly sweet smell and barley malt t more malt than anything sweet but not enough to offend no harsh alcohol or medicinal flavors impressive considering the style and abv it definitely tastes like a malt liquor but in a good way not noticing the corn flavor probably still has corn syrup in there f medium carbonation medium body does not linger o considering the style price and abv its pretty good its inching pretty close to steel reserves niche and doesnt taste gross at all would recommend trying it for those who like the style
4166,Molson XXX,3.78,12 fl oz bottle served in a can glass  this beer pours a brilliant amber hue and is topped with an inch of beige head that leaves spotty lacing  sweet malty aroma with some grain and grass scents  sweet taste upfront actually the sweetness carries throughout the taste not much in the way of hops hints of alcohol  medium bodies with an almost syrupy mouthfeel  i am just happy to get a 12 pack of super premium beer with all these 2025 four packs out there fantastic value for the money this used to be my goto beer at my local moose lodge it was 2 a bottle there
4167,Molson XXX,3.11,its a malt liquor from canada its crystal clear pale yellow and has very little head the flavor is semi sugary sweet with an unpleasant harsh alcohol presence there is no hop character or bitterness its better than a malt liquor from the us that is all drink accordingly
4168,Molson XXX,2.43,12 ounce bottle poured into a tumbler pint glass  l brilliantly clear yellow one finger white head is constantly renewed by masses of rising bubbles s subdued quick whiff of grainy malt light aroma of clean spicy hops t super malty medium sweet bread grain corn a medicine taste developed about half glass sweetness builds f medium body crisp to open smooth finish o nice feel but the sweet medicinal flavor im getting isnt for me
4169,Molson XXX,3.52,picked up a 6 pack from the case in the cooler simply because the liquor store i live above doesnt have as many choices as the others in town wasnt expecting much but that was the beauty of experiencing this the other reason i decided to grab it was the fact it was brewed in golden so i was confident the water would make the beer tolerable since its so high on the abv scale pours and retains a large 4 finger head staying with the beer all the way down and leaving sticky lacing on the weihenstephan glass dry finish sweet initial taste almost a mix between a belgian golden ale and an american adjunct great malt liquor would revisit and recommend
4170,Molson XXX,2.85,this was not awful alcohols was well hidden despite cheap ingredients mostly inoffensive nose of malt and corn flavors similar with some bready notes similar to molson golden i would have another of these for sure in a pinch
4171,Molson XXX,2.79,got a 12 oz bottle of this for free recently poured into one of my pint glasses this pours a very clear medium golden color with lots of streams of little bubbles continuously and rapidly rising to the surface has a nice white head thats an inch thick when first poured that settles to a very thick surface coating and a very thick ring lining the inside of the glass and decent lacing head settles eventually to a nice film layer of surface foam and there is some pretty good lacing in the inside of the glass too after a few sips aromas of some bready malt sweetness along w whats likely corn and rice and not much else not the best aroma by any means but not unpleasant or offensive either the taste is pretty much the same some bready malt sweetness followed by rice and corn and just a slight hint of hop bitterness as i get a few more sips into this and as this starts to warm up a bit im starting to taste an unpleasant grassy cardboard metallic bitter like off flavor of some sort also a touch of hops has a crisp and also smooth medium bodied mouthfeel w moderate carbonation that unpleasant grassy metallic bitterness taste lingers on my palate after each sip im not even going to finish this one  eric
4172,Molson XXX,2.82,24 oz can pours golden with a light white head and lots of small bubbles a light malt with ad little hops on the nose mouthfeel is light with just a little bubble foam on the palate the flavors are decent with a bit of malt and a generic hops you dont get the 73 bite you might expect has a sweet rather than dry finish a decent north american adjunct beer try it if you like simple adjuncts
4173,Molson XXX,1.88,from a can poured into a frozen mug some malty bread corn smell clear gold with 3 finger head theres a slight sweetness to it and mostly malt not great but not horrible is it worth it because of the 73 abv no if thats your destination youre better off getting a good bottle of scotch or bourbon
4174,Molson XXX,5,i read some of the reviews which are ridiculous paragraphes about notes of and hints of  are you kidding me if your trying this beer and youre a beer snob then dont rate it i tried this brew on my lunch hour at work with a sandwich and some veggies and it was great better than a bud lite and satisfying for a quick lunch brew during work break im not a beer snob but usually drink good beer founders shorts sierra nevada but for a cheap satisfying brew on launch break this beer is great notes and hints escape me this is why wine snobs get bilked out of millions because they think they know wine tasting drink beer to enjoy not to examine btw my great grandfather was a brew master from the old country who drank and made good beer and passed it down to his family ive said enough enjoy this brew
4175,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,1,my friends and i were camping and we were on a budget we saw a 30 pack cans of this for 899 it was rape via beverage the beer looked cheap it smelled awful and it tasted worse it felt like a dead orphan this was by far the worst beer any of us had ever experienced it was so bad we decided rather than drinking it we would use it as target practice the ammo cost more than the beer it was the best use of ammo in human history forget gettysburg i never thought i would shoot unopened beer cans but it was a joyful catharsis our souls were cleansed of that evil brew
4176,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,3.6,i feel that this is an underrated beer yes is is one of those beers that one purchases when the budget is tight however that is what i like about it when i want something that is highly drinkable and cheap it is on my radar

4178,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.04,it is what it is a cheap ice beer with a sweetsour aftertaste
4179,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.83,great bear compared to others in its similar category obviously youre drinking this to save money and get a nice buzz easy to get down compared to other ice type beers natty  keystone regular milwaukee
4180,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,1.87,12 oz undated can poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp the beer is very pale golden straw colored with essentially no head or lacing the aroma is a bit chemical but faint taste is predominantly bitter with no malt presence mouthfeel is sharply carbonated with a slight oilysoapy character typical of these beers overall not good but ive had worse this can was 63 as a single so drink it ice cold from the can if you choose
4181,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,5,best bang for the buck beer bever
4182,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,1.57,milwaukee special reserve ice has an initially medium offwhite head which fizzes away much more like a soft drink than a beer a clear somewhat bubbly straw appearance and no lacing left behind the aroma is of wet straw and the flavor is of cheap storebrand grape drink wet straw green apple with even a touch of hop bitterness at the back end mouthfeel is light and milwaukee special reserve ice finishes semidry and unappealing but i was able to choke it down  rjt
4183,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,3.02,poured from a 12 oz can has a pale yellow color with a 12 inch head smell is of corn a bit of malts taste is mild malts some plastics kind of mild flavorless yet unoffensive feels light in the mouth and overall considering the low price point is about what you can expect from this style
4184,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.19,save your money folks this isnt worth the time trouble or hassle for you to drink go with a 40 ounce of mickeys ice or something because this beer is funky tasting i seen it in the store and figured id give it a try especially for 250 a 6 pack well the only good note is i had lacing in the glass the head was thick but quickly went away the smell is grainy and something old
4185,Bir Bintang Pilsner,2.92,bintang pilsner 330ml green glass bottle best before bb190122  notes labeled for export only clear deep goldbrass in color beneath a short head of bright white surprisingly good head retention and lacing aroma of basic dull grainy malt and generic hops fyi this is an adjunct beer with sucrose added flavor follows with no exception short and dry finish mediumlight in body and crisp overall quite dull and boring
4186,Bir Bintang Pilsner,3.36,that bitterness make me sick but at least this beer is still drinkable
4187,Bir Bintang Pilsner,1.51,330ml bottle in a hotel in surabaya at inr65000 the cheapest on the menu i had to check the label as i initially thought the waiter had brought me a nonalcoholic version very little to recommend here other than the fact it can be gulped down like water taste not dissimilar to water in fact boasting the colour of weak tea and a rapidly diminishing foamy head this drink entices the nose with very little at all the tasting doesnt disappoint as the hope of any flavour is dashed by its soapy blandness if youve been surfing all day this stuff is probably great but i hadnt and it wasnt
4188,Bir Bintang Pilsner,1.28,looks and feels like most standard malty american lagers bland malt smell head thins into a broken lace looks like apple juice or urine tastes malty with a metallictinge and a slightly chemical soapy aftertaste in the part of indonesia where i stayed it was the most abundant and affordable alcoholic beverage and was a decent thirst quencher avoid otherwise
4189,Bir Bintang Pilsner,1.64,decanted from a 112 oz 330 ml can into a custom taster pint best by 30 july 2019 a pours a nearly clear dark golden color with a less than one finger briefly foamy white head no serious retention and little or no lacing s picked up a butyric acid aroma throughout hard to smell anything other than that t dry almost an apple flavor very light malty and grainy with low bitterness m light bodied with very low carbonation drinks smoothly but slightly astringent o off aroma of butyric acid is pretty much a deal breaker this was also not an old can based on the best by dating so no excuse basically a very low end pilsener might be my lowest rating ever
4190,San Mig Light,2.74,bottle pour into a tulip glass clear golden appearance with a foamy white head that recedes quickly to a collar and lasting surface film and no lacing musty laundry nose grain scallion metal taste light body and carbonation
4191,San Mig Light,2.68,poured into a 30oz thermobeaker  readily brings up a whitish head that soon dissipates  dry and light  drink when ice cold  ice a twist of lemon to give it some flavour very refreshing  certainly an acquired taste but perfect for tropical countries  benefits from low carbs for the figureconscious  not for connoisseurs
4192,San Mig Light,2.55,this one pours a very light yellow color with a small head and a little bit of lacing  this smells like essentially nothing  the only redeeming quality of this beer is that when it is very cold it is refreshing theres essentially no flavor to it  just crisp coldness theres a little bit of grain sweetness and it finishes surprisingly dry  this is very light bodied watery fairly crisp and decently drinkable  i would only drink this beer at icecold temperatures thats the only way it would be enjoyable
4193,San Mig Light,1.5,330 ml can brewed under licence by pt delta indonesia abv is 49 clear pale yellow colour low white head sweetish industrial aroma notes of artificial candy thin and fizzy mouthfeel nearly void of flavour quite dry only a touch of sweetness in the background one to forget
4194,San Mig Light,2.74,a bit harsh for a light beer but the bite is not to harsh to enjoy it works well on a hot day but not when trying to analyze the flavors aftertaste is a bit metallic
4195,San Mig Light,1.16,reminds me of soda water without as much flavor lacks character or taste this is a meet market brew aimed at those looking for a hook up at the local watering hole kind of a white zinfandel of beers
4196,JJJuiceee Machine,4.48,a  pours a deep orange with a two finger creamy white head nice amount of soapy lacing  s  aroma is mango orange cantaloupe grapefruit and catty hops  t  the taste is mango orange cantaloupe honeydew lime and a piney bitter finish  m  medium body with medium carbonation creamy mouthfeel with a soft crisp finish  o  another tree house banger
4197,JJJuiceee Machine,4.62,mine says 82 abv es machts nichts  pours a super hazed goldhomey color with one finger of eggshell colored head sheets of lacing  good head retention  s oranges peaches guava  t follows the nose papaya green melon dryness  cantaloupe up front just a touch of grapefruit papaya green melon tangerine as this beer warms up a little bit of cherry limeaid as well finishes dry with some tang orange notes pineapple more cherry limeaid  kiwi fruit  mf medium body fairly soft carbonation great juicinessbalance some acidic notes  this totally brings the flavor  the juice so thrilled to have the chance to try it
4198,JJJuiceee Machine,4.71,look  thick hazy milky tannsih orangish yellow with a thick white head lacing and thick rimming other than it being darker than expected fantastic smell  big tropical juice mango heavy followed by citrus orange and dank taste  sweet tropical dank juices mango orange and resin feel  medium full body with a medium light carb slight creamy overall  really fantastic
4199,JJJuiceee Machine,4.6,pouring that ubiquitous tree house turbid hazy color in this case orange the creamy off white head coats the glass as you drink the beer  how do they do that every single time anyway the nose is a citrus juice lovers delight with slabs of mango ripe oranges and passion fruit assaulting your olfactory senses incredible  the taste is simply the nose on peds with the mango leading the citrus deployment for the ripe orange and passion fruit flavor yet allowing a nice sweet oat flavor to cover the flank  the mouthfeel is full soft and supple it should be a felony to make an 8 abv beer this drinkable but its not surprising coming from the hazy masters
4200,Art,4.86,batch 6 probably my number one want and what a treat to check if off up at the source wonderfully complex from aroma through the finish  bit of a wild funk character bit of white wine fruitiness bit of drying oak bit of honey sweetness bit of herbal hops and a bit of english muffin just fantastic all around this may be the best regularly available beer in the world  98100

4204,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Peruvian Morning,4.46,thank you basaywhat  pours into glass black and starlys that way with a fizzy mocha head that goes away as quickly as it build not much barrel on the nose but it comes in nicely on the palate along with some delicious coffee and cocoa flavors chocolate and crystal type malts dance in there with no noticeable hops worth seeking out
4205,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Peruvian Morning,4.04,poured from a 12oz brown bottle  label notched 2018  bourbon barrel peruvian morning brewers reserve poured an almost blackvery dark brown with a thin tan head the head dissipated rather quickly to a small and narrow collar of foam the smell is dominated by coffee and bourbon from the oak barrels the taste is of coffee and chocolate up front with hints of caramel and bourbon at the finish mouth feel is highmedium to full with moderate carbonation there is a little warming from the bourbon at the finish  peruvian morning is a complex flavorful american imperial stout that is very drinkable for its high abv
4206,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Peruvian Morning,4.19,very chilled bottle poured into my gi snifter as it warms over 45 minutes the coffee and barrel presence become more pronounced with the barrel having the upper hand i expected a bit more from this one still a very good beer
4207,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Peruvian Morning,4.52,l very dark brown color almost no head not much lacing to speak of light carbonation  s chocolate coffee  t chocolate coffee sweet alcohol very nice  f full bodied full flavored  o a superb imperial stout more on the dessert side
4208,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Peruvian Morning,4.21,a  dark brownblack mostly opaque with reddish highlights in the semi transparent edges head is light tan minimal with an immediate fade and no lacing  s  a nicely restrained barrel and vanilla booziness over a chocolate and coffee core  t  follows the nose with a strong vanilla open a bright ice coffee middle with dark chocolate highlights and a finish with subtle acidity delivers all the notes youd hope for with grace and almost delicate precision  m  acidic but with mild carbonation and very light for the abv and flavor profile a warm close and you come away with a mild lingering presence a trailing note that is quite pleasant  o  a friend gave me a bottle and im quite glad to have tried this one delicious
4209,Orviamo,4.49,10 year blend poured from a 750ml bottle into a rocks glass pours ruby red to light amber with a finger of offwhite head that recedes into a collar around the rim of the glass big oak dark cherries plums and raspberries on the nose taste follows and its pretty sour tasty though the barrels dont play as much of a role due to the fruit additions thick full mouthfeel lively carbonation and acidity really good think it could use a little more time
4210,Orviamo,4.22,beautiful dark reddish beer that smells of berries and tastes of raspberry jam probably the jammiest beer ive ever had delicious but wished for more of the sp funk to come through on this one still absolutely delicious glad to have tried it
4211,Orviamo,4.53,750ml bottle served in a side project stemmed glass  pours a dark reddishbrown body one finger white head good retention not much lacing or film smells of jammy raspberry and a touch of stonefruit a bit of funk a bit of dark fruit and a bit of oak this is the stuff of dreams big fruit presence with a complex barrel presence thats what an awa is supposed to be right flavour is very similar tons of jammy raspberry some stone fruited plum bright vibrant fruit sweetness intermingles in with dark fruit and the parent spirits a bit of warming heat on the end not unlike whiskey served neat mild fruity funk but overall the fruit is the star of the show mouthfeel is medium bodied soft and perfectly carbonated and you get very little hint of the 10 abv aside from the warming feeling as it goes down superb very complex overall another wonderful heavy fruit jammed acetic wild from two of the best brewers in the us doing this type of wild ale its quite balanced nowhere near as sour as everyone has made it out to be even more fruit than expected and thats saying a lot
4212,Orviamo,4.07,750ml bottle poured into a side project oversized wine glass generously shared by erik enjoyed on 11616 reviewed from tasting journal  the beer pours a deep maroon color hues of burgundy and crimson hazy and cloudy with a bone colored head about a finger high that has good retention and lace the aroma is very intense and very complex all of the barrels are immediately present very fruity loads of raspberry prunes and very cherry forward strong port wine tannic acidic vinous very rich very deep with soft oak a bit of vinegar and some potent booze character the flavors offer a bit more in terms of balance and lets each element breathe still the various barrels are front and center loads of port wine vinous red wine and rich and oaky bourbon with a fantastic helping of raspberry and plum more plum than the nose suggested delicate and tart with some light vinegar and some warming alcohol the mouthfeel is nice coating lively almost juicy at times with a medium body and a crisp finish  verdict a very intense wild ale from side project and de garde perhaps too much at once rich complex with great depth but at times the balance is lacking and the 10 abv is very apparent
4213,Molson Dry,5,excellent
4214,Molson Dry,2,not much taste not much of anything if i was handed this blindfolded i wouldnt think it was beer does not taste bad but does not taste like beer
4215,Molson Dry,3.24,i bought a can at the lcbo in ontario 473ml at 55 poured a 2finger head into glass  taste was refreshing and smooth with a crisp finish overall an average lager beer cheers
4216,Molson Dry,2.64,tastes like piss
4217,Molson Dry,3.07,750ml can purchased from ontario grocer poured into a large glass mug the entire 750ml fit in the mug lively and foamy head that lingered for a few minutes and dissipated to a 18 film throughout the drink a surprising amount of lacing carbonation was heavy off the start but tapered off and was rather subdued by middrink smells of corn with a very slight skunk  that familiar molson aroma that is ever present in every college dive bar ive frequented in ontario the taste was surprising very little of the adjunct skunk that i know and expect from molson product instead i was pleasantly surprised with a nuanced flavor with light grain notes temperate hop bitterness on the back of the tongue and a dry finish  no offputting aftertaste either i purchased this can with the intention of slamming it in a review i was expecting a boozy version of canadian that didnt happen i honestly enjoyed it its simple refreshing and was attractive from pour to finish i wouldnt turn this down in the future at 55 and 750ml this could certainly do some damage if several were downed on a hot summer day
4218,Molson Dry,3.21,it pours a nice light yellow color with a nice head i started drinking this when we would travel to expos games in montreal we would bring back a 12 pack each time we came home it was a good tasting beer not the best molson but good tasting the beer has a hoppy and dry finish which shouldnt be a surprise since its in the name
4219,Molson Dry,2.27,pours a clear yellow with decent head that is the highlight of this one the scent is faintly grassy with a hint of lemon the combination does not hit my nose well taste follows the smell with some obvious bitterness evident thin mouthfeel and a slightly unpleasant bitter aftertaste
4220,Molson Dry,2.76,473 ml can served cold into a pint glass lcbo purchase for 250 cdn or so continuing my recent minirun on molson products  appearance  fairly bright golden color nearly two fingers of white head poured as well that fizzle out in a minute or two no lacing great clarity  smell  no smell other than some creamed corn and the slightest hint of apple skin  taste  virtally nothing watery maybe some faint trace sweetness  mouthfeel  it is indeed dry carbonation is a bit too much but is okay with the lack of flavor  overall  for a beer that tastes like nothing yet has 55 abv and is dry as indicated on the label molson hit the target the set here unfortunately its not a brew worth repeating still couldve been so much worse
4221,Molson Dry,3.21,473ml can that was purchased across the boarder in dunham  crystal clear pale yellow golden hued brew slight sweet smell of corn and a mild cracker graininess clean for the most part bone dry with a kiss of alcohol very clean grain flavor modest hop bitterness  not a whole lot of flavor but a bit drinkable or perhaps just refreshing
4222,Molson Dry,2.46,l straw yellow fairly clear lowmedium lace foam dies down quick  s smells like any cheap lager still better than most american beers  t tastes clean bready corn i really dont get much hopps but they must be in there best served ice cold from a cooler of ice to down quickly for a warm buzz  f goes down clean tasting like great western light lager in the yellow tint can without that watered down taste of american lagers though  overall a 710ml can for 450 cad hits the spot if you want to have just over one with the boys its best drank ice cold like most cheep brews
4223,Molson Dry,1,a terrible dry beer ive never had a good dry beer
4224,Abricot Du Fermier,4.68,l pours a very strong pale orange yellow with no head and no lacing on the glass  s a nice toasted oak leads off followed by a nice hint of brett some nice apricot and notes of sour tartness very nice aroma  t a strong brett and apricot mixes with lots of sour and tart and a nice strong toasted oak amazing golden sour  f smooth medium body and good carbonation  o this is a world class golden sour ale
4225,Abricot Du Fermier,4.57,look  slightly hazy orange with a great thick white head and sticky lacing and rimming smell  tart candied apricot woody taste  for sp not as tart as some still tart but pretty great candied apricot and woody like the smell feel  medium body and carb slight creamy lasting tingle afterwards overall  really fantastic beer
4226,Abricot Du Fermier,4.4,appearance  the beer was the color of an apricot it was golden orange with some red hues carbonation was visible  smell  the apricot seemed dry in the nose but you could easily can detect a funk of a saison  taste  at the front the apricots were quite sour it really tingled the sides of the tongue there was an undercurrent of fruit sweetness toward the back the funk of the saison came through and provides a sense of balance  mouthfeel  the body was vicious almost like an actual fruit smoothie  overall  i can definitely appreciate a saison like this
4227,Abricot Du Fermier,4.55,pours an apricot orange with a little haze to the translucency transparency drops towards murky when the last of the bottle is poured into the glass head never forms aroma is apricot right off the cuff although its mild and nuanced into the profile stone lemongrass and earth add some more depth it has a pleasant tartness to it leaning into a little acidity flavor profile takes the acidity up a notch especially when served at fridge temperature the acidity wanes as the beer warms apricot adds some sweetness and is more forward than the nose taking up a more dominate role its still well balanced and nuanced into the flavor profile cellar stone earthy malts grass and lemon zest create the rest of the profile all accompanied by some minor tartness mouth feel is still in effervescence delivering a smooth texture thickness is medium overall a tart apricot saison that delivers tasty simplicity  served in a 155oz speigalau tulip from a 750ml bottle blend 5
4228,Oude Kriek,4.29,from a bottle season 1920 cloudy red color with no head sour cherry smell medium body and a slick feel tart cherry and some floral notes with a sour finish classic example of the style
4229,Oude Kriek,4.3,cloudy purple body nice initial head on first pour that quickly fades to nearly nothing except a faint circular wisp around the perimeter of the glass a nice musty fruity aroma a very faint touch of horse blanket a wonderfully balanced flavor of cherry sourness lowkey alcohol and a touch of earthy woodiness mild to moderate tartness counterbalanced with a moderate fruit sweetness a smidge of wheat in the background medium body nice mouth puckering tartness not too intense and nicely offsets the cherry sweetness  this is just an incredible beer the blending and barrelaging artfully melds together some great flavors and produces a sublime mouthfeel  pouring temperature 49 f bottling info bottling date 10 oct 18 best before 26 oct 28 blend n 83  season 1718 additional info macerated for 5 months lambics originate from 4 different barrels and 5 different brews
4230,Oude Kriek,4.87,smells like a classy parfume the aspect remembers the oinopa ponton the winedark see that homer sings in the odyssey the taste became more and more complex and satisfying while i was drinking it its a quite good balance of flavour alcool sour and fruit
4231,Oude Kriek,4.44,blend 32 season 1819 bottled 12319  its funny just last night i had allagashs coolship cerise an americanized kriek now its time to have an authentic belgian version of the style ive been picking up more of these 3 fonteinen bottles i see on the shelves because theyre pretty much always available for a decent price given what they are and they never disappoint lets get into this one  pours a slightly cloudy ruby red with a finger of pinkish white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  the cherries are definitely front and center in the nose but theres a malty vibe that makes it feel like a funky pie im picking up on aromas of sour cherry graham cracker lemon juice wet hay pie crust apple skin buttery oak and light tangerine  it has just as much of a cherry presence in taste but the tartness is even more focused on the front end of the sip im tasting tart black cherry sharp oak wheat bread vanilla juicy strawberry lemon juice and crabapple the swallow brings notes of tart black cherry pie crust lemon juice wheat bread cinnamon vanilla sharp oak wet hay and light apple skin  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a sharp yet smooth beer finishes mostly dry and very refreshing  oh yeah this one is great it goes down ridiculously easy but still has a wild complexity to it
4232,Oude Kriek,4.34,blend n 71 season 1718  appearance clear red color with no head but a few bubbles that quickly disappeared  smell moderate barnyard and some tart apple and cherries aromas  taste tart cherry notes feature upfront in the flavor profile followed by tart citrus notes and some faint grassyhay notes while the cherries are noticeable there is no sweetness observed unlike many fruited wild ales the beer finish is dry  mouthfeel fairly lightbodied with a low level of carbonation appropriate for the style  overall a good fruit lambic the flavor profile incorporates the cherries nicely and comes off very smooth
4233,Oude Kriek,4.43,bought at bottle craft in san diego ca 1899 for 127 oz bottle i remember when i first started drinking craft beer i remember thinking anything over 1 an oz is outrageous now that still seems pricy but not nearly as outrageous bottled 62618 consumed 070422 brought in part to celebrate purchasing my first place and for the holiday i let it warm to probably 50f before opening  as i can see from the inside of the bottle that there is going to be a ton of sediment at the bottom it will be interesting to see how this changes the different aspects of the beer once poured not very lively when opened sometimes you get an explosive pop when uncorking this was a mild plunk without the sediment the beer is translucent almost opaque crimson red over time this color shifts more towards marron the head is basically nonexistent although interesting only when poured is there head but the bubble is large and transparent very unusual looking a few lazy bubbles of carbonation make their way to the surface the aroma is surprisingly alcohol forward for being 66 abv  tm initially without much of the sediment the flavor is super tart primarily consisting of underripped strawberries and cherries upfront the flavor stays but the tartness decreases over time semidry the mouthfeel is light and more carbonated than i expected the taste doesnt linger too long and the beer is not heavy on the tonuge  overall pricewise this beer is i think worth it for special situations i really enjoyed it even with the price consisted it was a phenomenal example of the lambic  fruit style close to being on par with fou foune
4234,Oude Kriek,3.53,375ml bottle poured into tulip  pours a hazy cherry red with a ring of pink bubbles around the edges of the glass that leaves scattered blobs of foam as it recedes  smells of sour cherries fresh soil barnyard funk raspberry jam on bread and boozy oak staves  tastes of cherry vinegar cold cherry pie more breakfast table raspberry jam woody funk moist earth and oaken barrel staves  feels light and sharp medium bodied with fizzy carbonation finishes sour  verdict recommended this is a seriously sour beer its pretty tasty but make sure you brush well after drinking this fucker or all of your teeth will fall out
4235,IPA,4.16,poured from a 16 oz can dated 70523 into a shaker pint glass l  pours a clear medium amber color with a fluffy white head that dissipates slowly s  smells malty and citrusy t  tastes piney hoppy and bitter f  medium body and carbonation o  delicious west coast ipa not sure why i didnt try this one sooner
4236,IPA,3.39,appearance gold haze from particles ok head pretty good retention  smell mild pine and citrus aroma  taste i think the age might be starting to hit this a bit of sweetness then moderate citrus bitterness but feels like its coming part with a watery body instead of a blended taste tastes are kind of clashing  overall this was canned 82222 bought and reviewing in june 2023 usually i dont review old beers but the 12 pack was refrigerated at the store most of its life and frankly most alesmith is pretty old around here so it serves as a valid review in my opinion its not bad im sure its better when fresh
4237,IPA,4.04,purchased as a 4 pack from wegmans in collegeville pa can date 3223  l bright amber slightly hazy  s pine  citrus slight booze  t crisp bitter citrus good malt backbone  f very dry crisp and clean  o a fantastic wcipa
4238,IPA,4.52,wow
4239,IPA,4,overall extremely drinkable always happy to buy this classic but the new can art is not doing it any favors the pattern hop art on the side is more at home on the can of a much smaller newer brewery
4240,IPA,4.43,pours a golden color with a thick foamy head  smells of bread and yeast straight up  well not much to say here straight up simple and delicious
4241,IPA,3.94,alesmith brewing ipa  725  served from a 330 ml can apour is gold from the can to a dark gold in the glass with a medium size white head leaving a spotty lace along the tulip scolumbus  citra hops give off a hints of citrus  pine tamerican west coast ipa  malt dominates with a decent bitter swallow mfok carbonation  big full body ovvery drinkable prost lampertland

4243,IPA,4.28,appearance pours a golden amber color with a soapy white foam head  aroma after pouring i let it sit for a minute very piney sweet from the malts hints of pineapple and citrus  taste sweet malts up front followed immediately by piney hops and a low to moderate bitterness great balance bitter lingers in the finish for just a bit and then it goes clean  overall this is a quality beer that stays true to the roots of real india pale ale i feel like lots of care was put into brewing this and it shows in the product very happy with this one
4244,IPA,4.67,smooth and crisp one of the best ive had not too hoppy and packs a punch great flavor with no aftertaste i hope i can find this one in the stores
4245,IPA,4.28,where have you been my whole life pours copper in color slightly darker than normal nose is piney and pure hops taste follows suit with the pine resin bitterness as a west coast ipa should glad alesmith is distributing to my area
4246,Backwoods Bastard,4.74,this is one of my favorite beers on planet earth it has it all and i buy it any chance i get it really does sip similar to a single malt scotch which is great because i had to swear off my whisky fetish awhile back beer makes me behave much better i get the typical notes of vanilla caramel and toffee from the bourbon barrels and it has a bit more sweetness than similar beers which i personally love not too much but just right lastly the mouthfeel on this beer is top notch i cannot recommend a beer more than this one
4247,Backwoods Bastard,4,335 ml bottle bottled on 41023 samoled on 81723 looks dark like stout on initial pour red highlights bubbles when held under light smells boozy due to 11 abv taste is dark bitter chocolate scotchy notes apricots feel creamy and thick overall not bad a bit boozy defo a good beer a plus imho a sipper not a chugger id put this in the catagory of desert beer it is like a hershey candybar melted in a peaty single malt scotch
4248,Backwoods Bastard,4.67,on tap at the brewery 8 oz poured into a snifter  appearance very dark brown slight offwhite head that lingered long leaving even considerable lacing  nose alcohol dried fruit  mouthfeel medium thick adequate carbonation  attack very complex rich malt dark dried fruit followed by warming alcohol  finish just enough bitterness from the roasted malt to balance the attack  overall this ale well deserves its worldclass rating the only wee heavy ive enjoyed more was the old cincinnatibased quaff bros collaboration wee honey
4249,Backwoods Bastard,4.6,bottled 92216  poured at fridge temp into a tulip glass  head gushed out as i popped the top pours a light cola brown with light coming though on the ends and a 1f tan head that settled quickly but persisted down the glass 45  scotch heat and warmth off the nose sweet malt and caramel a delight for sure 45  malty scotch oak and barrel lingering earthy hops its a fantastic sipper and good cold or cellar temp 475  warming but solid moderate body with just the right amount of bitterness and carbo 45  overall the best wee heavy ive had to date and would love to try again 45
4250,Backwoods Bastard,3.84,caramely the high abv is perfect going down not too much but really adds
4251,Backwoods Bastard,4.45,im sorry i dont know how to review like everyone all i know is i was having a sophies choice beer battle with myself and i a diehard stout lover said overall probably backwoods i was delighted to see it was ranked so high
4252,Backwoods Bastard,4.45,bottled 3 months ago 121422 look ruby red decent head recedes quickly lots of smoke opening the bottle smells amazing like toffee raisin marshmallow candied nuts and definitely scotch whiskey taste really satisfying everything youd want from the nose whiskey a kind of mapley sweetness pecan smokiness vanilla just delicious had with some chorizo sausages a good meal 11 so be careful  had this another night and picked up a lot of cherry maybe some chocolate buttery and smooth mouthfeel pleasantly carbonated that scotch taste is what does it for me in this beer need to try more of this style
4253,HefeWeizen,3.36,pours a murky straw color im disappointed in the head particularly in its poor retention and hesitation to grow the aroma is far superior showing off clove banana and bubblegum in equal measure some nice wheat notes pop up after warming up a tad flavorwise it follows the nose albeit not as intensely the banana clove and bubblegum are all there albeit muted i also get some wheat flavor on the finish everything is properly balanced and where it should be its just that everything is at 60 intensity the mouthfeel is oddly sharp and honestly a bit watery the carbonation is there but the softness isntnot at all did the dmv get a lesser batch or something this is definitely not the 2 hefeweizen to me and it certainly doesnt measure up to the best german examples its fine though  id take it over quite a few americanmade hefeweizens
4254,HefeWeizen,3.56,on tap note had can from same distribution as keg and it didnt perform any better in fact slightly worse there are obvious differences in what others are perceiving so maybe we just got a subpar batch in the dc area  the beer allowed the bartender to fill liquid to the top of the glass even drinking it down a tad and swirling things around barely revived the razor thin ring of bubbles the body was a fairly cloudy pale bruised banana  the nose is of moderate strength but has a banana bubblegum quality that is nice a little bit of the banana comes through in the taste but theres also a lemonspritzed grain flavor that is more prominent as i started sipping  allowing the beer to warm a bit along with noshing a little food opened up some more familiar hefe notes the banana and bubblegum upped their game a bit to replace the tangy lemonlike note i was getting edging the beer towards the sweeter side of balanced  overall this still wasnt wowing me and i think the somewhat watery feel i was perceiving hurt it the most id be willing to give this highly rated beer another try at least to see if maybe i was just a bit off today
4255,HefeWeizen,4.65,when i first drank this  bought from an exxon station of all places  i didnt know anything about beer but i knew immediately this was something special and it became my choice when i wanted to upgrade from a 40oz malt liquor in the years since i have learned to name the component flavors and the processes that yield them in the brew which im sure you can research but that all seems beside the point  what is the point then simply this is a smooth tasty complex beer very little compares in the us and its better than paulaner you can enjoy it slowly you can smash it equally interesting to the scholar and the party animal a desert island beer that would also work in the frozen tundra the last beer you might ever need the omnibrew
4256,HefeWeizen,3.7,20230610 12oz can served in something similar to a wineglass with no stem can is dated 021423 got it from mrsandman101 in a trade  pours moderately hazy with a fairly small foamy shortlived head which settles to nothing at all theres a little bit of active carbonation that i can see smell is spoton yeasty banana notes a little spiciness that makes me think of cloves  taste is also spoton reinforcing what i got from the nose theres also a nice grainy characteristic  mouthfeel is leaning toward thin feels pretty still overalltastes good smells good needs some head retention  it looks indecently naked
4257,HefeWeizen,4.37,date on can 04192023  pours a cloudy golden orange in color with a finger thick foamy head that dissipates to a thin layer with time carbonation looks quite lively theres a fair amount of lacing as you drink although most of it slides down the glass pretty standard look for a hefeweizen although i think the head could be a bit creamier and longer lasting nitpicking though  lots of banana clove and bubblegum on the nose bread and butter with a hint of spice not unlike banana bread a classic hefeweizen aroma  taste follows the nose pretty much identically banana wheatbread clove bubblegum simple yet refined and very clean  this is medium bodied with delicately zesty carbonation and a tiny bit of chewiness i actually expected this to be overcarbonated happy to report that it is not however i also expected this to be chewier it feels a bit thin overall though that does lend to its drinkability  this is a finely crafted bavarian style hefeweizen if you gave it to me blind i would probably guess that it was from bavaria which is truly high praise i doubt i could find a better brew of this style in the us it wont be my highest rated for the style but its certainly up there i must admit that i am not a huge hefeweizen fan though i do crave them occasionally this one drinks extremely smooth and clean it is simple but whats there is high quality ive actually had this one several times but for some reason never got around to rating it i did not realize it had such a high rating here but it seems entirely justified live oak continues to impress i have not had anything from them that has been less than superior cheers
4258,HefeWeizen,4.84,on tap in a pint glass from a bar in austin texas look classic hefeweizen look mildly opaque straw yellow with 05 fingers of white head smell wheat and bananas taste follows the nose plenty of wheat bread and banana notes feel medium bodied with good carbonation overall there is no doubt why this beer is considered world class by beer advocate delicious and on par with the best hefeweizen beers from germany i was so impressed with the taste of this beer that i returned to the same bar the following night and ordered another
4259,HefeWeizen,4.23,32823 on tap at live oak brewing austin tx  hazy yellow plenty of lingering lacing  certainly reminiscent of weihenstephaner heffe perhaps slightly thinner and less complex but certainly high quality  enjoyed this one very much
4260,HefeWeizen,4.67,elite hefeweizen that hits all the notes banana bubble gum touch of cloves on the aroma and taste lighter bodied easy drinking maybe borders on a little thin if im nitpickingprobably the best us made hefeweizen ive had and better than some germans like paulaner
4261,HefeWeizen,4.53,12oz can from tx locals trade  pours a nice straw yellow with a bubbly head  traditional hef aroma heavy on clove and banana  wheaty banana and spice  lighter body with just enough carbo  probably one of the most solid hefs ive ever had
4262,Leaner,4.52,look  hazy orangish copper with a really nice white head and rimming and slight lacing smell easy peach tart taste really nice slightly tart peach and wood feel medium body and creamy overall  love it
4263,Oktoberfest,3.74,had this on draft look came in a 12 ounce mug copper color with an off white head arrived without a head and very little lace aroma bread malts a little caramel sweetness taste toasted malts and some sweetness easy drinking decent slightly above average octoberfest
4264,Oktoberfest,4,tasty stuff from a quality outfit l from the can  it is appropriately festive s quite a bit of aroma very nice get the malts the sweetness richness t follows the nose plenty of sweetness with a bit of a tangy bitter after taste good stuff f pretty rich for a lager o works for me from some of the reviews i guess your mileage may vary but tasty oktoberfest in this mans opinion
4265,Oktoberfest,3.62,clear copper with big dense offwhite head great retention thin rings of lace toasted bread aroma some caramel a bit of grape leads me to believe they went heavy on munich malt tastes like it smells slightly sweet medium bodied and appropriately carbonated a touch sticky not my favorite octoberfest
4266,Oktoberfest,3.25,drinking from a sixtel keg just tapped its interesting the color is a rich coppergold with nice straw colored head there almost zero aroma and a bland slightly sweet taste to match but nothing unpleasant its very drinkable
4267,Oktoberfest,4.23,a very clear dark amber appearance with a lasting white head body and carbonation both hover around medium aroma is maltgrainy dark breaddark breadtoasted grain breaddark honey taste has a very mild sweetness but stays true to the aroma overall an excellent oktoberfest
4268,Oktoberfest,4.16,copper brew with a frothy yellow head  it looks beautiful nose evinces rich bready malt its mediumbodied and lightly carbonated definitely quaffable there are both sweet and toasty malt flavors on the palate the finish boasts a very slight touch of hops its an interesting take on the style and ill be glad to have it again i would however mistake this for a conventional german oktoberfest
4269,Oktoberfest,4.51,found a 12pk of this recently for the bargain of 6 i absolutely love m√§rzens  festbiers and i know that they age quite well so lets give it shot  l pours a beautiful clear copper with a fluffy 2 finger tan head with great retention delicate lacing forms on the glass  s very forward in the maltiness department caramel toffee dark roasted bread and roasted nuts fill the nose first followed by an herbal and floral aroma from the hops smells like a real winner  f flavors follow the nose to a t the sweet maltiness is perfectly balanced with the subtle herbal floral noble hops that help cleanse the palate for the next sip overall quite rich  f mediumfull bodied creamy smooth and easily sessionable for being as rich as it is but is a little heavy for the style  o tr√∂egs are really on to something here this m√§rzen can easily stand toe to toe with anything brewed in germany its beautiful to look at rich and flavorful and surprisingly sessionable this is truly an excellent choice
4270,Oktoberfest,4,12oz bottle purchased from the fridge as a single for 199 freshest by 120322 so this was probably bottled four or five months before that date in either early july or august if so then this beer is three to four months old  look pours a perfectly clear medium copper color comes with onefinger of a tan colored head with decent retention slow to moderate visual carbonation  smell nice maltforward notes of caramel toffee dark bread and honey very nice toasty aroma the finish has a crisp effect with subtle floral and earthy notes from the hops subtle notes of fall spices graham crackers and dried fruit also  taste its very balanced and tasty for 61 abv its very easy to drink the flavors mirror the nose up front its malty malty malt ball city with earthy undertones the beer is malty through and through however the finish is somewhat drying and mildly bitter i also get lingering semisweet chocolate and raisin notes before i knew it my glass was almost empty very drinkable and tasty  feel i would say that this is medium bodied with a slightly chewy mouthfeel and finish its a clean beer that is slightly crisp but the maltiness still wants to hang on the palate for a while just to say im still here and i still love you  overall i have enjoyed many of troegs offerings but im pretty sure that this is the first time that i am having their oktoberfest i have heard many positive reviews about this beer this season so i decided to pick it up when i saw it available as a single bottle i enjoyed this quite a bit at the same time with this amount of age on this beer at three to four months old i dont think that i would want to have more than one or two of these per session i also wonder how much different this beer tastes when fresher if much at all this is a solid oktoberfest marzen example that is inline with the traditional style  from the bottle malt pilsner munich hops hallertau tradition
4271,Oktoberfest,3.85,pours a burnt amber color with a soapy offwhite head nose is somewhat earthy and sweet hints of roasty malt caramel and toasted brown sugar maybe flavor is on the money for me toasty malt foundation subtle hop flavor coming on without bulldozing everything enough body to let you know that you have a real beer in front of you yet still very drinkable this is quite good hope they bring it back next year
4272,Moment Of Clarity,4.58,pours a deep dark browntoblack color with a finger and a half of tan head the nose is ludicrously good  it smells like milk chocolate syrup poured over crushed bittersweet chocolate pieces the flavor faithfully follows the nose the body is hearty for the style and the mouthfeel is sticky sweetness galore
4273,Moment Of Clarity,5,milkshake quality truly delicious
4274,Moment Of Clarity,4.28,look  really nice black with a lasting tan head rimming and lacing smell  maple forward with coffee second then chocolate taste  nice blend between chocolate coffee and maple feel  medium full body creamy light carb overall  another fantastic non ba stout by treehouse
4275,Moment Of Clarity,4.72,from a 16oz can dated 111122 into a tulip can message yes yes yes  pours a thick opaque black with about one finger of brown head incredible retention ok lacing  powerful aromas of hazelnut coffee chocolate dark chocolate and maple syrup  taste follows in reverse chocolate and maple up front with coffee in the background light roasty bitterness  thick fullbodied wet mouthfeel light bitter aftertaste smooth drinking low carbonation  dont sleep on tree houses stouts this is fabulous
4276,Moment Of Clarity,4.27,16 oz can poured into a willi becher glass pours an opaque nearblack with a large beige head aroma and flavor feature sweet maple syrup milk chocolate dark roasted malts and coffee its a decadent stout and for me is just a touch too sweet or maybe im not quite in the mood its delicious regardless smooth velvety full mouthfeel overall a great beer
4277,Moment Of Clarity,4.09,16 oz can from the brewery canned 91622  pours jet black with half inch think dark tan colored head that fades into a thin ring around the collar mildly roasty coffee aroma with milk chocolate taste is similar fairly sweet fuller bodied slick feel overall very good but i think a bit stronger coffee flavors would help balance the sweetness
4278,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.79,this is probably the first beer im reviewing that you could consider a holy elixir as abbaye de brogne is a brewery located in an abbey in belgium since st peter appeared to g√©rard de brogne a nobleman who lived around 20 km or so away from the abbey and instructed the knight to build an abbey to honor god  that story allegedly took place somewhere around 880 ad making this a very old abbey indeed  but in 2013 belgian brewmaster bruno deghorain along with his business partner gaby smet conceived a plan to set up a small brewery in the abbey with the intent to make abbey style belgian ales like they did in the days of yore  this beer trappistes rochefort 10 is part of that dream  is it any good is this a holy beer  lets find out  classification  its an ale and when it comes to belgian beers theres a few styles  here were enjoying a belgian quad which are rich strong ales with bold flavors typically theyre quite dark in color hovering around deep ruby reds and browns with garnet hues  in terms of taste theyre very sweet on the palate low bitterness but packing an abv that will getcha there  when it comes to beer belgian quads are some of my favorite beers next to stouts  color  caramel a deep caramel almost as if you left it on the burner a bit too long and it got dark brown nice hefty butterscotch colored head that lingers for a long time  aroma  very malty on the nose which is the dominant smell that im getting a little bit in the background is a faint hint of milk chocolate little bit of caramel and brown sugar  body  palate  malt and caramel on the palate theres a faint spritz of clove that i taste little bit of a fruity taste that comes in almost like wine in a sense i do want to stress its quite mild in that fruity taste which i guess is that faint hint of citrus that im attributing to these particular kind of hops that they use  in terms of mouthfeel its pretty dense almost like cocacola in that sense very smooth even for the abv of 116 and fizziness of the beer  finish  it ends on a belgian malty dark chocolate sorta finish this beer lives and dies by its malt character  conclusion  this is a heavy beer thats akin to snuggling up in your favorite blanket and bunny slippers and sitting by the fire it lives and dies by its rich malty flavor that hangs around  i definitely do not recommend this beer for a refreshing drink this is more of an experience a beer you savor  as far as holy well ill leave that judgment to those more suited to make that call as im not particularly religious  but i bet if jesus had a signature beer i bet this would be his beer of choice  as far as myself this has shot up to one of my favorite beers of all time and this brewery became one of my favorite breweries of all time theyre a gem only issue though is availability and price if you can find it they are pricey so if youre after a nice beer on a budget might want to look elsewhere  but you definitely get what you pay for this beer is wonderful  until next time  cheers
4279,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.31,pours a clear brown color big caramel head formation with good retention malty chocolate on the nose caramel taste mild warmth smooth mouthfeel especially for the abv a delicious classic beer
4280,Trappistes Rochefort 10,5,one of the best dark beers out there
4281,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.5,smell of caramel and brown sugar taste that follows just as promised with a wellcarbonated and spritzy body of brown sugar caramel some clove a great quad
4282,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.24,pours a translucent rich brown with a fizzy cola head that settles to a thick 05 coaster with very good retention and lacing nose is baked brown bread prune raisin date baking spice hop spice light alcohol cinnamon fruit cake taste has moderate boozesoaked fruit sweetness treacle spiced red wine spiced hop on the finish with a lingering sweet booziness mouthfeel has moderate weight and light fizzy carbonation far more mild than westy 12 in terms of its fruity booziness with much more spice and hop character
4283,Trappistes Rochefort 10,3.18,apparently this is one of the best beers in the worldso reviewing again many think that it is better than westerveleren 12  aroma is nothing special similar to a canned pelforth brune lots of large bubbles not as beautiful as westerverelen or a guinness and definitely not a chouffee ipa or duvel tripel hop but as the froth reduces it improves  the best thing about this beer is the hop aftertaste its one of the best mouthfeels of any beer really amazing but it doesnt compare with a chouffe ipa in terms of flavour for me
4284,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.38,allowed to acclimate to 50f a little too cold but i let it warm more and poured into a chimay goblet  pours a hazy carob brown with lighter sediment floating around and a tan quickly dissipating tan head forgot to pay attention to how tall  initial aroma is a slight smell of high alcohol with a hefty dose of yeast and malt slight notes of milksemisweet chocolate wafted around before i smelled it directly returning for a second round of smelling i notice a slight note of grass a third round reminding me of a general whiskey smell  initial taste is again alcohol followed by malt followed by milksemisweet chocolate followed by light alcohol burn all over the tongue but concentrated in the middle third and fourth sips yield raisin andor generic dark dried fruit notes upfront as well as revealing a sweetness similar to the natural sweetness of dried fruit sipping after that uncovered a spiciness that comes before the sweetness combined with the warmth from the alcohol it feels very sensible i have to admit that for me personally it becomes harder to drink as it warms more because i have a hard time with spirits and the alcohol in this one is not hidden but its still got fantastic flavor  mouthfeel is smooth although a little thin and the carbonation disappears  it tastes like a fireplace super cozy and tastes like home kind of beer this is the perfect beer to drink while wearing a cotton sweater by a fireplace or a library or den  its expensive but it can be justified because its excellent and has a high abv will absolutely be purchasing again as well as recommending and purchasing the others in the line
4285,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.9,one of the very best in the world outstanding one of the best and likely the best monastic belgium triple its been around for several hundred years but its not for the faint of heart a serious amount of alcohol here and does not go good with anything but monk bread but a perfect beer if love a great ale made the old way on open vats or a monk sworn to celibacy
4286,Trappistes Rochefort 10,5,truly world class this beer lives from his malts multi faceted experience starts with banana goes to bread and caramel at the end superior carbonation one of the best non hoppy brews in the world
4287,Labatt Max Ice,4.57,sunday afternoon november 2022  on a cold rainy day its time for some ice beer poured aggressively into tall cylindrical pint glass ice cold from a frosty tall boy can a very sleek industrial look to the can with a name like maximum ice we could be talkng about close to anything here maximum ice poured aggressively into a tall cylindrical pint glass this lager beer is an aureate bronze with subdued carbonation from the pouring style atop the brew sits a sticky service envelope white head with big bubbles from the sugar used it dissipates slowly and laces the glass well its a nice looking cold beer under the honker aromas of wet brown bread fresh sourdough white salt crackers and a pinch of honey the malt and bittering galena hops hit and create a pleasent fresh aroma similar to a walk in refidgerator maximum ice tastes of light caramel english biscuits and a touch of table sugar the hops bitter the beer and add some astringency and needed dryness a highly drinkable lager beer of the ice beer family maximum ice has a refreshing and warming collection of light candied malts and well hidden alcohol its a nice beer as we huddle in its a solid representitive of its style i can certainly see this ice beer pairing well with some ball park hot dogs or a huge bag of potato chips
4288,Labatt Max Ice,2.66,got this in a 24oz can and it was in a cooler at the bottom of all the ice drank it directly from the can but poured some into a glass first not so bad iced cold definitely quenches the thirst or to have with burgers or hot dogs
4289,Labatt Max Ice,3,i love when pompous beer people rate cheap swill in depth always good for a laugh now dont get me wrong i love beer and i love drinking top quality brews but theres nothing wrong with slamming cheap strong beer and catching a buzz with your buds looks like bubbly piss stinks like green apple taste like nickels in sugar water but will do the trick and fast tastes like nothing after 3 of them anyway drink up and have a good time
4290,Labatt Max Ice,3.62,poured from a 24oz can into a forager pint glass pours a standard deep gold with a frothy white head strong corn or grain on the nose drinks heavy which at 8 is certainly expected but this is a hearty lager for sure price to abv though its hard to beat this one
4291,Labatt Max Ice,1.57,this one poured very bubbly and fizzy at first and then settled immediately into pond water the color is a weak and tepid clear straw yellow theres a lot of lacing  this smells horrid  wet stale leaves old bread metal solvent and green apple  this is absolutely disgusting and not even worth the 199 it cost its just super stale vegetal and weirdly sweet and bitter all at the same and in all the wrong places it definitely tastes like it brewed inside of an old work boot and left to ferment in the death valley sun  this is not drinkable not even in the least with a weird stale fruity bite on the back end  this is disgusting and should be drank by absolutely nobody
4292,Labatt Max Ice,1.46,well ill first say that i had this at a quite warm temperature so i admit that its certainly warmer than ideal however i drink a lot of beer at rather warm temperatures though and they still can get good ratings  anyway the smell was like a cheap beer weak standard beer smell mixed with a bit of damp socks andor urine i suppse some corn too which is maybe a bit different depending on what you think a typical cheap beer smells like  the pour was very bubbly with a huge head that dissipated extremely quickly and eventually left no head nor lacing at all after some sips not even around the edges of the glass temperature could play a factor in this but still i dont think ive ever seen a beer that this has happened with  the color was typical yellow like pee with big bubbles everywhere like fresh carbonated soda  the mouthfeel was rather hollow it had very prickly carbonation like a fresh carbonated soda but it didnt maintain its powerfoam with some swishes  taste was metallic very strong metallic taste watery i guess a lack of flavor and otherwise just plain lacking or dare i say bad while there was certainly some hops in here it wasnt especially noticeable nor was it a kind that tasted particularly good nor interesting in any way to me just kind of generic bitternesshopiness there wasnt much of maltiness taste to me either or at least there was a lack of complexitybody to any maltiness that was there i did quite easily notice multiple times a bit of corn if youve ever been to a brewerydistillery that uses corn fermentation you should know what i mean but i suppose even eating fresh corn might give a bit of a similar taste while senses can sometimes be deceivingwrong i believe that this beer must have been fortified with a cornbased lowfiltration alcohol otherwise i dont know why id be tasting any corn in this am i crazy to say this i dont know if thats something thats ever done heck maybe its a beer made mostlyexclusively from corn is that possible because thats kind of what it tastes like  i poured it from a 473 ml can and also drank most straight from the can which some might say contributed to the metallic taste but i dont believe in that sort of thing i dont find that cans affect the flavor in any sort of significant way especially not to this extent the last beer i had as a draft from a bar and it tasted very metallic and bad like this as well which is an interesting coincidence it might have been labatt beer even for all i know as it was just the house draft i think the metallic taste is due to the carbonation carbonic acid and not being masked enough by any other flavors another way to describe it would perhaps be like a mild sodium bicarbonate solution or club soda mix a bit of really cheap lowfilteredunfiltered corn vodka with some club soda and youd probably be getting close to the taste of what im predominately feeling here obviously thats a bit of an exaggeration though   unsurprisingly the 7 abv isnt well hidden as its an extremely prominent flavor as well i do like that it has high abv though as ive found that i generally do like beers that have higher abv which is why i thought id give this a shot however while it is a low price point for relatively high alcohol content my goto cheap highabv beer is miles away better than this faxe strong at least where i live canada faxe is essentially the same price per ml as this right around the bottom of what i think the minimum legal price is considering the abv or at least around the minimum of whats commercially viable in the country as well considering that theyre individually canned and individually sold although i suppose some are sold in packs as well i wasnt expecting anything from faxe strong but i was actually surprised at it being very good its one of my favorite reasonablyprice high abvbeers right under most of the stuff that unibroue produces although unibroue comes at a higher price point still wellpriced  because of how much i disliked it or rather how i disliked pretty much every aspect of it im not sure how to even rate this all i can say is that its probably worse than anything commercial that ive had before and is right around the bottom just probably not worst possible im sure its possible to scrape lower without getting into noncommercial or spoiledskunked beers  i dont know if this is a pro or a con but i got to enjoy the beer over a long period of time due to it not being in any way delicious  so really anywhere between a 1 and a 175 out of 5 seems reasonable to me the main thing that you take from this is that in most citiess there should be no reason to buy this when there are better alternatives at least at other stores
4293,Labatt Max Ice,3.53,24 ounce can into lager glass canned on 4202018 pours crystal clear deep golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation aromas of cracker corn white bread dough toasted biscuit light honeynuttiness and mild herbalgrassy earthiness a bit of fruitymetallic aromas but not overwhelming mostly went away as it warmed nice an pleasant aromas with bready malt corn and mild earthy hop notes with solid strength taste of cracker corn white bread dough toasted biscuit light honeynuttiness and mild herbalgrassy earthiness very mild herbal grassy spicy bitterness on the finish lingering notes of cracker corn white bread dough toasted biscuit light honeynuttiness and herbalgrassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit nice robustness of bready malt corn and mild earthy hop flavors with a nice maltbitterness balance and zero cloyingastringent flavors after the finish very clean on lager flavors with minimal fruity notes present lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness medium carbonation and mediumplus body with a smooth creamybreadygrainy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good increasingly warming 8 alcohol but not too rough of a finish overall this is a pretty good iced malt liquor all around good robustness of bready malt corn and mild earthy hop flavors very smooth and easy to drink for the abv with the mildly bitterboozy finish clean and rich barelygrain flavors with mild earthy hop balance not overdone on the corn adjuncts a nicely enjoyable and well made style example
4294,Labatt Max Ice,2.01,11318 24 oz can purchased at shop  save market 149 w tax poured a 24 ounce can over two pours canned on 11717 into a large flute beer is 80 abv not the 71 listed above pour clear yellow soapy cloudy white head which lasted a while nominal corn aroma and taste mild carbonation very thin mouth feel alcohol hidden until you consume the can very light drinking due to the light taste and thin texture
4295,Labatt Max Ice,1.55,im sure beer gets worse than this but im blessed that i have only had one that would fall to those murky depths this is in the bottom 2 worst beers ive ever had and its cutting it close this stuff is awful dont buy this  l  looks kinda offputting a yellow over carbonated pour with some soapy head resembles something between fresh urine and mop bucket water but its hard to actually fuck this up and it has a head so although its not a pretty sight its not as much of a warning sign as it should be  s  its the usual for a beer to rank poorly here because it has no discernible scent characteristics its not as usual for it to rank poorly because it actually smells unpleasant this beer has its standard malty and corny smell but intertwined with a chemical aroma that just doesnt belong there it keeps reminding me of cleaner for some reason  t  i could give the actual account of taste which is chemical doused corn and alcohol and not much else but really the way id honestly describe it is like drinking regularly bad massproduced beer by pouring it on a shirt youve worn for a long time and wringing it out its oddly accurate to what youd imagine and just as off putting as it should be aftertaste lingers for too long and is a haunting reminder of what just happened  f  admittedly the mouthfeel is not horrific its actually kinda average not that light little too carbonated smooth enough and goes down even if the entire trip is unpleasant but its not worth it  o  if youre not a broke alcoholic you can be doing better hell even if you are a broke alcoholic you probably can still do better i refuse to believe that there isnt better options than this such as drinking antifreeze or huffing your own excrement
4296,Labatt Max Ice,1.25,this is just plain awful it pours a golden color with a thick white head i put it in the freezer for a half hour it leaves little in the way of lacing there is nothing good here
4297,Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-M√§rzen,3.71,12oz bottle into a pint glass best by october 2023  reddish body head disappears quickly sweet caramely aroma which carries over into the taste seems a little dead not much body no aftertaste though
4298,Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-M√§rzen,3.75,thought this was very whatever for an oktoberfest its not a bad beer but the hype behind it left me very disappointed aroma is grassywet hay taste is not much like aroma its more in line with the traditional toastiness of oktoberfests but has a metallic thing going on that just hampers anything good going on here not bad but prefer ayinger
4299,Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-M√§rzen,3.92,was surprised to see this brew is specifically for american consumption i wonder why that said mine was nearing its expiration date and that may be affecting my thoughts here  i bit flat but still good
4300,Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-M√§rzen,3.82,very similar to heineken good beer overall
4301,Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-M√§rzen,3.6,better than most americans m√§rzens iv tried but 1 of my least favorite german m√§rzens available to me
4302,Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-M√§rzen,4.5,a pours a nice amber color with a white head beer gives off that classic appearance you would expect from an oktoberfest  s th beer as rich malty notes of toffee bread an toast beer also has some floral scents from the hops  t rich malt flavor notes of caramel and toffee hops provide a smooth balanced finish  mf medium bodied  o excellent oktoberfest beer
4303,Goudenband,3.71,330ml bottle into a straight glass 2022 blend  dark body red wine when held up to the light small off white head shrinks to a ring specks of lacing some cherry notes on the nose but aroma seems a little off sour cherry taste with some woody notes tart  sour finish abv felt would almost certainly improve with age best by march 2032
4304,Goudenband,4.69,375ml paper wrapped bottle  pours a dark rubydeep brown with 1 finger foam head that dissipates rapidly on the nose notes of dark fruit dried fruit and a hint of vinegar tastewise there is a high level of complexity with some really intense flavours the notes present in the eroma are magnified and a hint of spice and caramrl is also evident beautiful sweetness with a very tiny touch of tart incredible beer
4305,Goudenband,4.35,poured from a bottle into a snifter appearance  the beer pours a dark ruby brown red color with a small head of tan foam the head fades rather fast leaving a touch of foamy lace on the sides of the glass smell  the aroma of the brew is rather strong of dark fruit smells of plum and prune mixed with a touch of caramel apple and some cherry other aromas of candied sugar and yeast are there as well mixing in with some notes of roasted ready malts and brownies a hint of cola and spice are there as well creating a nice inviting aroma overall taste  thes taste starts out with a nice cherry and plum sweetness with some brown bread and candied sugar flavors there are nice roasty notes that get stronger toward the middle of the taste profile with them later fading a touch toward the end at the same time the dark fruit are joined by even more flavors with some raisin and apple coming along all throughout there is also some yeasty flavors and some light notes of sourness being of a tart raspberry and vinegar flavor a bit of coriander and some oak develop as well and with a tiny touch of char at the end one is left with a dark fruited very lightly soured and nicely balanced taste to linger on the tongue mouthfeel  the body of the brew is light and thinner with a carbonation level that is high for the style and the mix of flavors the feel is great and it makes for one dangerously easy sipper overall  a very nice and tasty lightly sour belgium ale one i will certainly seek out again
4306,Goudenband,4.23,750 ml bottle into a tulip glass 2016 edition had 111721  pours an opaque dark ruby with a two inch foamy head with very good retention and a good amount of foamy lacing aromas of cherries caramel malt oak some raspberries light apple smells lightly sour tastes lightly sour and tart flavors of cherries malt caramel oak light apple a hint of chocolate smooth a very good medium body well carbonated  above average for the style its a little lighter overall than others but also not as cherry focused lots of caramel and oak among other aromas and flavors very easy to drink too really enjoyable
4307,Goudenband,4.4,having this beer on draft at lizardville in bedford oh served to me in a tulip glass this beer draws a very dark copperamber color with a slightly offwhite had thats about an inch thick on first drawn and served head eventually settles to a medium sized ring lining the inside of the glass with some very small spots of surface foam barely any lacing to speak of aromas of some toasted bready malts notes of vinegar and lactate along with some fruity esters a very similar flavor profile with a toasted bready malt presence to start off with that has hints of molasses and brown sugar sweetness this is followed by some guide notes of apple cherry and dates along with a bit of lactate and vinegar that give it the nice sour note that blends so well with the molasses and brown sugar presence rounded out with a bit of a woody flavor although all of the different flavors are pretty subtle overall this beer has a pretty complex flavor profile that im enjoying quite a bit has a somewhat crisp also smooth just slightly prickly light to medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation has a nice long finish and all the different flavors linger nicely on my palate for a long time after each sip  eric
4308,Goudenband,4.42,had this on draft 9122  the hopleaf  mostly seethrough brownorange appearance  dark cherry lemon  mild vinegar notes in the nose  medium thin mouthfeel  dark cherry  lemon flavors up front artisanal vinegar  honey notes on the finish  elegant so easy to drink for a sour beer a stunner
4309,Goudenband,4.4,750ml bottle paper wrapped bottle caged and corked bottle label says blended in 2016 cap has imprinted date of 09 2026 ruby brown colored body with reddish backlit highlights thin light tan head which sticks around lacing sticks on all nondrinking sides aroma of red wine with earthy dark fruit taste is woody but also sweet from the fruit  apple cherry and raspberry has the caramel also aftertaste trails off quickly medium mouth feel and slightly smooth and syrupy carbonation is not a big deal here tastes like a cross between a merlot and cherry cola this aroma and taste expression is not often found slightly different flavor nuances are discovered with each sip really a treat very good paired with blue cheese
4310,Goudenband,3.31,on tap at brewery ommegang in cooperstown ny  this one pours a darkish murky brown color with a small head and not much lacing  this smells like damp wood cherry juice green apple pear and red wine vinegar  this is simultaneously too sweet and too vinegary for me  its kind of a cloying medicinal sweetness for me and when mixed with the old stale vinegar aspects it definitely clashes theres some nice woodiness and cherry skin but it just doesnt work out for me i know its a classic beer and maybe im missing out on something here but its just a contradictory set of flavors for me  this is medium bodied with a lower level of carbonation and a soft finish its not particularly sour by any means  i wanted to like this one a lot more but maybe its just not for me
4311,Goudenband,3.77,hard to tell exactly what it is trying to be although it grows on you i was hoping for more funk and candi sugar but it wasnt there probably would like it more after more tries
4312,Goudenband,3.75,330 ml bottle from the norwegian importer i could swear i had rated this beer before but apparently not dark reddish brown colour large beige head the aroma has first a whiff of smoke then notes of red wine red wine vinegar oak and horse stable pleasant flavour malty fruity and only moderately sour again notes of red wine red wine vinegar and oak hardly any noticeable hops still easy drinking due to the fruitiness the alcohol is well hidden nice one
4313,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.94,12oz bottle poured into a teku glass looks copper colored in the body with an off white head that sticks around a bit not a perfectly clear beer but looks still in the glass as far as carbonation smell is brown bread grain slight citrus from the hops taste is pretty well balanced you get the dark bread pepper spiciness from the malt coupled nicely with the grapefruit lemon pine from the hops these flavors seem to be well balanced with none really dominating feel is medium bodied with low level carbonation beer seems to linger a bit on the tongue overall i remember this beer very differently from before this is a very pleasant drink as it is substantial balanced and very good a bit different obviously due to the rye i enjoyed it
4314,Ruthless Rye IPA,4.71,its worth shelling out for the fan favorites dozen to get three bottles of this gem easily the best rye ipa ive come across please bring this back as a year round staple

4316,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.68,ruthless rye ipa  sierra nevada brewing co  iparye  a malty brown sugar and earthy rye aroma malt hefty with a nice earthy rye dryness and burnt caramel style sweetness in the finish smooth mostly with a slightly dry feel rye is a favorite adjunct within a classic malt heavy american ipa style
4317,Ruthless Rye IPA,4.58,phenomenal beer im sure the only reason i love it so much is because the rye flavor is rare strange blackpepper musk in smell and flavor overall a hyperexaggerated wheat ale if you took the wheat flavor of a redbrowncoloredrich ale and gave it steroids youd get this beer sidenote im seeing if this posts forgot to click submit and woke up next day to do so and said error no sign in even though i was

4320,Ruthless Rye IPA,4.63,pours copper like brown great clarity slight offwhite head builds quickly and sustains for quite some time collapses into a fat cohesive head that leaves some substantial lacing  the nose is so vibrant and lively spicy wood cedar like zesty character sappy orange citrus some vague and light floral character  taste is very rye forward and carries some toasted grain character rustic tasting in nature caramelized maltiness pine needles and orange citrus rind black pepper bite on the finish  medium light body classic smooth creamy sn carbonation the perfect kiss of malt sweetness that is then crushed by a spicy biting bitterness which then flips to absolutely dry clean finish

4336,Tecate Original,3.54,a true sleeper beer it shapes shifts drink from a can and its a thin mouthful but tasty smells like an average macro lager the recipe is german they settled mexico when it came to beermaking so grains hops apparent in that smell and taste pale mexican lager if you use a glass its a fullcaloried beer acting like a light beer i love the taste and there is a clean aftertaste the only catch is these need to be really cold the warmer the worse yes on of those beers i would urge all of you to keep rating it under 25 so it will never become cool and always be affordable
4337,Tecate Original,2.83,not a bad lawnmowinggrilling beer
4338,Tecate Original,4.54,this is a very good thirst quenching beer

4348,Medianoche - Coconut,4.23,thick syrupy sweetness
4349,Medianoche - Coconut,4.37,this is my first time ever having a stout from weldwerks and its my first medianoche i dont even know if they make stouts that arent in that series this is really quite good im a coconut fiend and this doesnt disappoint its essentially liquid dessert  milk chocolate coconut to me its sweet but not diabetic sweet its less sweet than coconut vibes shared aka side project but its also less coconut forward coconut vibes is also liquid milk chocoluate coconut but it has a noticeable coconut pop this is so integrated that the coconut is integrated but not popping id prefer the popping but this is way easier to drink than that if i was only going to buy 1 id probably buy coconut vibes only because of that noticeable coconut pop god i love coconut
4350,Medianoche - Coconut,2.28,this one pours a fairly flat looking inky and gloopy looking black color with no head or lacing  this smells like pure sugar cheap melted chocolate milkshake coconut syrup and caramel  this is actually disgusting this series used to be some of the best barrel aged stouts in the country but weldwerks has just gone off the deep end with these its just tastes like sweet stout glue basically  its basically liquified black sugar  its basicallyyou get it right its just way too sweet and cloying with barely any barrel theres not even that much coconut its just way too sweet of a base  just loads of cheap overbearing chocolate character  this is too thick and not drinkable at all with very little carbonation theres not much booziness but thats maybe the only single kind of good thing i can say about this  what happened to you weldwerks where did you go so wrong
4351,Medianoche - Coconut,4.69,this was scrumptious  wow so much coconut on the nose and palate plus dark chocolate nice roast bourbon decent sweetness without being cloying very thicc mouthfeel great barrel roasty coconut finish
4352,Cable Car,4.55,2020 vintage  clear golden coloration soft white head of carbonation settles in a thin ring around the beer  the nose opens with a musty sweetness and candied lemon peel really nice balance of funk and citrus  the palate is tart and predominantly fruity with a bit of a tightening pucker on the back of the palate and a long mildly acidic finish nice juiciness to the overall profile  a touch of dryness with a soft finish and gentle lingering tannin
4353,Cable Car,4.53,2019 version drank 061922 out of a hill farmstead bulbous wine glass straw color with very delicate islands of head but other than that not to much there not too much nose either funky and acidy taste strong very pungent strong and tasty pretty amazing beer just wow
4354,I.C. Light,3.05,on tap pretty decent for a light adjunct lager clear yellow gold with a solid white cap that fades to a small bubble ring without lacing  pretty standard nose is barely enough to make me feel it wont be too sweet despite faint corn being about all i can pick out turns out the nose was right  a balanced beer without a lot to it but just enough to be refreshing and a tad dry
4355,I.C. Light,5,best tasting light beer i have ever had nice light beer taste and very refreshing on a hot summer day without the calories or alcohol
4356,I.C. Light,2.91,ok my score is skewed a bit because i consumed this beer at a penguins hockey game the can it was served in was a bright yellow and celebrated pittsburgh sports championships drank it during the first period this beer is what it is it is refreshing and easy to drink but it lacks much in the way of smell and taste anyway had a great time drinking it with my nachos wish the pens had won
4357,I.C. Light,3.81,12 oz can 0542 2017 purchased single off shelf at shangys yesterday poured into a 14 oz mug  l polishedclear extrapale gold liquid with a faint cloud of speckled sediment curiously gloriously snow drifty foam like whipped egg white keeps a collar big ring of lace at the top  what  s herbal earthy overtone popcorn trails around the perimeter with a vaguely poundcakey interior which sort of also comes across as cornbread  t semi corncolored dry grainy foundation maybe the slightest hint of sulfur bold but bland nofrills pils malt in the aftertaste accented by some grassy and mildly spicy hops and maybe a slight residual soapy note  f lightbodied snappy and subtly sharp lively carbonation with a bite up front as well as a soft round swell before it finishes relatively level and dry delicate spicy hopalc warmth  o eww was this a 2017 can never got around to trying this when in pittsburgh last august this was my first chance its a bit aggressive for a light beer but i could get down with it 1961
4358,I.C. Light,2.24,24oz can into a pint glass freshness dating unclear  pale watery golden body with light carbonation head quickly fizzes away no lacing  there is hardly any aroma a little malt if i try hard  on tasting well hardly any taste bland thin light  mouth closer to thin than medium finish a little off as well  overall pretty poor beer nothing to it may as well drink water if you care about carbs and calories most of this is heading for the drain
4359,I.C. Light,1,a homeless guy we gave a case too refused to drink it
4360,I.C. Light,2.18,tastes like weird promiscuous wood
4361,Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e,4,poured into a chalice color is black head is light tan and presents with the nitro super fine bubbles on that initial pour  smell is lightly boozy upfront quickly overtaken by the creaminess  big lactose really has that creamy aroma some backing chocolate and roast  taste is similar but the booziness is a backing flavor big cream lactose lighter chocolate some roast booze flavor really emanates a thick cocktail like flavor  mouthfeel is low nitro effervescence strongthick creamy sweetness limited bitterness and even limited drying from the strength  overall a big creamy sweet brew that gives off a creamy cocktail vibe white russianesque
4362,Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e,3.84,this is just sweeter than the hot cocoa one but thats really about the whole super prevalent difference i feel like trying this one made me like them both a little less sweet boozy run of the mill southern tier is super overrated as a whole to me theres great desert beers and pastry stouts everywhere try something new i will say this shits on their ipas in the since these are better at being stouts than the ipas are at being ipas at least this is supposed to be sweet
4363,Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e,4.62,experience says that this is among the best of the desert beers now its time for a critical review two twelve ounce cans are opened and all of the contents of one and most of the contents of the second can are fitted instead a clear glass imperial pint mug theres an amazing vanilla smell in the air and the beige head preventing the entire drainage of the second can is one of the tightest and enduring in the beer world it adorns a beautiful black coffee colored liquid thats opaque but reasonably bright behind the sharp vanilla nose hit found is creamy sweetness kind of like the smell gotten from an aerosol whipped cream for its color theres very little reference to roasted malt there is some roasted malt bitterness in the taste so much so that it detracts from the intended target but its a mild infraction as theres enough smooth and creamy character to carry most of the taste actually the stout bitterness doesnt really kick until the finish until then this is an amazing liquid reminder of a pleasantly sweet desert without the crusty covering theres great glass lacing and a well disguised 10 abv maybe not perfect but this is one great desert beer
4364,Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e,4.05,650 ml bottle as southern tier imperial cr√®me br√ªl√©e stout courtesy of cardinal pub  bar stavanger abv is 100 pitch black colour big tan head intense aroma of cr√®me br√ªl√©e and vanilla from the moment you open the bottle amazing the smell includes caramel of course  but also chocolate and mild coffee the sweet flavour is first and foremost cr√®me br√ªl√©e again but also roasty notes of strong coffee dark bitter chocolate and liquorice also some hoppy bitterness in the finish warming mouthfeel an incredible dessert beer
4365,Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e,4.45,looks at 96 ozs should have poured it into a smaller glass lol nice thick creamy head about 12 inch tall great lacing on the glass smooth tan on top and strong black coffee color on the bottom smell and taste this beer really does resemble creme br√ªl√©e vanilla and burnt sugar on cream great combination feel nitro makes it smooth and soft overall this its one of the easiest beers i have ever had the pleasure of drinking bumped the oa score down some because of the short pour should have ben packaged in a can the size of a pint at least it would have come closer to filling my glass i would definitely drink this one again but as an after dinner drink like desert
4366,Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e,4,sweet and choclaty to the nose sweet chocolate taste with a vanilla finish great dessert beer
4367,Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e,3.83,pours a cola brown color with a very creamy beige head 14 cap was present for the duration  nose is seriously sweet with caramel brown sugar sweet cream and vanilla bean  flavor begins with caramel and vanilla roasted coffee flavor comes on to offer some balance boozy alcohol warmth plays in the background the whole time  finish leans toward the bitter from the coffee the sweetness and alcohol warmth are still there though  viscous body and subtle carbonation let this one hang on the palate a little but its a desert beer in every way so this wasnt surprising  not a daily drinker good to keep a few on hand for the colder months though
4368,Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e,4.34,pours quite dark and fairly clear appropriate head aroma is dark roasted malts and vanilla actually tastes like a creme br√ªl√©e  complete with the sugary vanilla and the burnt sugar on the finish nicely done carbonation is appropriate obverse a nicely crafted beer hits all the marks  112220 bomber no date at least 5 years old 45 rating
4369,Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e,2.21,the initial smell is quite nice but then you take a sip utterly disgusting i tried a second can same the sheer number of positive reviews required me to sign up and leave a review im still trying to get the after taste out of my mouth absolutely do not recommend
4370,Kaliber,3.55,from a bottle pours a nice dark and clear amber color when held up to the light i see a decent amount of carbonation bubbles rising in the glass the head that forms is slightly off white and fairly thick  2 finger decent head retention and some pretty nice lacing on the glass nose is malty and somewhat one note  rye bread this is what i get and i get a lot of it taste  is like the nose  rye bread the rye really seems to have 2 phases to it it starts out a bit mellow then it really builds on the back theres a slight earthy flavor that also shines through lighter bodied but not watery crisp and bubbly feeling damn i really like this beer very well made overall and this is one i will be revisiting again and again
4371,Kaliber,3.09,12 ounce bottle poured into a stemmed straight sided glass  a decent alternative for when you need to limit your alcohol consumption it is very malty it seems the lack of alcohol allows the malt sweetness to go unchecked and the taste less sharp and less dry than i would expect for a lager it is reminiscent of some high malt lagers ive had kirin ichiban comes to mind bready with corn aroma and flavor coming out as it warms mouthfeel is light and clean but not crisp  i is a compromise and i tried to keep that in mind while rating
4372,Kaliber,2.81,tried this for the first time despite reading a fred eckhardt column over a decade ago in which he said he enjoyed kaliber on his nondrinking day  anyway decent looking tawny appearance a small head sticks around throughout the experience smells like grocery store brand wheat bread and a hint of stale apple juice taste reminds me of some other guinness irish ales with a tangy sourlike acidity and brown bread underneath near medium mouthfeel maybe a little more body than your domestic light beer  overall not good but not half bad either it doesnt stand up against the latest na creations from craft breweries but if your distributor only has a couple na options and youre on the look out its not the worst sixer you could scoop up
4373,Kaliber,3.78,am on a 6 week na period due to a medication and have tried 6 or so na beers so far to me this has been by far the most drinkable will keep this in my overall lineup for after my med is over especially as a hot weather thirst quencher
4374,Kaliber,2.7,330 ml bottle l1326ggoo4 fl purchased single off shelf poured into a 14 oz mug  l polishedclear orangetinged gold liquid twofingerhigh tight rocky foam stand some lace keeps a thin cap  s a malt character ive yet to encounter almsot has sweet potato pie crust or ginger snap baked and spiced notes its not bready nor biscuity  t the flavor is not much different yuck awful not beer like and especially not like other nas ive had old wheat bread and apple cider quite dry with those apple crumb notes lingering  f lightbodied buoyant without much drag and roundness but with just enough texture to give mild fulfillment carbonation is soft  o smell and taste alone this is arguably the worst na on the market dont know how fresh this bottle is nov 21 cant they do better than this ill give em this its unique 1915
4375,Kaliber,2.3,weird drinkable but not good tastes like a cider sort of
4376,Kaliber,1.21,first of all i can not imagine how any of the other ratings found the good things they said especially the ones rating it as sweet this garbage is sour and horrible i believe it was spoiled it tasted so bad i was afraid i was going to get sick happily i awoke not sick so hopefully that possible danger has passed it did have a sort of a weird smell that made me think i might be drinking something possibly sweet but once it hitmy tongue all that disappeared the only thing impressive about this is that it would make a decent beer to serve for the purposes of a movie that required a bubbly drink with a thick head it bubbles with a thick gooey foam that just lingers in a frightful manner given the horrible taste after smelling and tasting this swill i began to wonder if the foam was part of some spoilage feature i read reviews from the top in complete disbelief until i ran into 2 in 2011 that captured the essence of what i would like to say horrible many na better
4377,Apricot Funky Wit,4.71,sour pairs well with apricot smells deliciously floral and fruity mild carbonation taste the different stages of an apricot as if taking a bite out of a ripe apricot mild then sour and full fruit impact at end
4378,Apricot Funky Wit,4.21,really tasty wild beer here woody and vinous and really quite a bit more sour than i expected it to be more sour than i remember from the original unfruited edition for sure its really acidic bacterial sharp and one glass felt like plenty the apricot in it is amazing though natural ripe fuzzy and easy to appreciate in aroma and flavor it also is really light on the grain side lighter than other wit types most of the time almost as much pils or something as there is wheat and less raw too this is really mild and clean there so the fruit really pops in this a good amount of oak some lemon accent to the apricot and decidedly not peach or nectarine or anything its all apricot thats how pure it is in the taste here with the name funky wit i could have handled a little more bretty wild character rather than this overt acidity its mature and all and its not without some of that but its the sourness that dominates for me a little too aggressive if i am being critical but the flavors and texture of this are still fantastic high carbonation is awesome on it and the dryness seems almost impossible given how much fruit runs all the way through it delicious looking to source the others in this series now
4379,Apricot Funky Wit,4.3,had on tap cloudy orange body with a white cap very eye catching definitely an american take on the style for how sour it is and the oak presence but the wheat funk flowers and fruit lemon esters all make their signature appearance in the aromas amongst the neo sour fruits of apricot clementine and peach taste is more uniform and not unreasonably sour take all of the sour fruit with a huge oak backing to start then hits with the traditional wit funk flowers and wheat to create a sour finish with a comparative hardy balance feel is oak laden with sour funk wheat and fruit esters textures incorporated a new world wit
4380,Apricot Funky Wit,4.15,rating for style i am going with this being more of a belgian sour or american wild ale than a witbier  quite a bit of yeast sediment in this 22 month old bottle with a careful pour and minimal sediment the brew is lemon yellow and appears translucent although there is no avoiding a fair bit of sediment head production and retention are weak but not poor for the style  on the nose displays notes of coriander orange apricot bubblegum hay and very light tannins  despite the restrained nose this is a very sour brew on the palate with loads of tannins vinegar tart overripe apricots oak orange peel coriander and very musty earthy hay a great balance between funk sourness and tartness that few brews manage although it could benefit from more representation of the apricot  fairly strong puckering from the lactolike sourness slick feel
4381,Flower Power,3.87,an attractively thick head sits atop a lovely hazy orange body floral aroma with some honey lemon blossoms  pine tar mildly sweet with a fairly bitter finish hoppy flavor with citrus pear  pine tar nice feel im not a fan of ipss but this one is good
4382,Flower Power,4.07,pours a rich gold with a rocky white two finger head light citrus aroma maybe some what floral probably has more but my nose sucks taste shows some citrus peel a bit of grassiness and some biscuity malt lightmedium bodied with a dry finish and mild carbonation very tasty warm weather ipa ill be getting this again
4383,Flower Power,3.99,ahhhhh i get the west coast pine and grapefruit notes with a touch of new school floral character just the right bitterness to finish it off this was a fun one
4384,Flower Power,5,pleasant surprise so good
4385,Flower Power,4.5,look best looking ipa i have seen in years perfect sustained head vivid sunset  smell balanced floral immediately subsides and becomes a manly almost malty whiff  taste really balanced middle of the tongue mellow and then stays balanced w wonderful bitters  feel smooth start to finish  overall i think this might be the best most balanced beer not just ipa i have had in a long time the brewers know what they are doing and you sense they are deferring getting out of the way of the ingredients in this masterpiece
4386,Flower Power,3.75,pours a hazy gold hoppy aroma big dank hop body fades to a mild bitterness thick and syrupy an old school ipa
4387,IPA,4.7,this has been a goto for many years once it was on the hairy edge of too hoppy now it seems to be middleoftheroad that way bottles are better than cans
4388,IPA,4.36,doesnt look or smell great but makes up for it in taste
4389,IPA,4,classic ipa at a great value what more is there to say
4390,IPA,4.14,a really solid american ipa always a reliable choice
4391,IPA,4.09,pours a crystal clear vibrant golden amber from the can two months old huge fluffy 3 head excellent retention and lacing hard to find any faults in terms of looks nose is orange grapefruit and lemon peel pine and resin green pepper and some slight astringency nose isnt as rich and expressive as say stone ipa but it still hits the classic west coast notes plus a little spice taste follows the nose  citrus sweetness orange grapefruit and mild malt and bitterness juicy candied orange and grapefruit peels dominate finish is a little rough around the edges green pepper overall like the nose its most reminiscent of a dialeddown stone mouthfeel is moderate with a touch of softness as far as mass market pounders go this is one of the best
4392,IPA,4.23,can dated 412 pours a classic medium golden and clear ignoring the chill that adds condemnation to the glass on a humid day a classic citrus pith and pine with a little more of the latter comes out even on a cold beer at this initial lower temperature the grain cones out as lightly toasted bread crust backed by a husky to piney bitterness evolving more towards the classic hop flavor the beer finished in a classically wcipa fashion at this point  the beer gets a little bit of rye bread crust in the aroma as it warms but a larger amount of pine relative to the colder version the pine also starts to take hold of the flavor profile and im starting to lose any citrus vibe in either attribute a quarter glass into the pour  feel is medium leaning light even a tad more so considering the state of ipas today upon reaching what i would call a proper temp the aroma gains a slight floral vibe pairing with grapefruit pith more than pine interesting how it seems to have evolved for me today the taste also turns a bit pithy in the middle while continuing to finish a bit piney  a nice pretty much classic ipa that seems just slightly less brash than i recall from the era when this was a new thing to me
4393,IPA,4.06,lagunitas brewing ipa  62  originally tasted on tap  gcbf14  this review from a 650 ml bottle  500 ml cans apour is a light gold from the tapbottlecan to a golden amber in the glass with a small size white head leaving a fine spotty lace along the samplertulipspiegelau spiney resin  so west coast tbig tasting california ipa  decent bitter swallow mfok carbonation  feels full bodied ovgood beer even at a 199  can prost lampertland
4394,IPA,2.72,april 2023 industrial noncraft beer produced for my european market by heineken ned it can be found in 355 cl bottles and the price fluctuates between 260 and 290 in local supermarkets which in these parts are not a sales channel for craft beers sometimes it is more fragrant and gives a greater sense of freshness sometimes it seems more stale even the vivacity of carbonation is sometimes more lively than others but on average it has a sufficient fizz not an irresistible scent on the nose in which herbaceous and malt notes are felt deep golden color almost orange abundant foam soft but persistent mediumlight body partly malty at the beginning with hints of caramel then hops take over with a fair amount of bitterness main hints of resin citrus and herbaceous pine needles dry fairly bitter sometimes there is a ferrous note one of the least worst industrial beers the intensity medium but perceptible even after drinking of the final bitterness is the thing that most distinguishes it from the other industrial products available on the shelves drinkable but soulless
4395,IPA,3.85,bottle pour on 04032022  color bright amber quite beautiful in natural sunlight head 1 finger of lace with a mix of large and small bubbles which slowly settles into a gentle ring of bubbles along the edges of the glass i admit this was poured into a belgian glass aroma pine predominant with lesser but balancing notes of malt and faintly bread taste a dance of piney hop and classic malt lighter in mouthfeel but well developed in taste with no offnotes  overall drinkable and balanced less heavy but in the same vein as than bells twohearted or cigar city jai alai but heavier and with a better malt backbone than a typical session ipa  drinkable and enjoyable
4396,Wintervention,4.02,16oz can with no date opened 122522 2 finger beige frothy head with great retention no lacing dark brown body with amber highlights spicy nose full of clove light cinnamon nutmeg and dark fruit malt brown sugar baking spices  all deftly balanced and very tasty medium body and somewhat creamy mouthfeel in a moderate length and lightly sweet finish 10 isnt apparent at all at the sip but definitely warming very good
4397,Wintervention,4.02,what can i say peticolas is a brewery that grows on me when i started this beer i couldnt help feeling that it lacked something as a winter warmer the body was thinner than i expected and yet it still managed to coat the tongue the aroma lacks something but the more i smell it the more i notice the taste seemed a bit light on the malt and roast with little spice but as i drink the layers keep sticking around and the flavor has developed into a deep rich spice with refreshing bitterness after each sip  its a good beer probably the best winter warmer ive had even if i didnt believe it at first
4398,Wintervention,4.19,had this beer at the craft beer cellar in dallas on tap poured into a small snifter dark grayish brown color with good head and excellent curtain lacing warm spice smell and taste cinnamon allspice ginger nice comforting beer that nicely fits the description of winter warmer
4399,Wintervention,4.87,best winter beer in dfw extremely aromatic spices everywhere slightly hotjust enough
4400,Wintervention,4, malts and sweets  graham cracker and cloves i also get apricots cinnamon nutmeg spices and predominantly chocolate caramel and toffee follows the heat is almost not there but it sneaks in at the back  mouth is smooth and velvety has a thicker body with a buttery slide very nice  this is a wonderful beer i love winter warmers when theyre wellmade this is a good double winter warmer if you will the flavors just dance around nicely and the complexity of the beer really stands out
4401,Miller High Life,2.78,might be the best cheap us massmarket beer for the price pretty ok it is actually almost just as good as some micropale lagers that local microbreweries are producing as nostalgia beers now now days but for half the price
4402,Miller High Life,3.09,great cheap beer american style too much corn but balanced with some acidity and carbonation not offensive one of the better cheap american beers and it has been around a long time which states a lot
4403,Miller High Life,3.42,poured transparent honey amber color and was topped by a tall nearly white dense head of foam aroma lost on my covid damaged nose the taste was not really strong enough for distinct flavors but the malts definitely carried the load i found no noticeable hops influence still for an aal it isnt too bad the feel is great actually active carbonation keeps it lively and refreshing oa there i gave it a fair shake maybe this will be the last one i drink its certainly the last one i will buy
4404,Miller High Life,5,gods nectar go to beer for a 6 beer and shot when i find it in those little nipple glass bottles i am feral  perfect
4405,Miller High Life,1.61,this is a beautiful looking beer it is well carbonated and keeps a frothy white head these are its best qualities and beyond then it is truly an awful beer it has no malt character and almost no bitterness i would guess about 6 or 7 ibus the aftertaste is carbonated water on the bright side this is the beer that is going to help me cut down on drinking
4406,Miller High Life,1.73,tastes like maize and co2 basically a cornflavored seltzer
4407,Miller High Life,4,back in my early 20s whenever i would drink at home instead of going out to a house party or a dive bar miller high life and budweiser were my go to beers the taste has a rich creaminess to it at least that is what i get out of it i also love the design of the bottles it is a mixture of classy and cheesy that really appeals to me however i do prefer the taste out of the can more one of the most satisfying bottom shelf beers youll find its miller high life the champagne of beers  style american lager  tapcanbottle can  abv 46  rating 4
4408,Miller High Life,3.25,i have three guilty beer pleasures pabbs blue ribbon coors banquet and miller high life these are the beers that i drank in college and concerts have very fond memories they arent craft beer and they dont label themselves as craft beer great times

4412,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.38,many thanks to erland for sharing this one pkgd 111721 134 abv 12oz bottle pours out to a syrupy thick ink black forming a thick dark cocoa head with average retention sparse lacing the nose is definitely full of bourbon but on top of that classic expedition nose we all loveprunes dark chocolate raisins figs soy sauce and black walnut mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy dense bodied medium light carbonation 225 carbs or so taste is a recap of the nose the bourbon is well balanced with the other complex stuff going on here and gives it a more warming presence that traditional expedition bitterness is mild and earthy hops are kept in check by copious malts considering the rich complex malts there is no sourness or astringency herethis easily happens in lesser riss if the roasted malts are overdone one is enough its a heavy hitter and very rich this might be great over dark chocolate ice cream hrmmm might have to try that
4413,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.27,black in color with no light penetration theres a fingernail of brown around the rim the aroma is of piney hops and dark malt im tasting piney hops and sweet bourbon the mouth is thick and chewy

4415,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.33,i have to say i liked this one much better once it warmed up before it warmed up it there was a big chocolate taste with some barrel after it warmed the other flavors started to pop the chocolate faded a bit and vanilla and coffee flavors became more present the barrel also came to the forefront a bit thin but very good overall
4416,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.04,12 oz can from total wine and more in short pump va this is a oneofakind ale along with sculpin a goto beer for all times the ale pours a clear amber with a white foamy head and lacing the noticeable aroma is citrus mostly grapefruit is nicely balanced the mouthfeel is smooth with excellent body and texture the ale has a medium body with average carbonation
4417,Sculpin - Grapefruit,3.03,yet another beer that has been destroyed by being bought out pour is deep copper to light amber much deeper than i recall back in the day decent hop notes and some light lacing this is fresh beer yet offers no grapefruit notes that existed in the past taste is a bit malty subdued pleasant yet unexciting pleasant hop character on the nose yet not stellar finish is fairly soft for an ipa lacking the bitterness it is known for warming does bring out just a hint of grapefruit though it is fleeting at best touch of hop spice on the close a decent quaff but heading into the not worth the calories realm of once great beers who owns this brand now i dont know and they dont care utopia is behind us
4418,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.83,this beer is impossible to get hold off where i live its truly excellent and enhances the flavors of the sculpin with slightly sour but more refreshing notes
4419,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.15,my shock and horror to see that after all these years i hadnt reviewed sculpin grapefruit well no more i love this beer as grapefruit is a lovely way to compliment the biting hops of sculpin not for amateurs or posers and bmc drinkers heads will aspolode upon the first sip similarly to arrogant bastard keep this one away from the unsophisticated newbies
4420,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.56,had to have while visiting san diego perfect west coast ipa to drink while on the west coast perfect amount of grapefruit and perfect sipability to the whole brew
4421,Sculpin - Grapefruit,5,not much to say beer like this makes me hoppy absolutely delicious smell taste body is all 1010
4422,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.04,12oz can purchased off the shelf as part of a mixasix pack for 2 pkg 07apr22 so this is almost four months old  look pours a very pretty copper color almost completely clear just a very faint haze that appeared after i poured the bottom of the can there was a thick rocky offwhite head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer  smell i definitely smell the grapefruit aroma up front it smells nice other fruity caramelly and herbalvegetal notes but nothing distinctive besides grapefruit after delving into it i can detect nice apricot and orange zest aromas  taste its very tasty up front theres grapefruit flavor with a bit of acidity the mild gentle initial grapefruit flavor explodes into an oily bitter pithy profile that attacks the sides of the tongue and the back of the palate the finish is long piney resinous and bitter with lots of grapefruit peel and pith eventually i can detect a pleasant caramel malt sweetness after the bitterness subsides even though this beer is so bitter i feel like there is an element of balance to it because along theres also a lot of caramel malt to help counteract the strong bitterness  feel medium bodied with an appropriate level of carbonation someone oil slightly chewy mouthfeel  overall this has got to be one of the quintessential west coast ipas i tried regular sculpin ipa many years ago and i was utterly unprepared for how bitter it was this is also very bitter and i think that my palate has adjusted over the years and now embraces bitterness this beer requires a palate adjustment for many folks and thats okay because many folks palates and minds need to be adjusted its also nice to see that this beer can hold up to father time at almost four months old its still very aromatic and flavorful  grapefruit sculpin india pale ale with natural grapefruit flavors
4423,Sculpin - Grapefruit,1.36,i found the taste to be completely unpalatable way too bitter not very smooth hated it
4424,Bavaria 8.6 Original,3.05,march 2006 650 ml very dark blueish green bottle bought in france abv is 79 golden colour large lasting head decent lacing malty and fruity aroma with some alcoholic notes but not unpleasant hints of oak and leather flavour is very sweet but surprisingly it is not as repulsive as many other often less sweet golden strong lagers tolerable hops obviously contribute to a nearly acceptable balance moderate carbonation ive had worse beers
4425,Bavaria 8.6 Original,1.53,the local bottle shop near me stock some of these strong european lagers which are good on a friday night when you want to get your buzz on and not think too hard about the present future or past theyve started stocking this one so thought id pick up a can and give it a go  look clear very bubbly golden beer looking like a classic australian adjunct lager rather than a typical pale euro lager frothy white head that has more important places to be than my glass by the way its disappearing as i type this  smell strong alcohol whiff on the nose bitter grassy hops somewhat sour on the nose biscuit malt smells like a hangover in the making  taste sweet syrupy goo its like theyve poured a lot of simple syrup and mixed it with straight alcohol struggling to find anything positive about the flavour might be some hop extract in there somewhere but if it is theyve mixed with with simple syrup and turned it into a hop cordial  feel smooth not overly carbonated but sickly sweet  overall 20th review and this is the first one im proper regretting ive had oj strong and from memory thats more palatable this is just beer cordial i look on the can and sure enough it lists hop extract and glucose syrup 12 cans may get you buzzed but heck id rather drink a 6 pack of an average aussie adjunct lager than force myself to down this better drink it ice cold because once it warms up its going to be completely undrinkable  in a word yuck

4434,Tripel Karmeliet,4.52,i dont know what ive been doing but its definitely fucking around because this is genuinely my first time having this one and yet again in brussels it of course comes in proper glassware  the head is active as hell so there you can already see how perfectly designed the glass is because it contains it top to bottom while the body is a sparklingly clear wedding band gold  taste is more floral than i expect out of a tripel which is unique to me while still featuring some gently peppery phenols as well as some citrus peel and a touch of minerality its actually more beautifully bright of fruity characteristics like stonefruit but also honeysuckle its incredible  tripel karmeliet is one of most wonderfully expressive tripels ive ever had and i regret not having had one of these ages ago this could have changed my perspective of belgian ales so drastically and so much sooner hands down this is the best tripel on earth
4435,Tripel Karmeliet,4.49,a some chill haze on this burnt yellow color huge 34 finger off white rocky head  s sweet grains grass lemongrass band aid and some barn yard funk huge note of pear and green apple skin clove and cardamom pepper and a nice crusty bread backbone  t sweet grains grass and lemongrassjust like the nose big pear and green apple skin behind that cardamom and pepper follow along with a nice crusty loaf of country bread pepper and some belgian yeast spice a hint of banana and more grains  m medium mouthfeel with high carbonation  o world class tripel right here great earthy notes with a kiss of funk and grains

4438,Affogato,4.5,brew trillium brewing company  affogato  intro 750 mil poured into a tulip glass shared with a friend  appearance dark virtually black color ample head maybe 2 inches moderate lacing as we drank  smell coffee in the foreground followed by chocolate and vanilla  taste followed along with the smell coffee is not overpowering the chocolate lead up the flavor profile  mouthfeel medium mouthfeel medium carbonation  drink very well rounded very enjoyable  conclusion easy to see why this is one of the top american imperial stouts was a very enjoyable experience would not hesitate to pick up more if it presented itself
4439,Nelson,4,12oz can date stamp on bottom reads bieb 82323 cloudy straw colored body one finger of white head which quickly dissipates to an interrupted head and ring leaves behind some minor webs of lacing aroma of berry and citrus orange with some tropical and floral hops taste is dry with flavors of citrus tropical and floral rye at the end low bitterness and a balancing sweetness medium mouth feel crispiness in the mouth good carbonation tasty and totally quaffable
4440,Nelson,4.16,so what do we have here a once legendary beer that has allegedly been bastardized beyond recognition this was a long time want for me before i knew the whole story of it and ultimately ended up forgetting about it however when i saw it on tavour i figured it was at least worth a shot lets crack it open and see if its really as bad as some say  pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing  the nose is quite vibrant here im not really understanding the complaints yet im picking up on aromas of red grapefruit gooseberry grassy hops rye bread white pepper orange zest light papaya and white grape  its a bit less balanced in taste for sure focusing more on the bitterness but its still damn good on the front end of the sip im tasting gooseberry earthy hops lemon zest rye bread grass overripe cantaloupe and light weed the swallow brings notes of rye bread earthy hops black pepper lemon zest papaya pithy grapefruit light papaya and dank weed  a light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a snappy beer finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness to keep things refreshing  maybe drinking this through the lens of not having had the original invalidates my opinion but i dont really care this isnt perfect but a damn good ipa as is
4441,Nelson,3.79,i first rated alpines nelson in 2015 and gave it a 441 average rating its been the third highest of all the ipas ive rated over the years not quite 200  in those early years 20142015 i had nelson on tap a few times it was uncommon in seattle but always a treat  well now ive had nelson in cans and i guess its the new nelson ive read about some of the behind the scenes stuff on whos made it i dont know the whole story but i do know that the beer i just had in a six pack is nothing too special its nowhere near what i remember of the once ethereal beer so i deleted my old rating as it no longer applies this is a new ratingreview as of july 2023  nelson looks gorgeous big fluffy white head and golden color the smell is piney its a little out of the ordinary for a 2023 beer as its not a citrus bomb grapefruit like pliny and its also a long way from the fruity hazy taste profiles of ne ipas its kind of old school which i like however the rye character has pretty much gone missing and the nelson sauvin hop profile isnt nearly as good as i remembered fortunately its still got a solid bitterness to it  i guess im just pining for the og
4442,Nelson,4.23,found this on friday while returning from some hiking and stopped at total wine on the way back to the old line state this is obviously a beer that needs no introduction and i wasnt sure if it was available on the east coast opaque ultra yellow body like a latter day hazy ipa but the nose is more familiar citrus and grapefruit lending towards pine but still fruity  the flavor is unique very dry at the outset it seems pretty subtle but continues to develop and deliver throughout the aftertaste high carbonation also hides flavor in the early stages before revealing grapeskin bread bubble gum melon and finally the promised rye really nice luxurious mouthfeel is a highlight as well i did not love the start but this one grew on me
4443,Nelson,4.4,2x12oz cans poured into a large dimpled stein while i smoke some salmon and relax on a cool saturday evening can says its best by today l hazy yellowtangerine colored body frothy eggshell head holds great retention s juicy citrus pineapple stone fruit wheat perhaps faint spicy rye t rye is more prominent in flavor adding some spiciness and robustness juicy pineapple tangerine mango and nectarine with bitter pine on the finish f fuller body ample carbonation bittersweet finish with pine and citrus zest lingering with the spicy rye very dry finish o i love a rye ipa ive never had one like this  world class beer here
4444,Nelson,4.3,a classic that i understand has changed throughout the years sampled on tap hazy orange with notes of citrus white grape lemon bubblegum bread crust and weed on both the nose and taste low to medium bitterness with a medium mouthfeel and carb a textbook wellexecuted nelson profile white grape aftertaste very good each category is pushing 45 for me so i give this a 45 overall
4445,Nelson,3.75,pours a very hazy orangeyellow with a one finger head aroma is oranges and to a small extent lemons taste is clean and very orangey this is a clean no frills ipa and that is also its strength  it does one thing and one thing well
4446,Nelson,4.75,pours orange hue with a thick head smells of citrus orange peel taste of citrus hits immediately with orange and light pineapple medium bodied and smooth one of the best ipas ive had worth it
4447,Nelson,4.2,my goto ipa pours with a bright orange with a thick white head smells of orange peel taste of mixed citrus and sweet fruits pineapple orange with a mild bitter finish a little fizzy with a medium body

4449,Nelson,4.29,pours a cloudy yet bright sun yellow with a thick longlasting white head nice lacing aroma is tropical fruit flavor follows the nose sweet oranges and melon in front with a mild hop bitterness in the finish feel is medium bodied and adequately carbonated overall a very nice beer
4450,Nelson,4.39,this is a genuinely good india pale ale but it may not be for everyone first of all its hazy but its not an neipa secondly its dry and bitter which many of us love but if youre looking for a wellbalanced beer in terms of hops vs malts this is not for you  nelson is bitter and i think its made with rye which accentuates hops but its also not hard to drink and is quite zesty in terms of hops meaning its less piney and more fruit forward citrus but with layers of character and thats cool because this is a single hop ipa obviously as the name implies i like this beer a lot its usually expensive it may not be canned by alpine blah blah blahits great and if you like ipas its a musttry beer
4451,Nelson,4.04,can with unreadable date gl tulip  a pours a turbid hazy yellow with three fingers of meringuelike frothy white head no visible carbonation its too hazy  s from a foot away i can smell the sweet tropical fruitiness like papaya and gooseberries in syrup  t on first arrival hop burn tangy tart tropical citric floral ending on a grapefruit rind light bitterness there is a lingering bitterness that i actually find unpleasant i think its the rye i love rye whiskey but i cant think of a single rye beer ive liked  including this one the hop burn and sweetness on the arrival make it unpleasant as does the weird rye finish  m lighter side of medium pillowsoft  o i saw this on the shelf ten years ago and wanted to buy it but passed it up i didnt start seeing it here again until a year ago and thats post ab acquisition i wasnt willing to get a six but i saw a single today and wasnt going to miss it again when this beer came out ten years ago it was revolutionary not so much today its beautiful to look at and smell and is still a great example of the hazy ipa style but strikes me as too fruity and unpleasant on the finish at least its got a good name
4452,Curieux,4.25,12oz bottle thanks to ken for the bottle l sightly hazed golden body foamy creamy white head s doughy grain floral noble hops spicy yeast mild oaky bourbon t dough pale malt oak bourbon vanilla light caramel honey spicy belgian yeast grassyspicyfloral noble hops f super smooth medium body alcohol is warming pleasant carbonation balanced  dry finish o i wasnt wowed by this the first time i had it but it truly lives up to its reputation
4453,Curieux,4.78,from a can purchased at the brewery first time and wow so good flowery but not perfumy light and bright on the palette like other allegash beers complex nuanced a real journey not overly boozy in spite of the high abv not an everyday beer a special event
4454,Curieux,4.1,very deceptive very tasty  when i see a brew is barrelaged at 105 and it has a taste that hints of the booze  i found it very deceptive in a good way the booze that i expected to taste and even smell  was basically nonexistent i find this to be well made for that fact alone a tasty treat indeed that i would be glad to try once again
4455,Curieux,4.34,poured from a can into a tulip glass appearance  the beer pours a clear golden color with a small white foam the head has a fantastic level of retention fading slowly over time and leaving tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass smell  the aroma is big and bold with lots of candied sugar and biscuit malt mixed with these aromas comes a nice doughy smell mixed with lots of coriander and clove along with a bit of nutmeg at the same time notes of yeast and some peach and lychee are there as well for a bourbon barrel aged brew the bourbon smell is light but adds a nice accent mixing with the rest to produce a rather inviting smell taste  the taste begins with a nice crisp cracker and biscuit malt flavor mixed with some sweet grape peach and apricot flavors as well as flavors of candied sugar and yeast cake along with these flavors comes a decent showing of coriander and clove with some lighter notes of white pepper and grain as the taste advances the sweeter flavors get stronger with some bubblegum and cane sugar joining in at the same time a bit of grass and hay join in and with a touch of bourbon coming on at the end one is left with a nice sweet crisp and flavorful triple like flavor to linger on the tongue mouthfeel  the body of the brew is light for a 105  abv brew with a carbonation level that is high and effervescent for the style and the taste the feel is great and makes for a very pleasant sipper overall  while not very heavy on the bourbon at all the brew is rather flavorful and tasty a very nice slightly sweeter sipper and one certainly worth a try
4456,Curieux,3.84,interesting idea to barrel age a tripel and the barrel notes are quite nice however i find the overall flavor profile lacks many of the qualities im looking for from a solid belgian tripel in addition to being a bit too boozy for the style
4457,Curieux,4.5,pours a gorgeous slightly unfiltered golden color with a creamy white head that yields to the body of the beer fairly quickly beautiful tripel the nose is crammed full of oak notes with caramel and vanilla in plentiful amounts and a bit of bourbon and pear i am literally drooling  that oak flavor is forward and melds well with the caramel and vanilla to provide a smooth foundation for the bourbon to provide a modest amount of booziness but its the pear at the back of the palate that is knocking my beer nerd socks off so many flavors and so well balanced  the mouthfeel is substantial and fairly crisp making for an oxymoron of a beer  a crushable 102 abv beer this is exceptionally well crafted and a world class tripel that i am so glad i finally had the opportunity to enjoy
4458,Curieux,4.5,lovely beer citrusy spicey taste scotch and lemon peel very fresh for a tripel
4459,Curieux,4.25,looks like a lager but dont be fooled the nose has a noted alcohol hit and the flavor is just a touch of classic belgian maltiness with an big dose of bourbon like someone had dumped a shot in the pint a nonfunky but still distinctive beer id recommend trying
4460,Curieux,4.25,this one has been on my list to try for a while its a tripel aged in barrels which i guess converts it to a belgian pale ale pours paler than expected fizzy and quick dissipating foam smells of cloves and typical belgian smells but then you get the whiff of the whiskey barrel its like drinking earlytimes on the rocks after all the ice has melted and thats actually excellent the barrel is pretty prominent especially in such a pale beer you also get notes of vanilla and toffee this is definitely a unique beer and glad i got to try it label is okay a bit boring and generic but also dignified its fine
4461,Curieux,4.25,a tavour treat pours a golden color with a minimal head that lasts quite a while aroma of grains and citrus fruit taste is sour with a hint of apples and an alcohol bite very good brew
4462,Labatt Ice,3.51,its not a bad beer by any means but fairly cheap looking tasting and smelling the feeling is smooth and vibrant saving it from falling below average
4463,Labatt Ice,3.45,l standard straw yellow lager color head looks okay but fades away quick s hard to really smell much malt a bit of alcohol and the usual corn adjuncts t possibly the most well rounded of the macro ice beers corn grassy hops you can taste a bit of alcohol and the sweetness but not offensive you get a hint of the sour aftertaste like milwaukees best ice etc but much less strong it has a bit of that soy sauce taste you get in stronger beers which i like not overwhelmed by corn sweetness or sour aftertaste f less carbonated than some ice beers very refreshing and easy to drink overall definitely one of the best for the category a very solid goto for cheap beer enthusiasts
4464,Labatt Ice,2.58,american brewed faint lacing 1 finger rapidly fading head taste of adjunct beer with a splash at the finish of vodka not very good priced accordingly this is one whole dollar cheaper than a weaker imported labatt bleue single
4465,Labatt Ice,2.46,the local beer store has been really good about single purchases of their beers and this was another that i picked up poured into a clear glass and the color was a light golden with a small white head the smell was beerlike nothing really special taste was okay and not as good as i expected would i drink it again sure but i cant say that i would seek it out
4466,Labatt Ice,2.5,24oz can poured out a clear strawyellow color with a small fizzy white head of bubbly foam it left no lacing at all it smelled of caramel grains corn and some grassy notes sweet caramel and grain taste with a bitter bite crisp and sharp
4467,Labatt Ice,2.2,purchased as a single bottle from the nearest citgo for 199 poured into a nonic pint glass  l  clear gold with a minimal pale white head s  corn flakes biscuit and grass t  follows nose exactly finish is very clean f  lightbodied wellcarbonated super drinkable refreshing o  its a cheap macro with simple flavors and barely a smell however this is one of the more palatable ones id put this onpar with natty ice or bud ice but there are definitely better macros for the price point that fit the vibe of this one probably wont buy again but its not too bad
4468,Labatt Ice,3.15,embarking on an adjunct adventure lately seeing if i can find a commercial macro that competes with or bests pbr for my taste buds this one is pretty decent  no offensive smells or flavors a lightbodied easydrinking bready malt but not as good as labatt blue allaround
4469,Labatt Ice,3.36,24oz can stamped b19127 poured into a becher glass at fridge temp 56 abv the beer pours bright light golden in color with off white head the head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles minimal lacing the aroma is faint with vague corny and grainy notes the taste is semisweet corn plus stewed mixed vegetables and vegetable oil minimal bitterness and a hint of tart the mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and somewhat dry finish overall not great but it appears to be over two years old from the stamp id drink again in the right setting with a fresher sample
4470,Labatt Ice,3.36,it is a canadian adjunct lager that you can only get in canada if you are in america you will only be able to get the brewed in america water grain and freeze method this is watching hockey or football beer this is a summer and it is a hot day or oktoberfest is over or your hockey team made it to the playoffs not sure why it is only getting a 65 but i liked it it is smooth drinkable and has taste notes of adjuncts the maple leaf on the front fools americans into buying a 30 pack for dirt cheap calling it canadian and even making a joke about the metric system saying eh or cracks about geese moose and maple syrup
4471,Labatt Ice,2.67,not better than normal labatt blue dont believe the reviews the smell is strange
4472,Labatt Ice,3.4,okay so as the first ice brewed beer ever made i have to give it props  that being said i put this in the freezer but the alcohol content isnt nearly enough to keep it from completely freezing i dont understand the purpose of an ice beer if it cant be served ice cold  anyway it is reasonably priced  the flavor is pretty standard for an ice beer better tasting than milwaukees best ice  im not really a fan of ice brewed beer especially keystone ice but this one is tolerable for what its worth  its nothing to write home about just an ice brewed beer or how they say in the frenchy part of canada bi√®re
4473,Labatt Ice,3.67,ok so ice beer look strong amber appearance smell mellow slight red wine smell as well as aftertaste almost has a mouth feel of a dry red wine taste compared to a lot of other iced beers does not have a strong alcohol after taste mouth feel is average above average
4474,Citra,4.6,the first citra was incredible we found that bottle aging for ten days smoothed it out after a few years of substandard citra hops resulting in a brew not as good as the first its back up to where it was in the beginning since krbc switched to all aluminum cans the mouth feel is less wonderful than from a bottle its best at the brewery the food i go to drink not to eat the waffle fries are flavored soggy cardboard
4475,Citra,4.04,great flavored ipa full of hoppy flavor in every sip great hop after taste great beer to drink again

4477,Citra,4.58,the smell is just unreal and this one is not for a first time ipa drinker what a treat and i hope they continue to expand with their distribution very lucky to get a hold of this legendary beer so many powerful tasting notes and the sweetness at the end is done just right
4478,Citra,4.72,pours golden yellow with thin white foamy cap in small tulip glass on draught at fathers office beautiful citrus pineapple mango and hops on the nose really great springy dipa bursting with citra hops cheers to greatness
4479,Citra,4.51,citra pours a slightly hazy cloudy amber color with a big beautiful head a sixteen ounce canned 112422 is very strong with the citra aroma taste is powerful and good citra and amarillo go together well in this brew fabulously smooth and not really bitter at all overall a fine double ipa
4480,Citra,4.35,both 2beerdogs and beersnake1 sent me cans of this one related to the recent nbs bif16 so i guess the california contingent feels strongly that i should try it  beautiful clear caramel gold colour with a good finger plus of just off white foam soft and velvety with sprinkled large bubbles it sticks to the glass as it recedes  nose is a great showcase for citra hops and that works for me because citra is a great hop theres some citrus some pine some kind of light honeysuckle and wonderful rich complementary caramel malts underneath  flavour isnt quite as rich as the aroma but it presents all the goodies bitter citrus and pine some caramel malts some round fruits finish is bitter but not overpowering by any means its mostly in the pithcitrus side of things but not the full on acid bomb of like a monkish and its balanced with a little bit of earthy pine and a touch of the sweet malts to balance  this is just a phenomenal beer all around and right up my alley i love what ive tried from kern river and i can see why both tim and derek both independently thought i should try this beer thanks fellas
4481,Citra,4.35,poured from a can at fridge temp pours an opaque yellow with fluffy white head the nose is tropical fruit pine needles marmalade the taste is incredible tropical fruit orange peel pine honey marmalade apricot pineapple and a bit of leather mouthfeel is light and dry overall a wonderful ipa
4482,Citra,4.35,16 ounce can into plastic hotel room cup at tustin inn canned on 31722 pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention that reduces to a thin cap that lasts dense soapy lacing clings down the glass with some streaming carbonation aromas and flavors of huge passion fruit papaya mango melon guava blueberry tangerine red grapefruit citrus peelrind wood mint peppercorn pine cracker bread dough light honeytoast herbal floral grass and yeast earthiness good sized pine citrus peelrind herbal woody grassy spicy bitterness on the finish medium carbonation and mediumfull body balanced creamygrainy malts and stickyresinous hops in the mouthfeel long resinous drying finish with mild astringency mild increasing warmth of 85 a bit of hop burn super juicy dank and earthy hops with a good sized malt backbone top tier west coast style aggressive yet smooth
4483,Citra,4.94,poured a golden amber color with a nice 1 inch head that left some lacing taste is exactly what i hoped forloads of delicious dank citra mouthfeel is nice has some rich gravity to it im highly considering buying some more of thisvery nice delicious brew very strong on the citra hops and leans on the west coast ipa side thankfully
4484,Pranqster,4.61,pours clear and light golden with very nice head and light lacing absolutely awesome flowery and citrus like aromas which are very strong sweet and light sour notes but overall extremely pleasant almost like rose water and possibly honey its a very unique taste in beer medium thinkness in the mouth and very easy drinking  overall a really wonderful beer
4485,Pranqster,4.71,what a great surprise this beer turned out to be i love belgian triples and wanted something lower on the abv scale that had an easy drinkability quality to it this one is great this is right up there with brugge zot for an easy going beer in the summer
4486,Pranqster,5,i have tried this beer out of a bottle at the same one on the picture before the really light had a nice sweet citrusy aroma and the flavor was kind of like a belgian triple also sweet with a citrusy flavor finish
4487,Pranqster,4.17,very solid blue has the usual belgian  farmhouse funk but is also very drinkable and smooth at the same time this is a great beer to get into belgian beers
4488,Pranqster,4.14,appearance cloudy deep gold body average size white head modest lacing aroma soft orchard fruit earthy yeastiness slightly sweet maltiness taste floral spicy fruity hop footprint malts and yeast add depth and intensity mouthfeel mediumtofull bodied with good carbonation overall totally enjoyable
4489,Pranqster,4.1,poured from a twelve ounce bottle a fast fading initial head and modest lacing the body pours a cloudy blond color  taste and nose are super fruity with a delightful honey flavor and some banana yeast and bread notes are secondary but present on the sweet side but not cloying no sign of abv  good mouthfeel and carbonation this beer is smooth drinking not as dry complex or strong as duvel but an enjoyable beer
4490,Pranqster,4.51,excellent blonde a little too thin on finish
4491,Pranqster,3.77,for craft domestic its fantastic has belgian overtones no question but is very slightly thin vs a real belgian strong ale at this price will put some thought into next purchase of 4 pack
4492,Pranqster,3.99,pours a cloudy golden color with a small head and light lacing  smells of bread yeast and bananas  tastes of bread yeast cloves and apples with a wheat tanginess  medium light body with light carbonation light clean mouthfeel  this is a very drinkable american brew that is true to the belgian style
4493,Pranqster,4.13,pours a pale golden color with a half a finger pillowy head  smells very bready hoppy and very wheaty  goes down smooth yeast and wheat dominate the flavor medium carbonated leaves minimal lacing reminds me of a good festbier
4494,Pranqster,3.61,appearance pours a cloudy golden color with an offwhite foam head that lacks retention  aroma belgian esters apple cider dark fruits honey and biscuit  taste sweet honey and candy up front then fades into dark fruit notable bready yeasty undertones throughout  overall not my favorite beer style but is a good experience when looking to explore this one has a little complexity to it
4495,Lager,3.83,pours dark amber gold medium carbonation and a decent foamy head dark and earthy aromas with sweet notes initial malt and toffee taste washed down with slight hoppy aftertaste smooth and crisp feel nice example of how you can change up a lager
4496,Lager,4.54,a really good easy drinking amber flavorful but crisp its what a boston lager tastes like when its a good batch but that seems rare these days if i closed my eyes and drank this i wouldnt know it was a lager caramel malts toffee and a middle bitterness to it balanced between sweet and dry i really like this
4497,Lager,4.43,l dark amber in colour some lacing s candied fruits malts herbs bread t citrus zest herbs cake f fullbodied balanced carbonation  o 45
4498,Lager,3.77,very malty as the label states and almost smoky in taste poured from a 6 month old can into a pint glass it had a decent head and aroma i would call this more of a vienna lager than an american lager it feels well crafted and it was enjoyable but not outstanding to drink
4499,Lager,4.55,ahh the best american lager that l ever had this is my go to lager the aroma malty hoppy toasty bread toffee the taste same as above very smooth easy drinking 52 abv makes it a good session beer very nice to look at with a white one finger head and nice lacing you can see the quality the carbonation hangs around  the finish gives you that light punch of hops at the end this beer is a hidden gem
4500,Lager,3.75,375  low carbonation bitter for a lager drinkable
4501,Lager,4.04,very respectable lager many have compared this to sam adams and i think thats accurate good frothy head although not rising too much hop character is perfect for my taste producing a clean bitterness without overwhelming the malt smooth finish very easy drinking
4502,Lager,3.5,12oz bottle light amber body small foamy head malty aroma toasty taste is lightly toasted malts with a nice hoppy kick at the finish simple bt todays standards but a trend setter in its time
4503,Lager,3.54,color reddishbrown like a slightly pale copper smell hops are the main scent that jumps out taste very hoppy with a slightly sweet finish very lightly floral feel medium carbonation medium weight to it it feels crisp and fresh
4504,Molson Canadian Light,1.02,wasnt even going to write a review on this until i was a few sips in just wait anyway three tall boys of this swill was gifted to me by an uncle who won some in store credit to the tune of around 500 on some truck stop game machines thanks man  look  transparent yellow without a head and an assload of carbonation no stick  smell  heres where things really get fun absolutely astringent in every sense of the word all reference to beer was filtered from this thing and replaced with leftover industrial cleanser  taste  if youve read the scent you already understand the taste bitter as all get out to boot  feel  heavily carbonated like champagne on steroids and far too thick bodied for its own good swallow induces the gag reflex and nearly makes you spit up the beer  overall  absolutely atrocious in every sense of the word figured this was going to be another generic light lager without a frill that scored in the mid 2s and forgotten by tomorrow morning instead i will remember this for all the wrong reasons a light lagerhell any adjunct lager style is supposed to be easy going and poundable without a care in the world this thing fails in every single regard aside from maybe the appearance up there with steel reserve and labatt maximum ice in terms of worst tasting beers ive ever had the displeasure of consuming any other light lager you can grab at a supermarket is like a tipa compared to this seriously even something as putrid as natural ice tastes like heaven compared to this  edit as of 22018 tried to drink another one absolutely terrible sweaty and chokingly bubbly guess the rest go to my neighbor
4505,Molson Canadian Light,2,not good at all has a strange taste up front then a strange aftertaste
4506,Molson Canadian Light,2.75,molson canadian light lager 4  clear pale yellow gold color with a frothy white cap of foam thin light lager aroma and taste with mild corn and grains thin but refreshing cheers
4507,Molson Canadian Light,2.25,apours a straw color with a slight head and lacing aaroma has slight grain hints tthe taste follows the nose with a slight grain flavor ma light bodied decently carbonated beer oa mediocre lager
4508,Frio Light,2.12,12 oz can poured into imperial pint class look light straw color no head development no lacing minimum carbonation smell malty nothing else taste slight sourness not much malt feels kinda metallic expected watered down flavor feel no much mouthfeel about a halfsecond of bubble alcoholic finish overall nothing stands out about this beer other than the 75 cents i paid in the discount shelf will not get again pair with well i would suggest foods for a light lager but since i dont want to drink this i would not pair food with it
4509,Frio Light,2.03,pours piss pale yellow with a decent twofinger white head that fades from the glass quickly smells of hay barn corn funk faint sweet grain maltiness taste is mainly corn not a lot of flavor going on since it is a light lager lightbodied high carbonation smooth crisp  oh so crushable if your goal is getting tossed on the frio river drinking copious amounts of light lager  forgetting where you are then this beer is most certainly on your menu
4510,Frio Light,1.4,looks slightly darker gold than i expected not that its dark or anything close to it theres an unpleasant aroma like wet cardboard and rotten wood the taste is not much better i cant really say its any worse than the uber popular mu it has this weird grape koolaide flavor that is not something i want in a beer it tastes like mineral water and cardboard theres no distinct hop or malt profile i can detect that being said im not planning on drinking them by themselves i use cheap beers like this to mix micheladas with its actually pretty good for that purpose otherwise its undrinkable
4511,Frio Light,2.65,poured from a can into a pint glass appearance the beer pours a straw color with a small white head that fades very fast to leave almost no lace on the sides of the glass smell  the aroma is of a off corny and cardboard smell mixed a little bit of light cracker smell tastethe taste begins with a off light cracker malt and a bit of a cardboard taste that gets stronger as the taste advances toward the end of the taste an off metallic taste and some hay comes to the tongue and leaves one with a off taste to linger on the tongue mouthfeel the body of the brew is light and the feel is very light for the style the feel is good and makes for a quick sipper overall  ahh not too special here
4512,Frio Light,2.95,ive been famialir with this brew since it s inception being carried e at our local heb stores here in so cntrl tx  when frio light first hit the shelves here i bought a six pack of 16oz of it and it was amazingit tasted like a poor mans belgain triple not too long after that i bought another 6 pack and it was flat out putrid and undrinkable they seem to have stabilized the quality control of int to where it is generally a disagreeable pretty poor swillthat said i really am of the firm opinion that qc  or more precisely the lack of qcis integral how this beer may present at any given point in timei mean with the more expensive american adjunct lagers you get precise consistent product case in point i just bought a 30 pack of this frio light and it presented as a interesting aal akin to a pabst or maybe the dregs of the barrels of some very good beer all that said i think  and i am of the opinion that when the beer travels all the way from where it is brewed in memphis tennessee by quality brewers thats what the can says despite being said in the headliner of review page it is made in wisconsin by  city brewing in hot truck broiling hot actually in the summer it can and will ruin the beer maybe thas why the stuff i just bought here in december tastes pretty good in fact i rate it a solid 3 right now
4513,Frio Light,2.77,so this is a good cheap beer running about 20 for a 30 in texas tastes very similar the coors light and is a good going to a party budget buy i have converted many to drinking this as their daily buy and they have a 60 option thats a little stronger but still good all around a good beer for those that dont want to spend 10 a bottle for micro brew
4514,Frio Light,1.54,appearance pours to thin head that laces a bit pale clear straw color  aroma smells of sweet syrup candy corn overripe pears and apples and a hint of solvent very cheap smelling  flavor flavor is just plain off candylike and not very much like a real beer almost like a nonalcoholic brew except you can detect the alcohol through the thin veil tastes of chemicals aftertaste liuke cheap waxy candy or artificial sweetner yuck  mouthfeel light and bubbly moderate co2 about 25 volumes no astringency watery but quenching  overall tastes weird not enjoyable even at the rock bottom low price point it is pointless
4515,Frio Light,2.81,poured into a nonic pint glass  looks like a classic cartoonish beer with huge white sudsy head and clear golden body smells like damp corn husk cardboard tastes fairly neutral with a little bit of corn adjunct and slight metallicism mouthfeel is light and fluid  overall not spitout bad just plain and watery but not in a good way if i want plain and watery in a good way ill drink natty light
4516,Frio Light,3.08,i received this can from my local inperson trader tone77 who always come through with unexpected and surprising additions for the canquest tm this is just one more excanple of his ability to suss out new canned beers  from the can american brewed 92 calories28 carbs premium pilsner brewed and canned by quality brewers memphis tn  i got some foaming through the vent when i initially cracked it open so i quickly canmenced a glug into the awaiting glass unbidden it formed just under three fingers of foamy fizzy rocky bonewhite head with very limited retention quickly falling to wisps  leaving only a trace of lacing behind color was strawyellow srm   2  4 with nequality clarity nose had an odd maltiness not of an adjunct like corn but instead almost like wheat slightly honeyed hmm i have smelled much worse infrom the style remember to review to style not to taste mouthfeel was thin  watery about par for the course the taste was really bland barely registering as anything more than fizzy water the sites style guidelines read the hop character is low and should only balance with no signs of flavor or aroma agreed it was pretty close to flavorless but the smell was at least noticeable it would be hard to rate it as poor in that case finish was quite dry  refreshing but it was a decent beer in a crappy style i suppose that it would be nice on a hot humid summers day but then again so would a glass of water ymmv
4517,Frio Light,1.38,poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass the appearance is a crystal clear pale light yellow with an almost nonexistent head the aroma is basically tap water the taste mirros the nose it doesnt taste bad but it doesnt taste like a regular beer more like a flavored water or near beer
4518,Frio Light,1.2,imagine pouring 6 ounces of miller lite into a glass with 6 ounces of water and you have frio light
4519,Frio Light,2.39,poured from a 12 oz can has a pale yellow color with a 12 inch head smell is very light hints of corn taste is nowhere to be found maybe the lightest grains not much beer flavor at all feels light in the mouth and overall it just doesnt feel like i drank a beer
4520,Frio Light,1.2,worst beer in the world
4521,Milwaukee's Best Light,3.78,pours a 2 pillowy white head with plenty of lacing color is pale straw with plenty of streaming carbonation aroma very mild grains mouthfeel crisp with a dry finish flavor pleasant grains and a surprising hop presence for the style overall very pleased with this bargain basement light beer at less than 060 a serving its hard to beat
4522,Milwaukee's Best Light,1.9,gold clear loose white head no retention smells like mineral water no malt or hops present the initial flavor is ok halfway through before you swallow theres a stale popcorn flavor that lingers on your palate theres better budget beers out there not for me
4523,Milwaukee's Best Light,2.07,out of can it pours a bright crystal clear gold with a fizzy head that dissipates quickly lazy bubbles run up my glass edge telling the tale of its minimal carbonation mouthfeel smells a little grainy a tiny bit malty tastes follows the nose fairly well i was expecting this beer to be on the fizzy side and double checked the date on the can and was as fresh as can be just seemed kind of flat compared to say miller lite i think i like this more than that despite that difference
4524,Milwaukee's Best Light,3.38,16oz can stamped dec0522 32 poured into a pilsner glass at fridge temp 41 abv the beer pours extremely bright very pale gold with nearly white head the head recedes to an uneven ring and leaves a web of lacing the aroma is on the strong side for the style with stale grain and corn syrup the taste is very light with a hint of corny malt vegetable oil and a slightly bitter finish the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a semi dry finish overall mediocre light aal better in the looks and drinkability categories than taste could definitely use a few more days in the tank to clean up
4525,Milwaukee's Best Light,4.25,looks like a beer smells like a beer taste like a beer feels like a beer and overall id say its a pretty darn good beer for after mowing the yard on a hot day like i just did and the price is pretty darn good for a sixpack of 16oz dont need no fufu beer just a real cold real beer bottoms up
4526,Milwaukee's Best Light,1,drainpour
4527,Milwaukee's Best Light,2.44,look of golden straw smell very fine stale open can from the night before smell tastes faintly stale not undrinkable just somewhat off feels great it is not overly carbonated feels light in iowa and illinois is 1213 a 30 pack extremely cheap it is a great party supply beer in the same vein keystone light is the same if not a little cheaper beer that is a far superior beer all things considered i can see why some people get used to it cause the cost and beer flavor but i cannot get past the stale after taste
4528,Milwaukee's Best Light,5,overallits a really good cheap beer
4529,Milwaukee's Best Light,1.87,not good drink if theres literally nothing else better than mikes hard lemonade  it is smooth though
4530,Cobra,2.84,bottle at punjab london england  a the beer is clear yellow in color and has a light to moderate amount of visible carbonation it poured with a half finger high white head that has good retention properties s light aromas of sweet and pilsener malts are present in the nose along with hints of floral hops t the taste has flavors of pilsener and sweet malts there is a slight amount of bitterness o it feels mediumbodied a bit smooth and very clean on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation o i liked the clean and malty mouthfeel of this beer  serving type bottle
4531,Cobra,2.46,not terrible for a cheap beer to compliment some cheap indian food id take this over a heineken or a corona
4532,Cobra,1.99,de color √°mbar cabeza espumosa media con cuerpo ligero y una carbonataci√≥n mediaalta aroma ligero a malta y granos en boca es ligera dulce con un dejo de malta y un poco de pan
4533,Cobra,2.51,light orange colour no carbonation no foam weak sweet malt smell taste is sweet and watery and strangely reminiscent of apple juice refreshing yet liveless and watery if given the choice between this beer and kingfisher please take the latter please do
4534,Perpetual IPA,4.32,l  golden with some clarity along with an offwhite head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind some lacing s  piney hops along with tropical fruit notes honey and malt  smell is faint t  follows the nose piney bitter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with notes of citrus  orange and grapefruit  with a good amount of malt to balance out any bitterness some honey and caramel as well f  medium bodied with moderate carbonation soft and smooth o  a nicely balanced west coast ipa
4535,Perpetual IPA,4.43,draught very thick and lasting white head bubbling like crazy medium dark gold with a slight orange highlight for the look balanced floral citrus peel and medium toasted and caramelized malt aroma very smooth and balanced floral mixed citrus peel with a good amount of creamy medium toasted malt to provide balance flavor and mouthfeel very good
4536,Perpetual IPA,2.2,im from northern california visiting mother in outside of philly and thought it would be fun to introduce her to ipas vs the leffe belgian abbey and pilsner urquell which shes familiar with i grabbed a 5 varietal 15pack off the state store shelf pa im sorry i did bland would be the description of this ale and that came from my 85year old mother hey im a good son and bought her a 12pack of pilsner urquell so the trip to the state store wasnt a total waste
4537,Perpetual IPA,4.85,our afterwork beersnob party in the horticultural center break room started with this most excellent ipa going on to seven other really good ipas from all over hard to accurately compare that many different fine tastes in sequence but the perpetual imperial is so incredibly outstanding that its hard to imagine any ipa would taste better for sure i want this brew occupying a steady and always stocked space on my chilled beer shelf
4538,Perpetual IPA,4.29,pours a medium golden with white head some citrus on the nose sticky pine sap and citrus all the way this is a classic west coast flavor profile it lingers somewhat but not enough for you to feel underwhelmed on subsequent sips a touch of resin on the finish sticks to your tongue this is a really good ipa
4539,Perpetual IPA,4.77,central pas most iconic beer you could go to a dive bar and theyd most likely have this on tap along with a couple domestics the best wcipa made on the east coast right here
4540,Perpetual IPA,3.75,all the way west coast style dry but hops are very present and delicious dry bread taste if you will malt overtones decent lacing i like
4541,Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.33,latest batch
4542,Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.79,this is one of the best beers on the planet my favorite beer is lou pepe kriek and while of course nothing can replace lpk this is as close as youll find anywhere outside of brussels  in the spirit of ba im tempted to use a bunch of pretentious adjectives to describe its color flavor mouthfeel etc but the truth is you really dont any of that just find it
4543,Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.6,this is an excellent christmas eve beer first it has a great color for christmas and the cherry and warm spice taste is perfect for the holiday  bought the bottle of this during the pandemic when it was made possible to order and pick up this beer pours a beautiful reddish purple color with a nice effervescent white head and excellent initial curtain lacing intense tart cherry smell and taste with warm spice flavors and a nice earthy funk enjoyed it very much  had the latest batch on 6522 from tap at the brewery the latest version lives up to previous detected a bit of rich vanilla as well really a great beer
4544,Montmorency Vs Balaton,3.96,a pours up a murky reddish grape hue with a quickly receding white one finger head s immediate cherries and notes of funk and tannic oak there is something here also that comes off a bit like sugary cereal t surprisingly subdued it is sour but not brutally so and the cherry is certainly there but i got some baking spice what seems like cinnamon in the finish and definite although more subtle funk  there are also some other more subtle notes of dark fruit and oaky tannins m surprisingly full but still bone dry o this is an interesting beer it is much more subtle nuanced and complex than i was expecting it to be full disclosure im not a real kriekcherry sour fan so i bought this on reputation alone and while i dont think my mind has been changed about kriek i do think this beer is more than the sum of its parts and has some nice complexity to offer i think the risk and often the temptation with a flavor as big and assertive as cherry is to let it do all the heavy lifting because it tends to be such a people pleaser on its own fruited sour beer has never been my thing and its still not but i will say that if more these beers handled their subject with the grace and restraint on display here i would be more inclined to buy them
4545,Raging Bitch,2.67,would not buy it again stringent lingering aftertaste that takes all of the fun out belgian  yes ipa  if so i dont know where this beer has no resemblance to a typical ipa think belgian with a ferocious bitter and affronting aftertaste glta i wont go back to this one
4546,Raging Bitch,4,good preseason football beer
4547,Raging Bitch,3.76,look it pours amber with a bit of cloudiness it has an off white head with excellent head retention  smell it has a strong aroma of apricots with caramel with some honey and citrus  taste it has apricot flavor with caramel and honey there are some light cherry elements with other citrus notes in the background there are very light barnyard elements  feel it has a medium full body with moderate bitterness  overall it drinks more link a thick west coast ipa than a belgian to me but there are nice worthwhile flavors
4548,Raging Bitch,3.5,for optimal freshness enjoy by 91422 drank 7222  the yarchives  seethrough golden appearance  a rough pour yielded a big khaki head strong frothy treerung lace  fresh soap mild corn  faint dry wheat notes in the nose  sticky medium mouthfeel  fresh soap  mild orange peel flavors up front dry clove notes and some booze heat on the finish  a bit offputting not so much a melding of styles as a clashing of styles abrasive
4549,Raging Bitch,4.25,poured on tap at dca airport in dc the beer is a clear dark orange color with a frothy offwhite head strong belgian yeast aroma with brown sugar and balancing malt taste is balanced with a slight bitter kick at the end like a belgian funnel throughout lots of brown sugar caramel banana bread spice finishes with a surprising pine not which brings it back to the ipa aspect of things a really fun take on a belgian brew with a lot of similarities but also some surprises recommended
4550,Raspberry Eisbock,4.19,375 ml bottle 2022 vintage purchased cold at the brewery last week poured into tulip glasses  pours a touch cloudy redbrown liquid little foaming raspberry juice dominant with a touch of brown bread on the nose mellow expression of perfumy brandylike booze on the palate notably boozeforward but not quite vinouslike raspberrydominant but never even moderately sweet the fruit and base beer seem to fight for contrast a muddy affair that thankfully opens up and gains more depth over the course the journey through the glass textures lagerlike clean finish body attenuated in part by the hefty strength warmer the flow starts to develop a delicate roundness but the palate is repeatedly stunned by hot flashes of ethanol grateful for finally having tried this while it does offer some interesting sensations its taste leaves much to be desired i would definitely try their other flavored eisbocks regardless 2191
4551,Raspberry Eisbock,3.66,brownish red murky body cream colored head smell has that rustic boozy raspberry aroma leading slight almost toasty yeast and sweet malt supporting taste is raspberry cough syrup with light booze backing the aftertaste is reminiscent of homemade schnapps in the mountains feel is light and smooth but has that booze burn on the finish which is typical for style honestly big sugars add to this burn though i have had better eisbock the fruit here didnt add anything for me if anything the sweetness knocked the balance of the beer further out of kilter
4552,Raspberry Eisbock,4.25,060423 bottle  home
4553,Raspberry Eisbock,3.76,2007 vintage 63oz bottle  138 abv pours a deep claret hue with no head nose expresses an abundance of raspberry surprising given the age as well as a hint cocoa in the background taste consistent with nose however oxidation has definitely set in and there are some vinegar notes at the finish mouthfeel is light in body with a still carbonation overall interesting and still complex despite being past its prime
4554,Raspberry Eisbock,4.47,purchased this one at the brewery and muled it back home in my luggage no abv on the bottle 127oz bottle capped and waxed red wine colored poured into a smallstemmed tulip  i love this beer the oxidation is what struck me at first but the raspberry makes more of an impression as the session continues 45  a  pours a dark amber with a wine impression clear with a very small tannish head that disappears quickly leaving a ring around the glass average lacing and good viscosity on the glass looks like an old ale 45  s  raspberries but not overwhelming some vinous qualities and oxidation like an old ale no noticeable hops 425  t  the abv is slightly noticeable raspberry is faint and much less than perceived in the aroma very winelike no noticeable bitterness faintly sweet which only adds to the taste and the drinkability 45  mf  medium bodied with a semidry finish some very minor astringency and even some citric acid at the end 475
4555,Raspberry Eisbock,4.42,2016 vintage  now this is a beer ive wanted for a long time kuhnhenn doesnt distribute out in mass so im thrilled to finally get my hands on this the highest rated eisbock on ba eisbock is a style id love to find more of in general but one this highly regarded is exciting lets pop it open  pours a muddy brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing  wow the nose on this is incredibly expressive and spirit driven its so complex im picking up on aromas of tart jammy raspberry cherry cordial milk chocolate sweet caramel port wine brown bread raisin nutty malt and sticky molasses  it loses its tart edge in taste and maybe thats a function of its age but it is still complex and tasty on the front end of the sip im tasting jammy raspberry cocoa powder brown sugar sweet wine fig and brown bread the swallow brings notes of cherry cordial cocoa powder port wine sticky molasses jammy raspberry toffee and earthy wood  a medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation resulting in a boozy and slick beer finishes neutral with a little tingle but drinks well below the listed 155  while the taste was lacking a bit this was still a fantastic beer i definitely need to get my hands on a fresh bottle some day it is very close to a liqueur or just a straight up raspberry filled chocolate but the complexity sets it apart
4556,Raspberry Eisbock,4.43,poured from a 375ml bottle into a snifter pours a murky dirty ruby red with a finger of sandy brown foam head raspberries aplenty on the nose a tinge of chocolate malt and even a faint whiff of alcohol burn more raspberries on the taste with a lovely chocolate and malty background not that there is anything wrong with the nose but the flavors are so much more complex than the aromas would lead you to believe really smooth for such a high abv thick full mouthfeel very hard to tell this one is 15 its a sipper for sure and while it carries qualities of old ales and doppelbocks alike it drinks like an 8 fruited stout really interesting style of beer hope to try more of this style
4557,Raspberry Eisbock,4.2,2017 vintage enjoyed on 12162021 low carbonation medium body alcohol extremely well hidden at 15 sweet ripe raspberries front and center with bittersweet dark chocolate undertones
4558,Haze,4.91,look  hazy thick juicy nice foamy white head scattered lacing left behind smell  peach orange tropical citrus taste  peach citrus pith pineapple feel  medium body well carbonated citrus pith bitterness overall  tree house haze all in my brain lately things just dont seem the same the citrus pith bitterness is strong in this one which i love strong citrusy scent right off the bat too tropical juiciness peach and pineapple tantalize the taste buds hoppy finish lingers this brew is excellent and even better when paired with purple haze by jimi hendrix acting funny but i dont know why excuse me while i kiss the sky cheers
4559,Haze,4.48,16oz can into a pint glass canned 421 so 3 weeks old  thick pale orange juice body with a persistent white head leaving rings of lacing muted aroma of tropical fruit which becomes massive in the taste medium hop bite for balance thick mouthfeel outstanding beer
4560,Haze,3.24,ths are in top tier while this one is good i felt the 8 abv almost tasted of a dipa which is too much for my taste us but still good and wouldnt turn down
4561,Labatt Blue Light Lime,4.11,well this is a unique one its apparently beer that is flavored with lime i dont really get the taste of beer coming through  this is like corona that comes with lime already in it except its an interpretation by labatt it has a nice scent to it  the lime flavoring tastes a bit artificial but im guessing they just put the type of lime juice youd find at the store that comes in the green plastic lime bottle intinto it  not the best but not the worst if you like corona with lime you might like this
4562,Labatt Blue Light Lime,2.89,pours very pale yellow with a 2 inch white head moderate lacing  strong aroma of lime smells sweet  taste is lime not much else  light bodied thin and watery very little carbonation dry slightly bitter finish  not bad for a light beer albeit not as good as labatt light grapefruit
4563,Labatt Blue Light Lime,3.77,24 oz can b058 purchased cold poured into a 28 oz mug  l polishedclear pale yellowgold liquid tons of white foam on pour tight cottony pad head fizzles out rather quick not really any lace the lil boogs slip away  s good bit of lime aroma dominating its scent almost smells real really smells more like sprite with a lil cornfed beer mixed in smells alright for what it smells like a shandy  t not gonna lie a relatively delightful flavor at first limeinfused lightlydoughy malt base clean and dry on the outflow though the finish has the faintest color to it like a mix between a lime sweettart candy  lime air freshener humming aftertaste of lime and cereal like trix dry doughy  f very soft suds pillowy texture and flow disappearing finish maybe a delicate touch of residual lime syrup slickness who knows light and easydrinking even when drinking at cellar temp  o tried it just to try it once it wasnt too too dissimilar to a mexican beer with actual limes shoved in the bottle minus real citrus acidity kind of surprising and thankful it didnt taste more glaringly artificial maybe this is what light beers need  flavor infusion  so what 1423
4564,Labatt Blue Light Lime,3.65,24 ounce can into lager glass canned on 6222018 pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a small fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention that reduces to a minimal spotty lace cap that linger light spotty lacing on the with a fair amount of streaming carbonation aromas of lightly tart lime juice citrus peelzest cracker corn white bread and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of limes pale maltgrains and light earthy hop notes with solid strength taste of lightly tart lime juice citrus peelzest cracker corn white bread and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness mild herbal floral grassy zesty bitterness on the finish lingering notes of lightly tart lime juice citrus peelzest cracker corn white bread and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit nice robustness and balance of limes pale maltgrains and light earthy hop flavors with a solid maltbitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish moderately crispclean finishing perfectly clean on lager flavors with no yeasty notes present lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation mediumhigh carbonation and lightmedium body with a very smooth moderately breadygrainy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great zero warming alcohol as expected of 4 overall this is a nice fruited light lager all around nice robustness and balance of limes pale maltgrains and light earthy hop flavors very smooth crisp clean and refreshing to drink very flavorful and not too watery for the abv great balance between vibrant limes and pils maltgrains with solid earthy hop presence for the style not overdone on adjuncts a nicely enjoyable offering and great style example would be great for summer
4565,Labatt Blue Light Lime,5,not bad didnt find the lime flavor overpowering tasted more at the end of each sip than at the beginning refreshing beer for a hot summer day very watery mouthfeel so it goes right down might have it again sometime update  i did have it againcheers
4566,Labatt Blue Light Lime,1.98,well it looks like even canadian brewers are jumping on the fad that is light lagers with lime flavoring i went into this review knowing full well that this wasnt going to be a high quality beer that id be reviewing but a part of me wanted to know how it would stack up against bud light lime and its ilk why who knows but thats just the way my mind works  labatt light lime pours a yellowgold color a fizzy sudsy head less than a pinkys worth forms and thins out in a little under 30 seconds there was quite a collection of fizzy soda bubbles on the side of the glass the aroma was of sweet citrus and lime with some light grain and vegetable smell as mentioned the beer is indeed fizzy and overall feels pretty thin on the palette the light citriclime flavor is the most dominant note here but the beer is still pretty watery even with that lime presence there are some grain and vegetable flavors detectable behind the lime but thats about it the aftertaste is clean and almost non existant except for some nondescript dryness and there is no alcoholic warmth at all in this beer  indeed not a high quality beer at all it is easy to drink but i would say this is more lime than beer save for a summer day thirst quencher when you need something to whet your whistle and nothing more
4567,Labatt Blue Light Lime,1.26,this is up there with the absolute worst beers ive ever had  it pours like youd expect clear and gold with a quickly dissipating head  this smells so unbelievably artificial like syrupy and saccharine lime with corn syrup and skunk  this honestly tastes terrible its revolting with an overly artificial and unpleasant lime flavor just out whatever the base light lager tastes like i get some sweet corn and syrupyness this isnt even all that crisp which is what the style is supposed to be  this is just sad theres no reason at all to drink this
4568,Labatt Blue Light Lime,3.06,labatt blue light lime brewed labatt brewing company ltd with an abv of 400 this brew pours out a nice golden amber color with a smell white head the head to this brew goes away fast this brew has the look of most light lagers on the market not saying that is a bad thing the smell of labatt blue light lime is sweet with lime grains and malts labatt blue light lime smell puts you in the mind set of lemon lime soda now for the taste  it is lime with some beer taste this brew has a nice smooth lime taste to it not much else to say the mouthfeel of labatt blue light lime is light  smooth clean and refreshing this is a nice smooth brew to drink on a hot day there is nothing overpowering about this brew overall im giving labatt blue light lime a 3 out of 5 labatt brewing company ltddid a nice job with this one i would buy this brew again when it get really hot
4569,Pseudo Sue,4.5,yup  worthy of its five star status  every characteristic that can be rated is excellent every beer ive had from these people has been top notch
4570,Pseudo Sue,3.83,a a very dusty orange in cookie with a light white head  s hoppy and grassy with grapefruit tones  t citrus with orange peel and grapefruit standing out lovely  m medium body moderate carbonation b and a creamy feel to it  o overall very enjoyable
4571,Pseudo Sue,4.47,poured from the 16oz can into a pint glass the beer is a bright hazy orange color murky and opaque topped with a 2 finger fizzy offwhite head i am thinking i will need to fight comparisons to king sue but for the appearance it isnt as milky as i would have described the other beer it is a little duller it looks like a very hazy ipa  smell is very strong and refreshing and apparent from some distance away even when just opening the can quite tropical orange and citrus rind grapefruit juice pineapple mango balance upon further inspection in some bready malt within some piney hop in the mix but not as much as advertised or described by other reviewers in my opinion  taste has a bit more of the pine notes but it also more balanced with a more malty character than anticipated biscuit honey it is lacking some of the heat i perceived in king sue but that is a good thing smooth fruit again is tropical with a lot more orange and mango tropical notes throughout but balanced with a dryness finishes with a touch of pine  drinkable accessible this is possibly a gateway beer that i would introduce others to craft with but that being said it is far from bland in many ways this is what i want most hazy ipas to be balanced refreshing tropical flavorful even almost sessionable i wouldnt call it exciting some of the best beers are not but i would call it worldclass for the style does exactly what you want
4572,Pseudo Sue,4.02,purchased online from halftime beverage my second brew from toppling goliath vessel council belgianstyle tulip  p opaque orange with a 1f foamy white head decent retention n med to medbold stone fruit and citrusy notes with lightmed sweetness t follows nose stone fruit citrus and green hops over biscuity malt grapefruit in the aftertaste some citrusy tang in there as well bef the finish subdued sweetness pleasant but not super interestingnotable mf medfull bodied medhigh carb o much like king sue which i tried recently i was expecting to be wowed by this but it fell short of my expectations not a bad hazy pale ale though just not quite getting the world class elements of it  review date 011123 can date 101422
4573,Pseudo Sue,4.5,not as hoppy as most ipas thats my only negative but might be a positive for some nice smooth taste otherwise
4574,Pseudo Sue,3.8,we tasted this beer and we all were pretty much in agreement nice color fast dissolving head and a somewhat pleasant nose citrus or grapefruit came through on the nose but it wasnt overpowering it was clean and crisp on the mouthfeel but average on the flavor tasted like a plain old beer not much bite although it wasnt too dry or bitter on the backside which is a plus i wouldnt call it a good beer just average wwwobbtsorg
4575,Pseudo Sue,4.37,had on draft at summits here in snellville with a price tag of 899 look arrived in a 16 oz glass a thick very hazy dull gold with a white finger all white head that slowly faded aroma hoppy citrus with a dank perhaps pine nut undertone also get some mango orange scent land a scent of bread malts taste seems like more of an ipa hoppy citrus a little bitterness very tasty very drinkable and a real winner medium bodied quite carbonated finishes clean and dry
4576,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,4.15,reminds me of a lower abv version of their the great pumpkin i wish there was more than the token amount of head there is no lacing beautiful clear copper color though pumpkin pie on nose and flavor medium body fine to very fine carbonation in the mouth nice
4577,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,4,this beer has been on the list since i started getting into pumpkin ale more last year i believe pumpkin and malt and hops go together great flavor great pumpkin overall very good i just wish they would have toned down the spices it took me a bit to figure out if it was too much hops or too much spice perhaps this needs to sit for a month because it is super fresh and the spice may mellow out a bit this is still great work cheers
4578,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,3.81,night owl which is funny because who thinks of an owl during the day aint no one going hoo hoo when you are off to get wings at b dubs its like calling a beer night prostitute like boomin betsy does not work the day shift  anyway the beer is pretty good  see ya
4579,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,3.42,bought the elysian pumpkin pack to bring on the holiday spirit early you can taste all the spices in this with a slight after taste of the pumpkin nice seasonal variety right here
4580,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,4.25,cinnamon vanilla cloveginger slight pie crust on smell and taste is gingerspices with slight bitterness from the pumpkin and hops some caramelized sweetness reminiscent of a brown ale easy to get pumpkin beer i get every year around here in oregon
4581,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,3.71,clear copper big dense offwhite head soso retention streaky lace lots of spice on the nose underneath a bit of caramel spice is a bit more subdued on the palate still the main focus some caramel malt just a bit of roast pumpkin mediumheavy bodied appropriate carbonation tastes like a pumpkin beer they pulled it off a bit better than others do but still too spice focused for me
4582,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,5,this beer tastes like the water from a touch tank at the aquarium 1010 love it
4583,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,3.93,poured from a can into a pint glass pours reddish orange with a fluffy white head smells of pumpkin pie inviting tastes of pumpkin pie and cinnamon beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation overall a very good beer
4584,OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.95,12 fl oz bottle thanks to my son steinar abv is 72 cloudy dark brown colour big and creamy tan head very nice aroma of fruity american hops and oak blackcurrants marmelade some vinous notes too the mouthfeel is first soft and creamy and the flavour is first fruity smooth and alluring then a treacherous and distinct hoppy bitterness sets in accompanied by oaky and smoky notes very bitter aftertaste an arrogant beer perhaps  but not quite as arrogant as i feared i am worthy
4585,OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.18,reviewed from notes  pours a reddish brown from the 22 ounce bottle excellent clarity off white foamy head that was generous and lasted for a time before reducing to a nice foamy cap  the smell is not as aggressive as anticipated i get a sweet impression  carameltoffee and sweet dark fruits  raisinfig maybe date theres enough resinous pine to give a promise of a hefty bitterness but there are also softer floral notes an earthiness a very slight citrus zest the malts weigh in with biscuits and toast spicy like cloves  the taste delivers on whats promised by the smell caramel and toffee lead followed by sweet dark fruit this rides on the back of the toast and biscuit flavors then other flavors come along  a woodiness from the oak floral earthy definite citrus zest resembling orange and big but not unpleasant sharp bitterness no sign of the abv whatsoever while it could be jagged everything comes together for a smooth experience  everything lingers into the aftertaste its got a nice sticky feel without being overly cloying carbonation seems medium and appropriate for this beer smooth and creamy oddly the beer feels good  overall this was a smoothdrinking flavor bomb layered and integrated very nicely even with the substantial kick of bitterness well done
4586,Heineken Lager Beer,3.58,poured from bottle into glass  clear bubbly straw color capped with a tight bright white head good retention and lacing  smells skunky cabbage lemon grass cracker malt  tastes skunky lemon cabbage grass dough white pepper grassy finish  bubbly smooth creamy crisp  not a bad lager better on tap or from a can to avoid skunkiness enjoyable though

4592,Heineken Lager Beer,2.93,doest what it says on the tin probably better than most of its corporate brothers can only rate it in relative terms its grand
4593,Heineken Lager Beer,3.75,pours a 3 finger head into kolsch styled glass moderate to high lacing clean flavor with slight malt flavor and tangy hops dry finsh classic lager beer best acquired in enclosed cases or cans
4594,Heineken Lager Beer,3.46,poured from bottle into pint glass look clear yellow standard lager appearance 1 finger of quickly dissipating head smell clean and crisp hints of malt taste refreshing clean classic lager taste feel moderatetohigh carbonation lightbodied overall i remember drinking this beer decades ago when i first turned 21 and i recall and distinct skunky odor and taste which i attributed to the green bottle letting in too much light i am very happy that skunky flavor and aroma is now gone im not sure what the heineken corporation did since they still use the same green bottles and the result is a clean and refreshing lager
4595,Heineken Lager Beer,2.64,i like drinking matching beers to occasions that make sense to me this was my grandfathers favorite beer im drinking it late night on what would have been his one hundredth birthday  22 oz bottle acclimated to 48f and poured into a pilsner glass  pours a clear very slightly pale pale in saturation not in pitch yellow gold with a 1 finger foamy white head  initial aroma is that quintessential lager smell crisp with slight hops somewhat skunky and diluted to my nose after agitating it smells a little cleaner overall a deal has been struck to quench thirst and fulfill expectation not to excel in any field  initial taste before swallowing is a little skunky and hoppy after swallowing i get a minor amount of hops and bitterness sweetness like that in cheap white bread and maltiness akin to malt vinegar its a little dry overall this is a lager that exists  mouthfeel is fine smoother than some ive had but it honestly doesnt do anything special  i may buy heineken again likely not as stated in the beginning i purchased it because it was my grandfathers favorite and im drinking it to honor his 100th birthday maybe as a once a year occasion for his birthday its one of those that you need to be in the right headspace for i met it head on knowing full well it would not exceed expectations but that does not excuse its lackluster performance as far as raw numbers go sorry grampy i know you loved it
4596,Anchor Porter,4.06,poured from 12ounce bottle into a willi becher glass appearance leaves nothing to be desired colacolored body with ruby highlights a thick longlasting light tan head good retention and lacing for my money this reaches its peak at near room temperature roasty and a little bitter with notes of caramel chocolate toffee and dark fruit coming to the fore mediumlight in body with a bit of astringence and a sour note lingering on the finish overall an outstanding beer hopefully anchor will find some way to carry on
4597,Anchor Porter,4.12,bottled on 03282023 enjoyed on 7302023 this my second bottle i had the first on on 7282023 for some reason this bottle is better and has more robust flavor impressive head with a aggressive pour leaves plenty of lacing flavor is roast chocolate caramel and a hint of dark fruit plus a micro hint of coffee rather smooth and slightly bitter overall a solid beer kinda old school
4598,Anchor Porter,4,bottled on 060922  a  pitch black pour with a frothy layer of creamy foam resting on top  s  nice roasty chocolate and coffee malt aroma with a touch of char  t  chocolate roast a slight bit of coffee some toffee and a hint of dark fruit finishes with a pleasing lingering chocolate coffee char theres also a very slight bit of astringency  m  medium body with soft prickly carbonation  o  solid and glad to finally find this one first time ever noticing it on the shelf

4602,Anchor Porter,4.72,poured from a bottle into a tulip glass the body is inky black with a half inch of brown head with a mild pour retention is average the intensity of aroma is medium there are notes of malt salted toffee rich dark chocolate and black coffee it smells wonderful the intensity of taste is medium high with a dryer and more hoppy flavor than the aroma suggests normally i loath hoppy porters but anchor got this one right with a swallow the flavor keeps going there are flavors of toffee deep dark chocolate more black coffee than in the aroma and a long pronounced hoppy flavor thats medium in intensity its rich and delicious ive missed having a go to dark beer after new castle changed this will likely be its much better replacement i usually support local austin breweries but this is a much better beer than 512 pecan porter which is much more expensive for a fourpack compared to a sixpack of this the thickness is just under medium its quite dry with a low level of astringency well i finished the bottle before i could accurately detect the level of creaminess with its 56 abv im feeling a little numbness in my face i will open another bottle tomorrow to finish this the level of creaminess is high the carbonation is unique the bubbles are tiny and tickle the tongue creating a effervescent quality it has a lot of world class qualities in the mouth feel alone overall im amazed by how excellent this is after trying a few beers that i didnt care for anchor porter reminded me how truly great a beer can be
4603,Anchor Porter,4.46,tasty

4609,Anchor Porter,4.54,delightful dark roast coffee flavors with a hint of chocolate crisp light and ultimately refreshing about as good a porter as any ive tried
4610,Samuel Adams Latitude 48 IPA,2.24,medium orange hue very seethrough obviously filtered  noticeable bitterness  hop aroma in the nose  nice white head good lacing throughout  as for the tastewhere did the hops go theyre in the nose but vanish on the tongue tastes very much like a lager to me this has 3 months left on its best before date so cant blame it on age  watery with no discernable flavor a touch of bitterness on the back end but hardly noticeable after an interesting nose this macro falls way flat
4611,Kirin Lager,2.19,may 2002 the bad thing about living in norway is the price of beer the good thing however is that those of us who live near the coast and have a small boat yes like me can catch our own seafood  for free todays freshly caught crab was my chosen accompaniment with kirin lager  a good choice i believed as the japanese love seafood more than anyone else in the world im sorry to say that most european pilseners  light lagers would have been a better choice than this one there is very little aroma the beer is dry which is a good thing when you have it with seafood but some more flavour would have been good too  aftertaste is metallic surely the japanese can do better than this
4612,Kirin Lager,3,t19
4613,Kirin Lager,3,had a few of these with dinner at a japanese restaurant several years ago i dont remember anything special either good or bad about it it went well with the food and tasted ok hence the average rating of 3
4614,Keene Idea,4.37,old school piney crisp westie just a style that isnt brewed enough these days and its a real shame kick you in the teeth bitter  pours a delicious golden amber and perfectly carbed very sippable not sure it lives up to the godlike status some hold it in but its a very solid west coast ipa
4615,Keene Idea,4.44,not sure why people feel the need to write reviews along the lines of its an old style not fit for todays trendsit was brewed to be a piney bitter and malty beer and its damn well crafted if you were into trendy scotch drinks and were handed a glass of louis xiii cognac would you poopoo it for being different old school west coast ipas exist for a reason and they have certain qualities that make them different from the trendier new england style this beer is a fantastic brew with pine and malt flavors bursting onto the scene in a way you just dont find with most beers made elsewhere when you take a sip you just know it is a well crafted and balanced brew
4616,Keene Idea,3.75,no no no no i cant understand how everyone takes this wellbalanced yet boring double ipa and elevates it to a godly status its fine but the flavors scent and mouthfeel stop there as a california born dude i above all want to champion our beers this is fine but its just not the champ
4617,Keene Idea,4.28,many reviews talk about the perfect balance between malt and hops displayed by this beer theyre not wrong this beer has seen the tightrope strung across the canyon of drinkability and confidently trod the cord using malt and hops as its balance beam while declining to use any of the 2020s juiciness for a safety net  make no mistake this is a bitter beer it demands an experienced drinkers palate but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy piney resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double ipa genes  in reality this is an anachronism in 2022 it recalls the ibu wars of 15 years ago but remains relevant because at the end of the day its a damn good beer  cheers
4618,Keene Idea,4.78,pours golden in color with a nice head that leaves a beautiful lacing the nose is slightly sweet almost honey like hint but a bitterness added taste is bitter that quickly goes away with a dry finish superb beer
4619,Keene Idea,4.02,nearly clear amber brew with plenty of foam in the fat wheat beer glass lush with creamy carbonation malty and medium sweet aromatic with citrus and papaya taste is candied bitter orange or marmalade very sippable and well made  hops are listed at citra southern cross nelson and pacific jade this dipa bears the extra alcohol and malt well a little of a hop overdose as you might expect i have not had an alpine beer in years so was happy to try one i had not seen brewed in san diego from the 16 oz can dated 102521
4620,IPA,4.19,poured out of a 12 oz can into one of my pint glasses this beer pours a clear medium to dark golden color has a white head thats about an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to very thick layer of surface foam a thick ring lining the inside of the glass and excellent lacing aromas of some bready malts w a bit of caramel along w piney floral and citrus hop notes flavors of the aforementioned bready slightly zest malts w a nice bit of caramel sweetness gives way to the also aforementioned piney floral and citrus hop that provide the perfect amount of bitterness while there is a good amount of malts the hope certainly dominate the flavor profile here which is as it should be has a has a crisp slightly oily smooth medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation has a clean finish and a nice after taste easy to drink in the good way a well crafted ipa ought to be  eric
4621,IPA,4.29,brewers notes true to form and always consistent ipa sets the standard for the india pale ale category with an impeccable blend of hops from the pacific northwest ipa pours with a lofty white head and light copper hue with aromas of freshlypeeled orange grapefruit and soft tropical notes  can received in bif17 from ovaltine  poured into a pretentious beer glass  clear golden liquid craggy two finger white foam cap good retention good lacings  aroma is piney  citrus orange mrs windrrllama claims to smell onions  i have never found that in a beer and applaud her recognition of that scentv  taste is pine citrus orange  smooth not bitter clean  crisp  hop kiss on the finish  good beer
4622,IPA,4.31,wonderful golden colour with a head retention of a few seconds the aroma is dank piney and insanely inviting very dry overall but not in an imbalanced way with the lingering bitterness asking you to have another sip medium body a delicious ipa that would be an excellent accompaniment to food thank you jzeilinger
4623,IPA,3.82,poured from the can into a spiegelau ipa glass canned august 2nd 2022 pushing it here for freshness but at least it was in the cold case  beautiful looking ipa deep amber bodied with crystal copper colors and light appearances of carbonation off white head definitely near the khaki yellow colored realm with simple classic three to four finger height lots of staying power barely budging at all with massive retention just a great looking bold ipa  unfortunately hints of classic faded hops on the nose with a soft caramel dominating and leafy touches of herbs if a bit small on the nose still theres a nice floral pungency here if understated  palate seems fairly old school touches of leafy sage like herbal hops with a big emphasis on tea green flavors finish with soft caramel and more leafy like tea flavors and mild senses of bitterness mild touches of pine and earth in the finish  decent but i think i might have missed the boat on this one this definitely needs a revisit from me in the fresh future cause there is some quality in here
4624,IPA,4.49,a really good ipa super hoppy nice bitterness a bit of a mango flavor to it
4625,IPA,4.41,its a good ipa everyone in here poops their pants over an ipa lol beer snobs need their own place

4629,Juice Jolt,2.22,this is not good beer at all its billed as a juicy ipa but tastes like a cheapo artificially flavored mango lager thats so prevalent these days very disappointing
4630,Juice Jolt,3.8,sweet juicy ipa  very refreshing tastes like a fruit punch
4631,Juice Jolt,3.58,appearance clean golden amber nice offwhite head and no lace  aroma straight up fruit punch  taste unusual more of the fruit punch hops and malts almost integrate seamlessly solid and enjoyable
4632,Juice Jolt,2.38,best by 121223 poured into a ba 25th ann teku  hell yeah  a mildly hazy orangeamber with 1finger offwhite head with belowaverage retention and a skimpy line of lacing  s aroma is very chemicalartificial and smells like citrustropical tums  t flavor is also very much like a slurry of citrus and tropical tums into a zima alcohol flavor adds an unpleasant berry component to the mix  m fairly light bodied with high carbonation and chemical extract and tumsaspirin mineral finish  o really a poorly executed beer on multiple levels
4633,Juice Jolt,1.97,looks like beer kind of smells like an alcoholic gatorade taste is like a grapefruit sports drink kids cough syrup this could possibly be the worst beer i ever had im sad i have 2 more cans of this will probably pound them here in a few mins just to be rid of them feels like beer kind of yuck
4634,Juice Jolt,2,awful tastes terribly artificial i wouldnt even consider this beer southern tier you should be ashamed of yourselves the fact that it has alcohol in it is its only redeeming quality
4635,Juice Jolt,1.18,im not sure what natural flavoring they added to this but it smells and tastes very artificial not like beer at all they really should have to include this stuff on the box
4636,Juice Jolt,1.37,i just spent an hour in the car listening to chris truskey talk about which pair of stretchy pants he likes the most when we decided to stop in erie for lunch and i had this beer it was almost as bad as his stories  im not sure what the intent here was it was instantly the worst thing ive put in my mouth for some time it was like a moldy dying orange fell into the beer tank it tastes like an old dying woman i thought maybe it was me but then everyone else hated it as well even chris who was on his second plate of nachos  i like this brewery but they need to get this off the market it may be the worst beer ive ever had even worse than the beer i made at home  phew what a stinker  back in the car chris is talking about his favorite brand of toilet paper

4649,Natty Daddy (8%),4.59,again beer snobs a good high gravity lager 8 percent abv 5 carbs real good bud light 42 abv 68 carbs cheap not that bad tasting 119 a can unless you wants to get really ripped aka earthquake beer snobs blah a good high gravity lager at a good price steel reserve 139 in ohio budwieser should get credit for natty ice natty even natural light for putting out budget beers that are good bud light blah
4650,Natty Daddy (8%),1.92,this is the perfect beer to use to bait the slug  snail traps in my garden ive found that slugs dont generally like the higher abv ipas but they gravitate towards this stuff and the 8 abv knocks them right out to then drown in the container and at 150 for a 25oz can its also the least expensive option so i always have a few cans on hand during the gardening season to thin out the slug population whenever i find that they have been foraging on my young plants i would never drink this stuff though in fact i feel embarrassed even buying it and find myself explaining to the bewildered check out girl what im actually using it for cheers
4651,Natty Daddy (8%),5,just a great beer
4652,Natty Daddy (8%),2.49,cheap beer about the only two things going for it is its healthy alcohol content and its appley taste
4653,Natty Daddy (8%),2.11,first 3 sips is tolerablecheap for a malt halfcan not bad once the 8 abv kicks in oh yeah knock two of these on an empty stomach and as jessie says youre in a world of pain you wont be tasting much of anything after a can or two of these for sure including those cheap burritos you also got from local grab and go
4654,Natty Daddy (8%),2.65,welp i can see how the other alcoholics have found this glorious beer towards the bitter end of their drinking cave it is such a deliciously cozy end of the line beer so high in abv just chilling there on the shelf trying to blend in with the usual suspects so cheap and so easy to find at the grocery store  i went to the grocery store as it was closing the registers were all closed the sliding entry doors were closed i could only go through the exit i was already drunk so i was okay with breaking the rules on my right as i entered through the exit sliders which opened right up for me as most things do when im drunk especially when they know they really shouldnt were some cases of all the familiar beers stacked up i carefully examined them to search the abv my eyes scanning the boxes like terminator or better yet bladerunner quite instantly i noticed the natty daddy the 8 abv glaring at me like a replicant pupils not dialating properly or whatever the heck harrison ford was picking up on in that scene i had already read about this particular beer on the reddit forums for alcoholism i had an aha moment when i saw the 8abv and the attractive low price brilliant advertising it was the easiest choice i have ever made the only choice thank you natty daddy no i take it back thank you anheiser busch for providing us with an 8abv beer that we can easily pick up in a 12 pack at the front of the grocery store beyond the checkout lines when the grocery store is trying to close and has its checkouts and entryways blocked off but there are still stragglers waiting in line and i can sneak in there and buy this tasty and easy to drink poison and its cheap happy fourth of july  overall its a 32 a cheap disgusting beer with a high abv at a great price god bless america  edit overall its a 35 its even better when cold imagine that im drinking the one that i stuck in the freezer which became nice and chilled after i forced down the first one im pleasantly surprised
4655,Natty Daddy (8%),3.6,i dont have much experience between really cheap high abv beer and really expensive low abv beer now clearly these are not my favorite but they are a beer i drink often as a college student with cheap taste you cant really go wrong with this if your primary goal is to get drunk at the cheapest price possible
4656,Natty Daddy (8%),1.37,so as a stand alone beer this one is pretty bad tastes bad like metal smells weird hard to explain looks decent when poured into a glass with a nice color and some decent head pretty deceiving however if you need to get plastered then this is the cheapest way to go it isnt pretty but so wasnt that girl you took home last night from the family reunion  now as a side note i did try an experiment with this beer got a case of it mixed it with some vodka hawaiian punch orange juice and a bunch of fruit and damn it made a great powerful jungle juice may or may not have killed some livers though experiment at your own risk
4657,Natty Daddy (8%),5,
4658,Natty Daddy (8%),1.87,weirdly smells and tastes of smores i dont know what it is but that is the flavor i get off of it
4659,Natty Daddy (8%),2.17,25oz can date code 22223 poured into a pint glass  a  gold with a white head lively carbonation rising through the glass  s  malt and adjunctforward  t  follows the nose abv is noticeable on the finish  f  thinbodied high carbonation watery finish  o  not bad but not great by any means ymmv
4660,Natty Daddy (8%),1.89,very light golden color with a large white head the smell is a skunky light malt smell the taste is grainy and watered down overall its not good just my opinion
4661,Natty Daddy (8%),1.88,expected this to drink harsh with the primary peers being icehouse edge and steel reserve and of course it drank harsh this category is not at all for the drinking experience rather for getting sloshed so i dont feel compelled to fault it for that especially at its price point it holds up well against ihe and sr overall all things considered but thats really not saying much however theres an entirely unwelcome sweetness here that sometimes makes me wish id opted for the others still at 169 per 25oz in my area it easily wins against icehouse edge and steel reserve as the absolute most costeffective buzz that can be had from beer and nowadays is actually cheaper than soft drinks ultimately achieves what it sets out to do for what its worth
4662,Natty Daddy (8%),1,i picked up a 12 pak of this just to try something different thank you to anheuser busch for allowing to experience what eating a yeast infected pussy tastes like
4663,Natty Daddy (8%),2.21,poured from a 25oz can  appearance is not promising on the pour large soda like bubbles that never get over 1 finger and very lively carbonation color is a dark straw to light gold looks like cheap lager head a few minutes in is just a ring around the glass  aroma is what youd expect cheap beer not necessarily revolting but not appealing it kind of just smells old and oxidized with a tart slightly off aal lager yeast aroma zero hops detectable not great but ive smelled worse unfortunately not many  flavor is not the same as the smell but not better very light malt forward but the off flavors creep in quickly a slight tartness and alcohol bitterness and burn are all present at first it reminded me of expired budweiser with vodka in it as you drink the 8 beer the flavor becomes more palatable not terrible but theres a lot off  feel is surprisingly easy to put down and the carbonation isnt too intense the head comes back into existence a bit to give it some thickness and smoothen it out a little its drinkable but in the stomach it is quite heavy and the abv makes it a bit ridiculous that in the mouth at least its this easy to drink quick  overall its bad but not to the point where every sip is regret and the abv makes it get better over time this beer certainly had a time and a place but generally its not a great one to be in it gets you real drunk without being completely disgusting

4665,Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.58,likely the best pale ale ive ever had just hits every note  perfect balance ton of flavor if i could have this in my beer fridge at all times i would it just curb stomps the vast majority of pale ales ive had great citrus flavors nice body surprising high abv for a pale which probably helps the flavor profile but im not taking that as a detraction  this is a fantastic beverage
4666,Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.43,deep orange in color no head created at all nose was the least desirable quality mainly due to not much there especially given the color and extreme citrus taste taste is the magical moment superb beer surprised it is not considered a ne style though

4668,Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.49,one month old can to wine glass  look pours a pale but somehow full and hazy yellow with a largepored white head that dissipates quickly without leaving any lacing no floaters  smell fresh citrus notes mainly lemon with hints of grapefruit  taste yellow citrus fruits fresh and hoppy zesty and bitter body with a dry finish low sweetness  feel very juicy with a medium carbonation and a sharp zesty punch  overall full and juicy pale ale with a strong focus on fresh citrus fruits could easily be mistaken for a dipa very challenging compared to other pale ales with its full body and its dry finish great beer very intense
4669,Celebration,4.74,this is almost perfect as an ipa being full of flavor and well rounded with a slightly more malty flavor than some but that spells delicious

4673,Celebration,5,this is a perfect example of an old school american ipa i look forward to it every year and lament its passing at the end of each winter season steeped with history its classic use of chinook cascade and centennial is unmatched bringing the bright piney citrus flavor you come to expect from the west coast  if you like american ipas this is one you should be required by law to try pick one up if its available youll be so happy you did

4676,King Julius,5,excellent
4677,King Julius,4.62,a  pours a hazy orange with a one finger creamy white head heavy amount of soapy lacing  s  aroma is orange mango and pineapple  t  the taste follows the aroma with orange juice pineapple mango cantaloupe and a light bitterness in the finish  m  medium body with medium carbonation creamy mouthfeel with a soft crisp finish  o  this is a top notch neipa

4679,King Julius,4.48,pours a dark orange totally opaque small head that disappears quickly but with good lacing nose is faint mangos taste is a soft mango and peach with some bitterness i liked this better than fresh julius a good hazy better than most but not so amazing you should drive 400 miles i enjoyed tree house but its annoying you have to pay for full pours and cant pay to try several things and see what you like
4680,Fuzzy,4.55,im finding i am really enjoying white peaches specifically in wild ales just lend themselves to barrel funk and botanicals so well here sp has done well to allowing the juicy peach tones shine too smell is damn impressive sour peach yogurt barnyard and barrel funks bright and rustic oak pressed flowers dry earth a touch of lemon and lime zest and finished with big hay taste is more sour and less complex with funk losing the barrel variety to the sour fruits otherwise the same with sneaky complexity yet potent feel is sour and decently acidic but gentle dries out with various funks almost feels more pungent than it tastes or smells clear yellow body with a pinky finger of white foam this is right up there with the best peach wild ales little less acidity and it could be the very top
4681,Fuzzy,4.49,2022 vintage  here we are the 1 wild ale on ba for my 1500th review this is a special one that has been a long time want for me so im very excited to finally try it ive only had a few side project beers but theyve all been fantastic so i have no reason to think this one wouldnt be lets get into it  pours a cloudy pale gold with 2 fingers of whitehead that quickly fades to a ring and leaves no lacing  this is certainly tart in the nose but it has a surprisingly nice balance to it im picking up on aromas of tart peach lemon yogurt sharp oak tannic white wine straw bready malt wildflower honey apple skin light vinegar stone and even a touch of smoke  in taste it starts off with a balanced tartness similar to the aroma and on the back end explodes with an aggressive flash of tartness before settling down once again on the front end of the sip im tasting jammy peach lemon juice vanilla wet hay straw smooth oak leather and white grape the swallow brings notes of tart peach lemon juice crabapple white wine vinegar sharp oak wet hay vanilla bready malt and light peat smoke  a medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a puckering beer finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time  oh yeah this is damn good despite the not so good looks everything else here is awesome a truly unique beer
4682,Fuzzy,4.42,appearance  the beer was the color of a peach it was orange with red hues toward the center  smell  the beer smelled like sour peaches there was an undercurrent of sweetness like vanilla  taste  the profile was quite acidic like a soured peach notes of peach and peach skin were detected there seemed of be the presence of vanilla sweetness as well the profile had a nice sour peach finish  mouthfeel  the body had little carbonation but a pleasant smoothness  overall  this is a sour that i can enjoy and i am not a sour guy
4683,Fuzzy,4.57,this was a guest beer on tap during the 2021 zwanze day celebration i attended 2020 fuzzy at a years age  loved the nose on this stone fruit in season white peach and a hint of funk its tart without being overly sour with a nuanced finish more of the peach notes leaving the palate tingling fantastic
4684,Fuzzy,4.15,a tangerine pour with fiery hues to apricot the neck films a shade of macaroon cream thats dismissive per inscription from the preset retention howbeit an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility as the intervals thermally protract theres a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course while effervescence becomes a mobilized variance  s pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities illustrated by a bitingly tart eruption thats tamed enough for the developing  wild yeast  appearances the progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols which quietly idle funk steps principally satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold nonetheless acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks theres elements of solvency thru the open air drafts which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents on the other hand that piece is often stupefied given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops and biscuity malt brackets to stone fruit minerals  t a clean consecutive punchdown stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of goldrich apricots and armking nectarines while briny minerals perimeter neptune grass in correlation an engine for eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg while maintaining that peppery attenuation the ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk to that end the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place aerial attacks begin setting in from oak dragged elasticities and prompt in some leathery satchels whilst chardonnay attenuates a staleness for budapestl√§ngd with an oxidative nuttiness  m does not puncture with puckered acridity but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids namely a backend for rustic brettanomyces and a pillar for biscuity grains the approach is brisk in carbonation as the approach is crisp in sensation thus cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites but pleasingly uplifting in the dry  erosional  reliefs  o showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence thats costly to the preliminary entwines of wild yeast though development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities and make rational moves in this situation light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols the approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely drycrisp exhibition
4685,Fuzzy,4.43,look  great clear golden color with a slight white skimming smell  nice slight peach wild ale smell taste  fantastic peach easy going slight tart feel  crisp with a medium body overall  just fantastic
4686,Fuzzy,4.8,excelent beer
4687,Fuzzy,4.38,bottle generously shared by seth cloudy pale yellow pour with a white head sour peach aromas big tartsour notes with peach highlights lemon zest and citrus lowlights good body and mouthfeel
4688,Leche Borracho,4.9,178 good stuff
4689,Leche Borracho,4.64,appearance  the beer poured a deep black color with tan specks at the top that bring to mind spice  smell  the spice and delicious tequila were apparent in the nose  taste  at the front i was made to think of spicy cinnamon chocolate cookies notes of raisins ancho chili and tequila follow there was even a hint of lime after a few sips heat built up in the throat in the aftertaste  mouthfeel  the body was smooth and thick perhaps just above medium bodied carbonation was noted  overall  i love tequila aged stouts
4690,Leche Borracho,4.23,matte black with brown speckling and head this strikes me as a more chocolatey and spicy westbrook mexican cake plus bourbon and tequila backing obviously nice french toast effect with cinnamon some light caramel within the chocolate in the taste exclusively smooth feel in between pepper spice hits well done by the way and the spiced textures of the cinnamon taste is more clear in the flavors where smell is amalgamation of it all would take mexican cake over this but still very good
4691,Leche Borracho,4.39,2016 vintage 550ml bottle poured into a snifter  a pours jet black in color with a onefinger foamy khaki head that reduces to leave nothing behind  s aroma is rich with chocolate cinnamon and chili pepper up front followed by undertones of creamy lactose vanilla toffee and brown sugar the tequila barrel comes across as a mezcallike aroma with some oaky bourbon juice in the background  t rich malty chocolate up front quickly gives way to cinnamon and pepper skin midpalate brings out the barrel notes tequila takes center stage with some oaky bourbon complimenting the finish gives more cinnamon and chocolate with a linger of pepper and creamy lactose  m medium body with moderate carbonation foamy mouthfeel turns slightly creamy into the finish some pepper heat pokes through after the finish  o the barrel combo works well with this one well done
4692,Lone Star Light,3.36,from a can best by 41023 clear golden color with an inch of white fluffy head smells like straw light body tastes of sweet corn and straw should be rated higher this is a perfectly fine example of the style clean lager with some adjunct notes crushable if you want to make it a session beer
4693,Lone Star Light,3.4,first of all the picture of the bottle needs updated  this is not some great ipa or stout or craft beer this is good ol lone star light its great on hot summer day mowing the grass or hanging at the river its a good light beer if you want to drink light after over doing it the night before  i drink this when i go to concerts at the clubs here in south texas you can drink quite a bit and not get fed up  taste wise its much better than 95 of the light beers out there starts a bit sweet definite grain notes its not bitter goes down smooth  if you want a light easy drinking beer i totally recommend lsl but im also biased because im from texas
4694,Lone Star Light,2.75,a very nice lady gave this beer to me as part of a july 4 celebration so i am in a good mood as i write this the beer is what it is you have to give it light and refreshing and it tastes pretty good for a light lager i have had worse happy 4th
4695,Lone Star Light,2.91,poured from a bottle into a pint glass appearance  the beer pours a clear straw color with a one finger head of fizzy white foam the head fades superfast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass smell  the aroma of the brew is super light with just a little bit of caramel and malt along with these smells comes a touch of paper and herb taste  the taste begins with a light cracker taste matched by a little bit of caramel sweetness as the taste advances some paper and a touch of herb come to the tongue all while the sweetness increases just a bit to leave one with a still dry but light and crisp taste to linger on the tongue mouthfeel  the body is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is average the carbonation should be higher for the style to make it more refreshing overall  it is what it is i would choose an alternative light lager over this if looking for an easy session
4696,Lone Star Light,1.77,lone star light is just as musty and grainy as the og lone star with little of the character that makes it so distinctive its just not something id drink again if i had a choice and i do
4697,Lone Star Light,2.2,out of can in austin texas not as bad as i thought itd be tastes like its hydrating definitely cheap grains maybe corn kinda thicker texture a tiny bit metallic
4698,Lone Star Light,3.86,12 oz bottle poured into tulip feb 12 2018 bestby printed on bottle neck  l clear yellow srm 23 tops and so clear it looks like air in the glass yellowtinged air pushes up quicklydissipating head of white foam that eats at itself like a gose head bubbles everywhere and they push up a constant fluffy collar and most of a skin fun to watch not stick or lace  s stale grain sour grain yeast everywhere  loads and loads of dusty yeast as it warms hints of cracker malt show up subtle and lightly sweet  t grain stale grain big corn note midswallow through the finish and its not creamed corn but real live corn lots of yeast over time it gets some of that american adjunct lager housepaint note many of them have  hard to describe  might the yeast mixing with other notes  f that lightweightheavy carbonation combination us soda drinkers grew to love its over carbed of course but i still like it a lot  helps cleanse the palate  o the grain flavor is much much more prominent than i expected and while the nose isnt worthy of worldwide acclaim every now and again you can pick up a pinch of barley malt sweetness for the genre and at 385 abv its fantastic i dont expect much from an american light lager and this one easily surpasses those expectations
4699,Lone Star Light,1.6,these are cheap and easy to drink mostly because its water and can hydrate you better than gatorade on a hot summer day i believe you can only purchase the light version of this beer in texas
4700,Grain Belt Premium Light,2.38,this is pretty rough stuff one of the outwardly cheaper tasting beers in this style space heck of a lousy aftertaste but with some value when absolutely ice cold and i mean near freezing on a hot day if you can keep the clear glass out of the sun a few quick glugs can really wet the whistle but deeper analysis reveals only critique for me average looking yellow brew high shine fizzy at first but not keeping it the nose is metallic adjuncty all the way corny sweet to me a little floral but but really specifically from hops it doesnt seem some light struck character too and not a clean or crisp lager yeast profile its unresolved the flavor agrees and while the first half isnt bad some pils type malt at first the second half falls apart detergent paper pennies confectionary sugar cream corn i want to like this and even try a couple of bottles to make sure but i cant get there and the bottom pull or three from each is offensive cheap tasting as they come no lager crispness at all and even with good carbonation this feels off to me oddly sharp at temperature too stays on the palate too long and is just not a very good beer worse than the original by a considerable margin
4701,Grain Belt Premium Light,2.91,12oz bottle into a 12oz glass l pours crystal clear white straw yellow wa soapy 12 white head that goes to edge foam lightly bubbly carbonation  very little if any lacing s corn red apple rind sweet malt adjuncts t corn red apple light white bread light honey adjuncts gentle malts very light caramel a suggestion of ripe fruit f crisp  bright extremely clean light bodied mouth feel wa fairly fast semidrying finish o exactly what its labeled as a light lager very quaffable and bright tasting it is good in its style
4702,Grain Belt Premium Light,2.88,on tap at minnesotas oldest bar the rathskeller in new ulm good beer definitely lighter than its full blooded big brother would definitely have again
4703,Grain Belt Premium Light,2.29,llight straw color  sfaint grainy notes  tvery lightly flavored even for a light beer lacks the malt characteristics of several other american adjunct light beers i had a coors light right after this and the coors light had a much bigger malt flavor never imagined id be touting coors light strong malt notes  fvery watery and thin  oi love all things schell except for this was hoping for some resemblance to regular premo but not finding any similaritiesnot bad or cheap tasting just not much to taste i have no knowledge of the history of this beer and when it was introduced and if this is even the same recipe but whatever the case this lacks flavorany flavormy guess is it may have come out when minnesota brewing had the label and probably not a lot went into developing it like i said not sure if it is the same recipe but it could use a revisit by the experts at schells  actually tastes and drinks similar to miller 64 or mich ultra  as always scores are per style
4704,Grain Belt Premium Light,2.55,appearance extremely pale yellow ok head  smell more aroma than many light beers mild sweetness and fruitiness are detected  taste the smell carries over into the taste mild fruitiness and sweetness definitely tastes like a lighter version of regular grain belt much lighter in feel than premo  overall i wanted to try gb premo light so i bought a 12 pack im not a big fan of premo this light version is slightly preferable in my book not offensive easy to drink has a little bit of flavorhits the mark for a light beer
4705,Grain Belt Premium Light,2.75,grain belt premium light has a thin white head a clear fairly bubbly straw appearance and minimal lacing left behind the aroma is of sweet mild malt and the flavor is the same with almost no bitterness mouthfeel is light and watery and premium light finishes crisp and refreshing  rjt
4706,Grain Belt Premium Light,1.55,can drink all day and feel nothing
4707,Bigfoot,4.15,barleywinestyle not a barleywine this 2023 brew came up with a twofinger beige head when poured into a snifter malty nose the flavor is intriguing roast pine piney hops caramel the finish needs smoothed out with aging a little bitter which is ok and malt on the back end the label reads  or cellar   but i wont
4708,Bigfoot,3.97,l deep red color beige head forms at the pour thin half inch head dissipates slowly active carbonation maintains throughout the pint s malt caramel t malt warm smooth alcohol caramel again f fizzy and warmth piney feel works up through the nose o very nice beer will drink a couple and put a few away for later
4709,Bigfoot,3.91,a 2023 iteration bottled on january 12 2023 and poured into a tulip about five months later  pours darkamber brown excellent head initially it releases big bubbles from the bottom of the pour that slowly bubble up good retention and lacing  aromas of dark fruit and piney hops along with some modest citrus  the brew delivers initial stickybready caramelmalt sweetness balanced almost immediately by white pepper and pine hoppiness as the brew warms a distinct grapefruit citrus note rounds out the middle along with raisin peach and molasses some anise tobacco and leather are trying to manifest but need some time to mature not as boozy as feared there are quite a few different things going on here  full bodied for sure it nevertheless is very drying and tingly which makes each sip welcome  overall i understand why this brew can be polarizing because there is nothing subtle or nuanced about a newer bottle of this brew regardless this is a very flavorful american barleywine that is excellent but would probably be better with a little more age to smooth things out from what is currently pretty wild
4710,Bigfoot,4.15,this one appeared in our local grocery rural montana grocery store and and i thought it worth a try up front ill admit that the word barleywine grabbed my eye and i missed the word style while after buying the first sixpack for at our store a very reasonable price of 1150 i then came back for the other four i liked it very much for what it was not what it purported to be if you are looking for a barleywine this isnt it if instead you are looking for an very excellent dark imperial ipa this is the one hops to spare and definitely a worthwhile pint to keep in your stock if this sounds like it works for you then by all means grab some i am glad i found it
4711,Bigfoot,4.1,12 ounce bottle fridge chilled dark amber khaki foam aroma is a bit all over and it takes a moment to call out the pine and malt and woods taste is malty and hops balanced at first drink then comes apart on the palate caramel pine white pepper solid bitterness alcohol is present as it should be for the american barleywine style feel is midweight midcarb overall good sud a little busy but not in a bad way better as it warms
4712,Bigfoot,4.07,big flavors thick grainy consistency dry and bitter malt heavy first impression then the hops kick in with a piny and powdery finish some bitter gentian root flavors cocktail bitters a little too much sometimes raisins herbal mild sweetness is beaten back by the massive malt and hops very similar to a double or triple ipa if you like big and bitter this is it

4727,Hahn Super Dry,2.7,not the most exciting beer with minimal flavour but easy enough to drink
4728,Hahn Super Dry,3.12,an enhanced brewing process breaks down more of the natural sugars to deliver a genuine super dry taste with only a third of the carbs of standard full strength beerthis beer goes down quite easy
4729,Hahn Super Dry,1.64,australian budweiser flat taste with a chemicalesque finish would not recommend

4732,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,3.96,not so bad as the avg score here would imply decent balanced flavors and nice malt presence totally inoffensive to my tastes and only complaint being that its a bit thin and watery otherwise glad i tried this one
4733,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,3.55,united breweries taj mahal premium lager 45 abv pours clear yellow with a 3finger offwhite head that left some lacing nose is malty taste follows some grain light hop bitterness decent mouthfeel if a bit overcarbonated overall very good

4735,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,2.64,had a few large bottles over the course of 30 years it is best served very cold and in a small glass compliments food pretty well esp indian  latino cuisine it is fairly light bodied transparent light yellow ok carbo a thin white fast dissipating head that goes quickly to edge foam light spotty lacing has a light grassy aroma with some grains taste is fairly refreshing with grassy lightly dry hops and gentle malts thin feel and a slightly dry finish fast easy drinking beer reminds me of amstel light

4740,Damnation,4.03,look it pours yellow and quite clear with a pillow like white head it has excellent head retention  smell there is pronounced grainy malts in the aroma it has some light spices in the nose with a touch of pear  taste there are some belgian funk elements with malty grain there are some spicy elements with light banana and pear  feel it has a medium body with an easy drinking finish  overall the balance between flavors is quite good but the aroma is lighter than i like
4741,Damnation,4.13,serving 375 ml bottle bottled on 111722 poured into a 14 oz teku glass  appearance deep golden yellow with increasing haze as the bottle pours and a rocky thick head of white foam  smell grassy fruity pale malt and yeasty phenolic cloves and spice  taste more cloves pepper fruity but dry malt body  mouthfeel medium body and crisp carbonation  overall a solid belgianstyle golden ale with nice balance of malt hops and spicy funky yeast
4742,Damnation,4.27,review 1608 damnation russian river brewing date 08 may 2020 drinking through one of the lists on beeradovcate this beer is next on the docket i served the beer in a chalice around 46 degrees the pour created a massive twofingered creamy but airy white head the retention is excellent leaving gobs of lacing on the glass the color charts around srm 8 dark golden yellow with amber hues the clarity is clear with loads of carbonation a beautiful appearance  the aromas in the beer are cloves phenols floral toasted crackers banana a touch of funk and earthiness  i taste cloves phenols floral herbal green grass toasted crackers bready a hint of funk orange banana and earthiness  the mouthfeel is dry and spicy  the body is medium has high carbonation and has a lasting finish  i was expecting a big malty and spicy belgium beer i got a lighter malty belgium beer with a dry spicy finish a unique take on this style i enjoyed the differences in this beer
4743,Damnation,3.96,bottled 52720
4744,Damnation,3.03,i should issue a caveat the bottle shop had this labeled as a russian imperial stout you stout drinkers can imagine my disappointment it is not that this beer is bad looks smells tastes and feels like a belgian not a particularly good one so im surprised by the ratings its spicy banana belgian blah blah boredom all day long almost as if someone said lets brew a prototypical belgian and strong ale at 75 i have had abbey ales at 10 with heavy duty sediments and incredibly complex flavors those are belgian strong ales duvel though decidedly weaker than some is light years beyond this the temerity
4745,Damnation,4.23,inspired by duvel in style damnation exudes the sonoma terroir winey yet wonderfully dry the yeast reminds me of belgiums passionate pints particularly how the yeast works up the malts and a dash of pepper spritzy  because russian river produces mostly worldclass wilds and i shy from the style i am glad to see their excellence applied to the bspa preceded by two bay area cheeses damnation went wonderfully with an impromptu pasta dish with butter and italian parsley
4746,Darkness,4.58,2022 vintage  poured from a 16 ounce can dated 92822 into a snifter  look black opaque medium brown frothy head above average head retention and lacing  smell toasted oats cacao toffee medium strength of scent  taste coffee cacao cherry mildly sweet high strength of flavor  feel between medium and full body average carbonation moderately bitter mildly sweet moderately mouth coating moderately mouth warming  overall black with medium brown frothy head and above average head retention and lacing bouquet was medium in strength and dominated by toasted oats with notes of cacao and toffee taste was high in strength and a superbly balanced mix of coffee cacao and cherry feel was between medium and full body with moderate mouth warming and moderate coating properties overall the bouquet of this beer was more understated than expected but the rest of the attributes more than made up the difference providing an overall great drinking experience
4747,Darkness,4.33,a huge ris well appointed with robust fruit and chocolate an earthy and grass splash of hops and a long lingering alcohol warmth the finish is clean and impressive for it well done
4748,Darkness,4.12,traded for this ages ago probably from shogokawada thanks whoever it was 2008 vintage enjoyed on 3323 poured from a 750ml waxed and capped bottled into a snifter served lightly chilled  impenetrable seal brown liquid with a lasting dun collar fine lacing thick viscous legs surprisingly good retention  molasses chocolate covered cherries mediumroast coffee maple candy and complex malt in the nose  stale coffee milk chocolate weak tobacco and brown sugar on the palate low bitterness faint grapefruit but the hops have faded flavors are good but a bit flat though there are few other signs of oxidation medium finish with malt balls loam and plum pudding  mediumfull bodied creamy with decent carbonation abv is well integrated  after 15 years this is surely past its prime but remains a brooding stately gentleman of an ale
4749,Darkness,4.06,2016 vintage served at 52 degrees  while the color of this beer is like pretty much every other stout what stands out is the glorious thick and persistent dark tan colored head beautiful looking consistency and excellent lacing rare for me to think of a stout as anything above a 375 but this is getting a 45  nose isnt up to the same level as the look but its still really nice highlighted by loads of chocolate toffee and faint roast taste largely follows but with much more roast  coffee body is not quite as hefty as i anticipated i want to say its light but it also feels like a milkshake and those two things dont seem to make sense together so im not sure how to describe it regardless this is quite tasty glad i finally cracked it open
4750,Darkness,4.54,bomber blackwaxed darkness 2020 purchased off shelf at shangys last week poured into my trillium fat tulip  l tight creamy dark tan foam dark brown liquid bordering on black opaque head recedes into a splotchy cap and smeared collar but it laces lots in jagged fingeryflecked bands  s mint and espresso overtones bittersweet dark chocolate slowly emerging hints of roasted grains alcohol irish cream qualities a few beats later charred and deeply toasted caramelized grain kind of an overall typical ris aroma profile tonic outdoorsy top notes perhaps short of cinematic in scope but nonetheless invigorating  t big burst of bold flavors espresso toffee molasses cookie sweetish roasty residual underbelly and lightly campfiery roasted nutty overtones in the aftertaste big burp after a minute brings up sweetish sooty dark chocolate second big sip more of a rounded malt character with the interplay contrast and divide of heavy roast and rich crystal malts more stark still little booziness but some delicate spicy phenols and dark dried fruit notes starting to surface and not long after some subtle black licorice hop herbality finally opens up rising above the burnt bliss of sugars below  f cooling quality to its aromatics slick velvet texture lithe levity despite its luscious lines mediumfull bodied bordering on the latter malt milk attenuated and accentuated by the balance of booze dark nog ribsticking maybe its the 2 years on this but its heaven to my senses  o not the most nuanced but a pretty darn solid ris its sweetness is a touch more redolent than most style examples but luckily the roasted barley and hop bitterness are as intense lending some needed balance as expected its high marks are likely because of its relative unavailability this was the first time along with abrasive that ive encountered it out this way so i was easily compelled to buy a bottle 2086
4751,Darkness,4.6,this beer is dark but not dark like used motor oil smells of roasted coffee this is one beer where you definitely have to let sit out for awhile to really taste it has a strong malt taste and not boozy at all
4752,Darkness,4.34,2021 vintage  ive been sitting on this one for a minute now and im excited to finally try it an absolute classic ris and one that totally caught me off guard when i saw it at the store just sitting on the shelf this is also my first beer from surly so im even more hyped lets tackle this massive beast  pours a very dark brown with a finger of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  theres still a solid bitterness to this for being 2 years old which is quite surprising to me im picking up on aromas of leafy hops burnt caramel molasses dark chocolate charred wood dark roast coffee light vanilla and red grape  while still bitter in taste it feels like its integrated much better than the nose on the front end of the sip im tasting red grape cocoa powder charred malt caramel vanilla bean black cherry sweetened coffee light earthy hops and toffee the swallow brings notes of res grape black cherry molasses milk chocolate light roast coffee leafy hops vanilla bean sweet caramel and charred malt  a full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick and lightly boozy beer finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time  oh yeah this is really good warm and complex it develops over the course of the drink ill have to try other vintages
4753,Darkness,5,straight 5s sublime is my word for 2023 and it applies here labeled a ris this is not the traditional version while high in abv and pitch black it is super creamy and loaded with underlying tones of dark dried fruit like prunes figs or dates and subtle hints of cocoa and coffee i am not suggesting they are added but they are present in the flavor profile this stout is truly remarkable and i am so happy it is available locally pa for the first time in forever
4754,Darkness,4.6,canned 101922 enjoyed 1923 poured pitch black very slowly as the tan head was quite aggressive lots of lacing left as i sipped it down the aroma even to my damaged nose was dark fruit and caramelized sugar and roasted malts the taste was all that and more the flavor just kept coming the front was the sweet part and the middle the savory with the swallow bringing in the hops to keep it from going all mushy the feel was spot on a very nice sipper and just overall an excellent ris
4755,La Fin Du Monde,4.34,rereviewing because its been a dozen years since i last reviewed this  16oz can date code a2623 so packaged 1262023 into a hennepin glass pours a beautiful glowing deep golden color with a nice fluffy bright white head  aroma is funky and bready grassy yeasty esters clove spice overripe fruit banana bread  taste is sweet fruity funky more bready yeast or yeasty bread malty sugars spice old world hops some residual grain a vaguely bitter clean finish  mouthfeel is soft smooth full bodied referencelevel carbonation exemplary for the style  overall this is still one of my favorite belgian tripelsla fin du monde never disappoints _____________  previous review 6212011 preserved for posterity  4445  rdev 28 look 45  smell 425  taste 45  feel 45  overall 45 12oz bottle best before 7912 poured into a tulip  golden yellow beer w a huge bright white head that defies gravity leaves behind a beautiful film of lace  nose is all belgian yeast clean pale malt and slight alcohol  taste is just so smooth pale malt sweet candi sugar overripe banana and a slight warming from the alcohol  mouthfeel is luxurious so seductively smooth and drinkable  overall an outstanding version of the style this beer would be a perfect pairing with so many foods strong enough to stand up to anything but never dominant just a worldclass beer that i think anyone would enjoy
4756,La Fin Du Monde,4.28,poured from 12oz bottle to a goblet glass look is the color of honey with an off white creamy head very active carbonation keeps streaming to the cap smell is spicy and fruity a good dose of clove and malt taste is sweet up front with a blast of clove honey and malt middle of the sip gets briefly bitter then hits with some candy apple sweettart flavors finish is alcohol more spice and a bit of malt feel is medium bodied with soft plentiful carbonation that creamy head never goes away and allows for a nice soft mouthfeel overall i am enjoying this beer ill be working my way through the sample 6er this is a nice drinker that id have again the alcohol is clearly present which forces you to slow down and just enjoy
4757,La Fin Du Monde,4.79,in competition for one of my favorite beers of alltime its everything a tripel should be the funky yeast is complex with lots of desserty flavors reminds me of boston brown bread when cold like sweet molasses opens up wildly when it warms up malty with spices honeytoastymead a standout even amongst toptier worldclass beers
4758,La Fin Du Monde,4.35,part of a unibroue mixed 6pack pours a gold color with a minimal head that lasts quite a while aroma of wheat and spices taste is spicy with a good alcohol warmth
4759,La Fin Du Monde,4.57,this is one of the only tripels produced outside of belgium that i feel truly embodies the style world class yeast flavor and i dont say that lightly a very refined beer indeed
4760,La Fin Du Monde,4.14,honey gold transluscent no lacing fairly short lived 2 finger white head in a tulip glass long lasting carbonation rising smell  flavor clove no detectable banana imo moderately heavy body with relatively lively carbonation very nice but had hoped for a little more complexity given the world class rating
4761,La Fin Du Monde,4,orangecopper cloudy huge white head lasts and lasts clove like smell with an intense phenolic aroma i dont detect a lot of banana tastes sweet cloves syrup dark bread no hops are detectable but im sure theres enough there mouthfeel is medium heavy not your grandpas lager
4762,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,1,they make p water beer and have 10 mg thc drinks which are also trash and barely even get you high cannot wait till this company is over and finished with
4763,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,2.25,tried this one a while back hoping that maybe i would like it better than the original i did not just a weaker less flavored version of pbr could have been negatively impacted by my lifelong disdain for pbr but i dont like it
4764,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,3.13,clear pale gold with three fingers of white three minute head splotches of lace smell is grain bin taste is grains bread crust and a tiny bit of grassy herbal hops mouthfeel is light with strong carbonation finish is lightly dry and mildly bitter overall for the style it is just ok drink cold for best results
4765,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,2.22,not much to really say about pabst light looks tastes and smells like municipal water while i wasnt expecting it to be great it still managed to disappoint me one to get if youre in for disappointment
4766,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,3.31,pabst blue ribbon light  ahhh yes this is quite comical never even knew there was a light version of good ole pbr drank about ten thousand regular ones on my college days friend came over with a mixed thirty of  who knows what  out of his now deceased grandfathers basement not even sure if this stuff is brewed anymore oh well for the sake of experimentation  look  surprisingly deep yellow with a big frothy white head that pops and splats like soap bubbles carbonation is fairly high as expected head actually retained quite well and left a bit of lacing to my shock 35  smell  grains are on high much like its older brother adjuncts are clearly apparent though do not lead the way which is always a plus a bit of an alcoholic smell despite the low abv 3  taste  bit fresh bready grain ordeal going on right from the get go adjuncts fall to the back end and youre met with that slight grape flavor pabst is typically famous for must admit it tastes exactly like its big brother even if this beer is old it has held up quite well 35  feel  the body is as watery and smooth as ever with a massive dosage of carbonation feels thin even for a light lager 275  overall  im honesty more impressed than my score may lead you to believe i will admit i have and always will have a soft spot for pbr and they managed to pack the majority of big brothers flavor and all aspects into a little brother version cannot complain a bit  35
4767,Camo Black Extra,1.42,hello everyone its been a decade or two its been a long time since i found a new malt liquor but the malt liquor expert is back i saw something one the shelf called camo black xextrax i was hanging out with a 23 year old alcoholic and vaper took me to a vape shop where apparently all the kids are doing pastelcolored vapes and taking delta8 hempderived thc gummies and all the gaudy neon lights brought me back to the good old days of being a 23year old degenerate our selections were informed by the very helpful recovering meth addict behind the counter who even provided legal advice on what i could and couldnt bring back to florida with me when my vacation was over  naturally with all the nostalgia of legal loophole drug addicts taking me to weird head shops i demanded we pick up a fowdie  at the corner store i was disappointed that oe now comes in 42 ounce containers the fouwdie of my youth was gone but there right next to it was the perfect thing i could have come across that night a completely unfamiliar malt liquor furthermore the sketchiest looking design i could possibly imagine this would be a good night  smell is pure acetaldehyde may as well call this green apple flavored first swig reveals again nothing but a tart green apple flavor with nothing else to accompany it however after a few swigs a hint of acetone can be detected  all in all fun night of debauchery would recommend pairs well with a forty and half a philly cheesesteak
4768,Camo Black Extra,1.28,welp i came back for more and this one is the big boy  poured from a 24oz can  on the pour it isnt promising a fizzy barely 1 finger white head came and went like i poured a soda body is pushing a light amber color  aroma is not identifiable as beer smells like somebody added tequila to wine and let it sit out in the sun  taste is exactly the aroma but sweeter and with an offputting bitterness thankfully flavor doesnt linger  feel is a redeeming value somehow this feels better than the camo 900 with a lower abv in that there is much less of a syrupy feeling and everything fades incredibly fast making it at least consumable incredibly carbonated and is almost vapourous  overall i shouldve known after giving camo 900 a shot the only redeeming value is the priceabv ratio is quite good
4769,Camo Black Extra,1.23,i now know why a dog licks his or hers but you have to get the flavor off some how
4770,Camo Black Extra,3.53,clear gold with two fingers of white head some rings of lace smell is apple and grain taste is sweet apple or pear juice some grain no apparent hops mouthfeel is medium with ample carbonation finish is dry and sweet overall a big beer
4771,Camo Black Extra,3.51,24 fl oz can purchased cold poured into a goose island chalice  l crystalclear brassy gold colored liquid foam loudly sizzles away upon pour looks like sparkling apple cider no lace no collar  s initial aromatic pop includes sweetnessessence of pale malt leaping forward backed quickly by what can only be described as spiced powdered donut or those pfeffern√ºsse cookies standard malt liquor smells with only a mild extra kick of ethanol which as it sits later develops into an almost watery blendedscotch andor spiked used fryer oil scent the raw booze does eventually take a lil precedence but the malty wash in each sip snuffs out that sensation  t malt flavor almost has a lightlybuttery shortbreadsugarcookie quality   that hits first but a torrent of spicy sweetish booze charges past leaving a light peppery note up front in the palate while the now vaguely syrupy malt bounces back to the middle of the palate behind the wake of fire not terribly sweet either balanced enough by the strident booze andor the carefullycrafted degree of grassyherbal imported hops added the more one gets into it the more it tastes like a maltloaded lowabv apple brandy  f not too carbonated not all that viscous not much bite from the alcohol  rather dull on the palate but it also doesnt quite feel like its around 12 id say champagne is more taxing to the senses gotta get warmed up but this is a walk in the park  o really not all that bad considering well everything about it my brother and i during the initial stages of a daylong beer tasting hangout shared a half a can last week and we both agreed while it wasnt terrible it could be difficult without training to get through a whole 24 oz solo best to drink this from the can and relatively cold would not be opposed to buying this again if the situation feeling and company called for it  could pair well with some battered whiting and a sweet potato pie a little greasy mound of collards and a knuckle of corn bread would pull it all together rather splendidly
4772,Camo Black Extra,4.64,goes down about as smooth as silk and it gets you right smells like a college basement party in northern wisconsin without a single cracked window in sight so i suppose that means it smells like high life or mgd coupled with sweaty baseball caps i almost tasted alcohol on this one and although other reviewers claim an apple taste id like to claim a significant pear aftertaste shes a good beer the can says it uses imported hops as well if that means something to you only reason she isnt a five is because shes about as flat as a red dog
4773,Camo Black Extra,1,this is not just the worst beer ive ever had it is the worst beverage product period flavor pallet includes vicks cough syrup rotten fruit floor cleaner and wood glue this is the beer you buy to give to someone you absolutely despise and its murderous hate you buy them 2
4774,Camo Black Extra,1.41,24 fl oz can 1220 abv  f  avoid
4775,Camo Black Extra,1.9,man this is some gnarly stuff aroma really wasnt too bad fruit caramel spice some corn flavor is super sweet and massive alcohol body is very heavy and finish was like the aftertaste of sucking on a sugar cube cant drink this
4776,Camo Black Extra,1,well the good news is your gonna get ripped the bad news is everything else
4777,Camo Black Extra,1.12,i bought two of these 24oz cans for 199 each and i knew they would be terrible but they were worse than i thought the first one wasnt so bad but by the second one it was too much to handle i ended up puking on the last drink of the last one just trying to force it down
4778,Camo Black Extra,1.05,i once chewed up dried peyote buttons later in life i sampled a special mineral water from utah both these things tasted worse than anything i have ever put in my mouth the peyote high was awesome though after i threw up  camo black is right up there with them i poured it into a frosted glass took a sip and spit it out then poured it down the drain avoid avoid avoid it is terrible

4781,Camo Black Extra,5,there is no better description of the perfect beer than this very efficient very cost effective light on the calories for the punch it packs and the perfect beer for drinking in a trailer park if you complain about the burn of this you probably should just quit drinking now this is the perfect compliment to some good ol mcnaughtons whiskey southern comfort or wild turkey wild turkey chased with camo always reminds me of this scene girl from back in the day who introduced me to heavens own blend of the two you really just dont get much better than camo extra black the hangover is probably the best part it lasts all of about 1530 minutes and then youre set to go for the day two or three cans of this and a fifth of rr and youre set for a night of graveyard partying streaking and just good old blacked out fun
4782,Camo Black Extra,1.78,seeing as how camo black ice was just about the shittiest malt liquor to pass these lips it was only fitting to try the extra version to truly plumb the depths of the worst beers on the planet for science heres to bad decisions  bright saturated orange color rapid champagne carbonation thin layer of white foam on the surface that does lace slightly audibly fizzy foam crackles like rice krispies  smells like artificial grape flavoring energy drink and flintstones vitamins  tastes godawful very harshly astringent vague paper and grape juice flavors descending into utter malaise and ennui way overcarbonated and fizzy rapidly fades into a numbing boozy aftertaste  even drinking this as cold as possible doesnt help mask the terrible taste if you are just looking to get drunk whiskey is a far better option  delightful story about camo httpgooglukrqxu  from the owner its a unique category that appeals to college students and the ethnic market its definitely skewed toward the male market
4783,Dreadnaught,4.01,i dig it but a little too bitter and im a little too bitter
4784,Dreadnaught,4.17,i remember once upon a time when this was the highest rated double ipa on beeradvocate and i could not get it in my area much time has passed and i am really grateful i can now get this beer where i live 16 ounce can 3172023 born on date i imagine this would be even more impressive when sampled closer to the born on date but its still a pretty fresh sample fruit flavors are pineapple and peach alcohol is very well concealed this is a sweet and juicy sample of the style i prefer crisper versions but if i see this on tap im going for it
4785,Dreadnaught,4.65,best ipa ive had yet
4786,Dreadnaught,4.42,poured into a seattle beer week pint glass pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a three finger white head with great retention and solid lacing looks nice aroma of biscuit malt citrus hops lemon orange grapefruit and some dankness flavor is biscuit and light dry caramel malt citrus and piney hops grapefruit orange pine mild mixed tropical fruit a little rye resinous pine and citrus rind finish with great alpha oil bitterness medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess glad to finally try something from this venerable brewery and im glad i started with this getting an ipa from the midwest that has substantial bitterness is a joy in this hazy age and this is one solid ipa the malt is somewhat old fashioned with good biscuit notes but the hops are classic nw ipa which is my favorite profile lots going on here and quite enjoyable this ipa has been off my radar im going to try to snag a gumball head next one of my favorite ale names looks smells and tastes great
4787,Dreadnaught,4.35,pours out of the can a gently hazy deep copper with a nice two finger white head and great retention laaaazy bubbles up the side of the glass smells piney resinous and like ripe citrus tastes leans heavier on the pine and resin and hits you a bit with the alcohol i think on the third sip i was starting to find the malt notes that are advertised on the can if im honest its really well done but the alcohol is a tad bit distracting from the overall flavor but not enough to bring its score down too bad its a robust mouthfeel and is carbonated expertly glad i got to try this old school imperial that ive heard was a game changer years ago
4788,Dreadnaught,4.43,from a tap delivered inside a clear pint glass it came its beautifully and brightly copperamber with a very modest offwhite head the aroma although not pronounced brings ipa hops and malt theres a little too much alcohol to taste to keep it from excellence but the abv is 94 for goodness sake the malt body is rich and up to carrying the hops and most of the alcohol as it should be the hops both citrusy and earthy dominate the outstanding taste
4789,Dreadnaught,4.5,special stuff from a special outfit l from the canon mccann is very stylish and somewhat psychedelic s big citrus hoppy aroma simply delicious t just awesome and special the bitterness is almost overwhelming at times all kinds of happy goodness flavors lotta citrus pine f smooth and rich o this is a terrific beer and im always thrilled when i find it
4790,Dreadnaught,4.38,deep orange with chill haze big white head excellent retention thick rings of lace musky tropical fruit some pine sweet citrus a bit of dank hints of rich caramelly malt aroma sweeter than id like lots of rich caramelly malt citrus especially grapefruit and orange some pineapple and mango flavors hints of pine mediumheavy bodied with appropriate carbonation slightly cloying heavy syrupy bodied keeps this from being drinkable but otherwise exemplary
4791,Dreadnaught,3.79,16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for 489 canned on 31723 so this is five weeks and a day old  look it pours out a very nice light orange amber color with very tiny floaties the two fingers of rocky beigecolored head slowly dissipated looks like a nice imperial ipa  smell it smells super piney along with a bit of citrus notes i get orange peel and some pepper theres also some sweet malt notes and some boozy bubble gum notes for a beer that is this big the nose is underwhelming  taste this is a huge imperial ipa at 94 abv it really does not taste nearly as strong as it is its dangerously drinkable and its actually somewhat balanced up front its malty and sweet for a very short time before the hop bitterness takes over the finish is very bitter and earthy with huge pine notes and grapefruit peel and it lingers super long eventually orange peel and caramelcrystal notes come forward after the bitter hop resins fade from the front of the palate after pouring the bottom of the can the body improved a bit but the taste also became slightly chalkier  feel its medium plus bodied with a nice chewy slick and slightly oily mouthfeel  overall this is definitely a solid imperial ipa i can appreciate this beer but its not really my personal preference to go seeking this out again i may have had it many years ago via beer trade but at that time i was just looking to seek out the big beers that were highly rated and i may not have even had an imperial ipa before so it was worth trying again  from the can an imperial india pale ale with an intense citrus hop aroma a huge malt body and a crisp finish
4792,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.42,500ml bottle marked l33170 poured into a nonic pint glass at fridge temp 15 abv the beer pours a little more than hefehazy in a dull amber the head isnt much but the pencil thin ring and island did hang in for a minute minimal lacing the aroma is mild vaguely sweet with some orchard fruit and hints of rotten grain the taste is sticky sweet with some caramel and more applepear and tongue numbing ethanol negligible bitterness the mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a decidedly undry finish overall a middling high abv malt liquor a lithuanian tick and nothing that could ever resemble an imperial pils
4793,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.63,clear dark amber with a small ivory head that vanishes in a blink the aroma is sweet caramel malt and hints of cheap whiskey or rum some grassy notes the taste is also sweet caramel malt and brown sugar or molasses with rum plenty of alcohol taste and burn the finish is still sticky sweet with rum notes and just a hint of grassy hops the body is full and a bit oily light carbonation altogether my first problem is rating this as any kind of pilsner it just does not resemble any pilsner ive ever had it is more like an extra strength barleywine or maybe a boilermaker whatever it is it is drinkable and packs a pretty good punch for the price if thats what you are looking for this is for you
4794,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.75,i am not sure what i was thinking when i bought this beer upon reflection i feel like a teenage boy who is trying to get away with something and gets terribly embarrassed  anywayi poured this beer from a bottle into a tulip glass dark yellow essentially no head or lacing strong booze smell and taste sort of cheep whisky it does have some smokiness that does not make it a total loss and it is warming not a repeater
4795,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.25,boozy
4796,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.43,this beer is hilarious honestly not sure what this is looks like piss tastes like a heavy lager smells like bready malt and booze feels like a eastern bloc boot stomp yikes its decent but man the mixed reviews on this have me laughing my ass off
4797,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,1.15,as a homebrewer im familiar with the style very on par for a mr beer extract kit that the owner boosted with a sugary adjunct such as honey or way too much sugar tastes acrid sharp  bitter like most brews from this hovel of a brewery i tried their lobster lovers beer  it was identical drinks like what youd expect a soviet bloc country brewing adjunct beers  selling at craft prices to taste like the bottom shelf at my local gas station would all drink smoother than this slav piss
4798,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,1.71,500ml bottle poured out a clear golden amber color with a very small white head of foam it smelled of boozy sweet malt so much alcohol burn little bitterness
4799,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,5,here is a brew ive been cellaring for quite a while as i feared it would taste rancid based on reviews of this site let me tell you maybe the bad reviews are due to drinking this too fresh or in the wrong glass or the wrong temperature or improper storage i dont know but i am drinking a bottle right now that has aged gracefully for 14 years and reminds me of nothing more than jw lees barley wine the only thing missing is some time in the barrel  poured at about 44 degrees into a snifter this beer has an appearance of opaque orangish rustic brown with minimal head the aroma is of sweet hints of subtle wet cardboard and wet basement yet has some bourbon caramel vanilla fruity woodness mixed in the flavors are very much of the aroma with some hints of tobacco im telling you if i didnt see the bottle i would have thought it was a jw lee vintage for 3 this beer kicks ass it might just need to age and be stored properly this is for sure the best lithuanian beer i have ever had i give it a 5 because well i see nothing wrong with it and if i see it again ill be sure be buying it again think about it jw lees is 10 for 112 oz and this is 3 for 22oz
4800,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,3.23,rinku≈°kiai crazy brewski imperial pils 169 fl oz brown glass bottle coded l13021 299  roger wilco pennsauken nj  notes via stream of consciousness cool label im not sure what the santa hat is doing on a guy who looks kind of like the devil but ok and what is naturally fermented beer is there an unnatural way of fermenting beer i have not heard of that yet but i digress it pours a clear amberorange body beneath a short head of bright white that is fizzling away before my eyes at 15 alcohol though i guess that a little of that is expected ahhh wait although its clear not quite fingerprintthroughtheglass clear but clear the bottle says its partially filtered bottleconditioned and maybe thats what they mean by naturally fermented beer unfortunately partially filtered is not the same thing as bottleconditioned and i highly doubt youd get much additional carbonation at 14 alcohol unless you had a really tolerant yeast strain but ok here i go getting offtrack again back to the beer theres some higher alcohol and ethyl acetate in the aroma not good theres some adjunct laden and bready  caramelish malt as well but the nail polish aroma is distracting  big loss of points on that count of course to be honest i was kind of expecting that this isnt from russia its from lithuania but thats close enough and ive found a lot of the beers from the baltic region with higher gravities and alcohol contents suffer from hot and fast fermentations personally i believe that they actually like this over there but different strokes for different folks right at least it doesnt taste like antifreeze was added thats pretty much soley a russian thing moving forward and if you think i was kidding i wasnt the flavor reflects those higher alcohols and ethyl acetate as well its not the worst ive ever had but its still not good im only a couple of sips into this and im not sure i want to finish it i fear i might black out or maybe do something weird if i get drunk on it its malty though and at least i like that and its balanced by a lowlevel bitterness and the hot alcohol which equals a dry finish there are unfortunately no noticeable hops perhaps some leafy grassy and spicy undertones are there but thats it no this is more like the malt prior to distilling bourbon given that its flawed its hard to score it well but at the same time i have had worse so it is what it is and it gets what it gets mediumfull in body with a dextrinous side and a moderate soft carbonation that leaves it smooth and doesnt amplify the alcohol or heat thats there not the best by any means but certainly not undrinkable
4801,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,5,the look is that of a samuel adams boston lager the smell and taste is basically the same decent beer that has been sitting in a rusty bucket it even slightly stings the feel this is where this beer shines when you consider the alcohol content it is so light and easy to drink it has the alcohol of four beers and comes in 166oz bottles it doesnt taste like one of those iced beers its not thick it wont make you puke if you chug itwhich has happened to me with king cobra and natty daddy if you put a little thought and calculate the amount of alcohol in this drink the taste and feel are far better than anything else in the range i will definitely buy again
4802,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,1.06,this was so disgusting i didnt know how to describe it it pours decent but the smell is overwhelmingly terrible it wreaks of stale disgusting bourbon mixed with a even more stale and disgusting beer thats mixed with a stronger taste of alcohol than everclear just dont do it stay away from it
4803,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.57,this is an amber colored brewslim head and a medium clear complexion the aroma is boozy with an offputting caramel scent strong alcoholic sweet and illconceived its like a sweet alcoholic excuse for a beer not at all reminiscent of a pilsener disappointing
4804,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.3,i received a single bottle of this lithuanian imperial pils as a gift from a friend and didnt know what to expect ive found some eastern european beers to be surprisingly good poured from 169 oz bottle into pilsner glass it pours an orangebronze color with a very thin ecrucolored head it smells of sweet malt brown sugar caramel and dark fruit the smell is vaguely reminiscent of a barleywine the taste though is awful cloyingly sweet with astringent alcohol theres nothing subtle about this    and nothing good either its bereft of carbonation and the booziness is over the top this may be the least pleasant beer ive had dont let the look and smell fool you its simply dreadful stuff
4805,Double IPA,3.5,shared bottle at local tasting thanks to gunnar abv is 85 golden colour huge white head sweetish aroma of malts and orange marmalade distinctly hoppy flavour throughout very bitter finish maybe not very complex but good
4806,Double IPA,3.62,presentation 12 oz can served in a samuel adams pint glass  appearance one finger head that sticks around for a while and leaves some good lacing cloudy dark gold color  smell dank musky hop aroma some fresh citrus peel with faint malt and grain notes in the background  taste bitter but not overwhelmingly so it has more of a juicy fruity sweet citrus character which is nice a faint piney aftertaste remains  mouthfeel smooth and medium bodied with medium high carbonation  overall nothing new or groundbreaking here which is fine a solid dipa and a damn good beer
4807,Double IPA,4.45,theres a simultaneous malt  fruity kick on each sip the piney aftertaste is blatant and incredible yummy beer
4808,Double IPA,4.25,l hazy orange with a rocky white head mediumplus retention a thin film hangs out forever rings of lacing are left behind  s huge yellow grapefruit and tangerine aromas spraying oils juicy flesh and bitter pith some ripe mango and pineapple honey and caramel and massive pine sap and dankness  t orange creamsicle yellow grapefruit peel honey toasted white bread overripe mango pine resin finish moderately sweet although the finish grows crisp moderate lingering bitterness  f mediumplus wellcarbonated smooth creamy and wellrounded finishes slightly sticky and resinous but fairly clean for the style  o a superb example of west coast double ipa a delicious hoppy offering
4809,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.69,its an american macro adjunct lager looks like them all taste like rice its only advantage over the others is its more cool i like the nostalgia that comes from drinking this but not much else
4810,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),4.71,my go to everyday beer 19 for 30 cans great taste all around good beer
4811,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),5,i actually like it alot i am no conisiour but it is very good
4812,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.65,12 oz can poured straight from the fridge into a pilsner glass  pours a clear yellow gold with a quickly dissipating 1 finger sudsy white head leaving behind minimal lacing and a film of head  initial aroma is cereal grainy bready malt crisp and yeasty its the classic lager smell a little in the way of fruity yeasty esters after agitating im hit with a blast of yeast not quite funk but something in the vein of yogurt bacteria theres also a high amount of malt  initial taste before swallowing is malty sweet almost fruity after swallowing im met with a large dose of grain and malt flavors a little tasteless but the taste that is there is good relatively high sweetness throughout the whole process  mouthfeel is honestly better than i would expect from a 48 its not spectacular but its not really thin either carbonation is overall mediocre but definitely adds a lot it fades quickly but rejuvenates impressively upon agitating  overall i totally understand why this is revered as a good cheap beer like listen its not a great beer but its already not bad and for 1 a can it becomes better i realize thats not the healthiest way to measure the worth of something especially alcohol but im not buying in large amounts it excels for the adjunct lager style while being inoffensive and extremely easy to drink if nothing else  definitely will purchase again at some point in the future likely in 6 pack format and will recommend as a good cheap beer will not purchase often but still
4813,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.16,16oz can date stamp on can bottom is oct2323 for best by consumption clear pale gold colored body thin white small bubble head this head is constantly replenished by rising bubbles left behind are some scattered spots of lacing aroma of grain and corn malts very doughy has a little floral and earthy hops taste is malt laden  grain and corn which is slightly sweet floral and fruity hops quick end to the aftertaste touch of sulfur slightly thin for mouth feel but this might have something to do with the rapid exit of flavors after each sip or quaff smooth and crisp finish very good carbonation wet and simple profile poundable does not get in the way of bar activities
4814,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.84,light clear golden color great for hot weather when youre eating and dont want anything to distract from the flavor or when youre doing something that youre not thinking about the beer itself like watching sports definitely not a craft beer nothing exciting or interesting about it but it is not bad for what it is which is a cheap macrobrew think of it as a palate cleanser when you get tired of all the high flavor microbrews and then youll be fine with it
4815,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),4.46,this is a great beer cold or warm goes down easy and doesnt have much of a head its great to have when ya wanna drink a lot of beer good for taking to the river or beach
4816,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),4.27,for a cheap beer it tastes quite good
4817,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3,a beer enjoyed by both manly men and girly men hipsters alike i first remember seeing hipsters drinking this beer for 150 a bottle at my favorite dive bar back in 2005 then by 2011 there must have been an article about it in hipster monthly magazine because fedoras began to tip by the millions nationwide for pbr the beer tastes okay and its in the 11 dollar range for a 12pk which is the new cheap for beer it is the gold standard for a 3 out of 5 beer  style american lager  tapcanbottle can  abv 48  rating 3
4818,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),5,og beer gets the job done
4819,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.26,poured into an 8ounce 1940s era stange which is probably one of the only types of glasses that can keep a head on this lightbodied beer the head stayed and left lacing as i drank it the beer has a pronounced aroma of grain and hops the taste is better than expected and remembered with a slightly bitter aftertaste for the style it is very good and i do not understand the poor rating
4820,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.36,when you value quantity over quality this is your beer
4821,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.24,this is the most okay beer not unpleasant not good you could drink it but most craft beers are better
4822,KBS,4.77,looks beautiful tan creamy head over dark brown beer smell coffee bourbon alcohol just a little subdued taste this is not subtle sweet without being sugary bourbon coffee chocolate and some alcohol more balanced than something like dragons milk that is a little too sugary feel thick and just a little effervescent overall yum my favorite stout i think
4823,KBS,4.22,not much left to say the barrel flavors are there and theyre not vaguely barrellike oh and its not a sugar bomb the feel is what stands out the most creamy full and slightly alcoholic at the end fantastic
4824,KBS,4.88,this is one of my favorite beers i have ever had it has become my standard to compare other stouts but nothing has compared to founders so far my only complaint is that there seems to be slight differences in taste and feel from batch to batch however there is a good chance that its just a misperception on my part i have always enjoyed every single one this one is pretty pricey but its worth it 100
4825,KBS,4.98,really good stout rivals dragons milk which is my favorite readily available stout dragons milk has a little bit of a sweet note that i dont love and i didnt detect that with kbs i do think kbs has a stronger alcohol taste but i only noticed it on the first couple drinks very easy to drink beer for being 12 abv
4826,KBS,5,not for all but all must try dark chocolate and coffee fun welcome
4827,KBS,3.84,kbs always pours great deep dark black and smells really great if you like bourbon the mouth feel is a medium body with that bourbon smell turning into a subtle taste becomes more dark chocolate bitter forward as you drink it the fresher the beer the more bite the bourbon taste has
4828,KBS,4.64,super good but not as good as the toppling goliath 
4829,KBS,4.35,bottled on 13123  poured at fridge temp into a tulip glass  pours jetmotoroilblack with a rich and creamy 15 finger mocha colored head 425  sweet and boozy bourbon vanilla and notes coming off the bottle pour in the glass gives the same coffee peeks out as well though lightly as it warms up bumping this up two notches because it gets richer and sweeter as it warms up 475  bourbon and boozy forward fairly bitter coffee followed by some earthy chocolate and touch of hops 425  very warming slight boozy burn silky smooth with some light carbo bite 4  overall a nice sipper that makes full and excellent use of the bourbon aroma and taste are quite delightful and well crafted 425

4834,Darkstar November,4.85,bourbon and rum very heavy in taste body and on the nose it hides the high abv exceptionally well almost like a distilled dark red or port the feel suffers a little but the smell and taste are unreal
4835,Superior,3.78,drank 010623 in the southern yucat√°n mexico really hit the spot and despite being a mass produced corn lager is really smooth no hop presence whatsoever but thin thirst quenching when cold extremely tasty when warm and just a good cheap lager
4836,Superior,3.47,300ml bottle bbd oct 2022 poured into a vintage bow tie glass at fridge temp 46 abv the beer pours bright light gold in color with nearly white head the head recedes to a pencil thin ring and island the aroma is slight with a hint of malt the taste is semisweet corny slightly tangy malt with a side of vague vegetable and negligible bitterness the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish diacetyl is present to a noticeable degree overall fair aal
4837,Superior,2,a generic mexican lager
4838,Superior,2.99,poured from the 300ml bellita bottle which is in fact the same beer as regular bottled superior this bottle also says its 46 not 36 maybe the 36 is alcohol by weight  the look is like any other adjunct lager has a light head that fizzles down over a few minutes into a few clusters of floating bubbles very light not a lot else going on here average carbonation crystal clear  the smell is very vague with a sweetness and hint of hops but nothing that really stands out  the taste is similar to the smell but with a stong corn flavor no bitterness basically just corn with lager flavor but easy to put down and nothing necessarily offensive would be better if it was colder right at the front there is a mineral flavor that isnt the best but doesnt really get in the way pretty boring  feel is denser than you might expect but still could be a beach beer but not the best work beer maybe good for drinking on a summer night ice cold but it better be cold quite sticky as it warms  overall its a cheap mexican lager with a bit too much corn wish it had a bit more gops to balance it out i suppose balance is the main thing it lacks all it there is here is corn flavor and id appreciate it if there was something more but if you find it for cheap in the full size i would still give it a try
4839,Superior,3.03,clean light adjunct lager beer in taste and appearance very comparable to amstel light so happens to be another product in the heineken portfolio for what it is albeit remove the import price here in the us and also the small 1014 fl oz bottles the beer itself is a good product ymmv
4840,Superior,3.5,not bad  its similar to victoria  i drank 6 10oz bottles with no complaints  it is what it is  this aint no beer for pouring in a glass and pondering nuances
4841,Superior,2.29,i mean mexican beer is pretty bad right out the gate this stuff takes it to the next level below i actually like drinking a modelo from time to time not bad in terms of light beer so i tried this one thinking hey its probably like a modelo it was cheap 250 tall boy so what could what could go wrong pours a golden color with a decent fizzy head nothing on the aroma side but you probably already assumed that the taste is more soapy seltzer than beer  honestly this stuff doesnt taste like any kind of lager i can think of except maybe michelob ultra which is a whole other story check it out if you dig mexican lagers otherwise grab a modelo and some hot cheetos
4842,Superior,3.3,24 oz can from plaid pantry 46 alc now clear corn oil coloured body head is actually quite impressive huge billowyrocky white aroma paper and wet hay taste more of the paper and hay and some white bread not as bad as the aroma suggested mouth feel is thin well carbonated not the worst mexican lager
4843,Superior,3.1,clear pale gold with three fingers of white head splotches of lace are forming as the levels drop smell is corny and sweet taste is sweet corny and just a pinch of spicy hops mouthfeel is light and well carbonated the finish is mildly dry and mostly sweet overall a nice enough cervesa best by date is sept 2021
4844,Superior,2.81,clear yellow colored beer with a wisp of a white colored head   smells sweet and fairly corny toasted grain scent faint noel hop scent mostly it is grassy  starts out neutral mildly sweet and tasting of mineral water mild bitterness no real hop presence bland  mouthfeel is watery  overall just a beer sees no reason to ever try it again
4845,Superior,2.87,look crystal clear pale yellow with a billowing white head that slowly craters to a lid leaving behind great lacing aroma light wafts of pilsner malt crackerlike malt floral hops and cereal grains taste sweet malt and grains come on strong followed by some light but welcome floral notes honestly this didnt seem like it would be this sweet from what i read from the nose as that fades a little corn comes in and finishes with more grains mouthfeel light but fairly full a little cloying from the sweetness somewhat clean and crisp but the sweetness definitely takes from that overall ehh this isnt terrible but its far from good as that sweetness really detracts from what i assume is coming with a cerveza  crisp clean and light id never heard of nor seen this beer so had to try it and at 29924oz can it wasnt an expensive gamble but id grab a modelo bohemia victoria or tecate every single time over this
4846,Superior,3.2,appearance clear lightly yellow goldenish smell not too noticeable thin corn i guess like a beer though taste aint too bad really has almost a touch of a sorta simmering sweetness in it ok on the feel overall its a nice easy simple beer to just take a moment or 2 and enjoy dribble a real small salt splash to it though btw the can i drained it from sez 46 alcvol mucho better that 36 si
4847,Champale Golden,1.25,what made the company change  golden champale from the green bottles to the clear bottles that was the worst thing you could have done i was a loyal champale drinker the clear bottles dont have the quality that the green bottles presented i know others that have stop drinking it also the clear bottles  taste like sugar water what a let down so i am contacting you wondering is it possible to order the golden champale original  in the green bottles you should really consider  putting them in the green bottles i know for some reason the color of those bottles make a difference take a survey among your champale drinkers and see what you come up with 
4848,Champale Golden,3.72,24 ounce bottle into lager glass bottled on 7232018 pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a foamy soda off white head with poor retention that reduces to a nothing very quickly no glass lacing fair amount of streaming carbonation and clinging bubbles on the glass okay appearance aromas of white grape juice roses wine cracker corn white bread white sugar and light herbalgrassy hops nice aromas with good balance of grapeswine flavors pale malt sugar and slight herbal hop notes with good strength taste of big white grape juice roses wine cracker corn white bread white sugar and light herbalgrassy hops mild herbalgrassy bitterness and grape tangtartness on the finish lingering notes of white grape juice roses wine cracker corn white bread white sugar and light herbalgrassy hop notes of the finish for a good bit very nice robustness and balance of grapeswine flavors pale malt sugar and slight herbal hop flavors with a solid maltbittertartness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish very crispclean finishing lightmoderate increasing dryness from lingering bittertartness and carbonation high carbonation and lightmedium body with a very smooth fairly grainy and lightly syrupyacidictangy balanced mouthfeel that is great minimal warming alcohol for 54 overall this is a very tasty flavored malt liquor all around nice robustness and balance of grapeswine flavors pale malt sugar and slight herbal hop flavors very smooth crisp clean and refreshing to drink very flavorful and not watery for the abv not overly sweet from crisp carbonated dryness tastes like a wine cooler more than a malt liquor but i rate on enjoyment for weird stuff like this they did really well for whatever they were going for on the champagnelike flavor profile a very enjoyable offering
4849,Champale Golden,1.5,something that should have never existed though i guess there is a limited marked tried it in fancy bottles in indianapolis once beer should be beer flavored period
4850,Champale Golden,3.1,finding this was the brightest bright spot in my recent hellish roadtrip to savannah ga been looking for it for years ever since i was little and my uncle would regale me with tails of a mystical beverage marketed to the very poor that was part malt liquor and part champagne  i was expecting something awfulalong the lines of the mythical meister brau which i still havent foundis surprisingly pretty okay not just a regular malternativeyou can pick up definite nodes of champagne yeast along with big nodes of artificial grape flavoring that taste not like dimetapp but like actual grape only artificial
4851,Champale Golden,3,i originally entered champale golden and pink champale on beeradvocate years ago and the bros turned it down saying something like no way dude because id mentioned it was flavored with grape i think i said something in my review that offended them along the lines of historically it was the first malternative but the truth remains that it was and still is  if you can find it its production is limited now  champale malt liquor starting with dry champale in 1939 was in fact advertised as a flavored malt beverage back in the 60s  more importantly my review also gave a quick history of the brew noting that it was brewed in trenton nj and that it helped save brewing in the area by allowing other dying brands to stay alive additionally it was marketed directly to african americans as a poor mans champagne which was somewhat unusual at the time and still retains a high level of interest  so whats it like golden clear highly carbonated fruity and sweet with notes of grape thats about it i wouldnt call it balanced but i really wouldnt call it cloying either its an interesting and unusual beer that also has a lot of history behind it if you can find it you should try it just to see what its all about
4852,Champale Golden,2.4,unearthed from a dank cooler in a rundown liquor store in wood river il outside of st louis celebrate tonight with champale a finely brewed and unique flavored malt beverage in a class of its own clear 24 oz bottle neck stamped 120610  into a large mug it sizzles with lively carbonation but not really enough to emulate champagne anemic pale gold color with a finger of white foam that rapidly fades to a thin ring around the sides  smells like 7up and white grape juice definitely artificially sweetened tastes and feels very similar to 7up fake lemon lime sweet bubbly astringent theres a undercurrent of swill in the aftertaste along with a chalky smarties candy sweetness im getting flashbacks to college briefly experimenting with tequiza mikes and similar artificially fruity alcopops doesnt really come across as a malt liquor with all the sweetener and flavoring dumped in four loko and the like have gotta be edging champale off the market
4853,Achel Trappist Extra,4.1,750ml bottle into a tulip best by october 2020 so a bit late will it matter spoiler alert it didnt  looks great dark reddish brown body with a persistent off white head the nose promises bags of dark fruit but the taste doesnt quite deliver very smooth and certainly enjoyable
4854,Achel Trappist Extra,5,bottling date still fairly fresh as cellar ales go autumn 2022 i believe an uneventful pry of the cap am greeted with welcoming sweet bready bakery smells pour into globular 15 cl snifter issues a bubbly pinkyfinger tan cap which recedes rather quickly but lingers with a dormantbutgurgling surface activity and the obligatorily persistent flank of dense microbubbles surrounding the fill line color an enchanting semitranslucent rubybrown with no noticeable particles having a swim nose after pour validates those first impressions of the newlyopened bottle  bready yeasts raisins a certain dankness other complexities that i dont wish to overstudy into the mouth feels rather effervescent telegraphing those firstperceived scents to the palate maybe a slightly bitter and sour character is ascertained for nuanced complexity and balancesynergy this delivers swallow brings it on home smoothly tangy delicious as it descends  in summary i dont know if i could even tell this apart from a revered ol st b 12 or eek a westie if conducting a blind comparison which hey that gives me an idea
4855,Achel Trappist Extra,4.5,rerate 750 ml green bottle as trappist achel bruin bier extra probably from vinmonopolet brown colour huge offwhite to beige head vinous aroma notes of dark dried fruits brown kandij sugar oak old dry sherry oaky and medium sweet flavour with a dry finish again notes of dried figs brown kandij sugar and old and medium dry sherry a hoppy and oaky bite in the finish  original rating bottle at den tatoverede enke copenhagen brown colour vinous and oaky aroma and flavour of old dry sherry even cognac  armagnac a top notch beer
4856,Achel Trappist Extra,4.66,dark brown with some red not too much foam lots of raisins and figs vanilla sweet aroma tastes reasonably sweet with flavors following the nose some creamy thick mouthfeel though drinks smoothly extremely pleasant  lovely quad im treating this as a quad if you want to open the bjcp pandoras box and belgian dark strong ale vs quad discussion it certainly does not have to hide itself against the likes of st bernardus  rochefort  westvleteren though misses their complexity by a tiny bit
4857,Achel Trappist Extra,4.5,poured from 750ml bottle into chimay goblet  l  dark golden brown pour sandy taupe head which dissipates quickly  s  malt slight metallic note buttery brown bread  t  syrupy treacle sweetness dark bready grains sweetness is cut by a vegetal fennel bitterness  f  not over thin fine carbonation with a dry finish  an excellent example of the style do wish the taste was a slightly better match to the smell
4858,Achel Trappist Extra,4.6,actually thought this was their tripel so i was was surprised by the dark brown pour  very creamy tan head with a nicely fuzzy persistence its almost like a quad but not as sweet and thick  has a fluffy carbonation and a lot of quadlike elements of spice and fruit but dried out and toned down to something almost umami theres some wood and bitter char and smoke amid the dates and dark fruited bread impressions lots of complexity and depth smooth and dangerously drinkable  this 750 ml bottle isnt going to last long  very impressed  highly recommended for fans of quads strong belgian darks belgian and fine ales in general  as well as all true bas  trappist monks this is how you do this
4859,Achel Trappist Extra,4.6,look it pours dark brown with a tan head head retention is very good it is clear for the most part  smell strong rich malty aroma with raisins there are some dried cherry notes a very low spice and and very light vanilla  taste it is malty rich with bread and raisin flavors there are dried cherries at moderate levels with a light spice and perfume  feel it has a full body and is quite dry in the finish there is alcohol warming at pleasant levels  overall a great blend of flavors and aromas
4860,Achel Trappist Extra,4.28,750ml bottle no dating found green bottle imported by shelton bros body color is a plum brown with cloudiness minimal head no lacing aroma is dark fruit raisin molasses dark bread and candi sugar taste is dark fruit raisin prune and fig chocolate and vanilla molasses and toffee the dark fruit rules supreme in the aftertaste but expresses slightly sweet heavier mouth feel with some syrup very little carbonation from this bottle beguiling beer that tastes rich and dense with flavors i bought this at a bottle shop that stocks very few belgian beers so it would be helpful to know the age of the beer considering the lack of carbonation
4861,60 Minute IPA,3.97,a great drinking ipa
4862,60 Minute IPA,4.39,pours a bright near clear orange golden with a finger and a half of foamy white head nose is a bright explosion of citrus hops floral piney notes with a tiny hint of weedy dankness taste follows with citrus  orange sweet grapefruit  almost juicy but with floral notes piney resin and a really nice soft bitterness balancing a cereal malt sweetness exceptionally balanced medium mouthfeel  so smooth  gulpable  with a bittersweet finish historically great and still great
4863,60 Minute IPA,4,i tried this beer a very long time ago as well as the 90 minute imperial ipa for some reason the brewmaster at dogfish head thinks their ipas need to be more and more malty the 90 minute used to taste hoppy and now it tastes completely malty and toasted now the 60 minute version is ruined cant figure out why these beers started out very hoppy but are now malt dominant the brewmaster is an idiot in my opinion these beers arent horrible but they are not at all what they once were the bm can go screw himself in my opinion he must not like hops or something stupid like that screw him
4864,60 Minute IPA,3,its a good ipa but not a great one i dont particularly like ipas but i can recognize quality in the style even if i dont enjoy it this one is good possibly very good for how widely available it is but its not a memorable one
4865,60 Minute IPA,5,from an idiot beer drinker with no expertise at all this is the perfect ipa exactly what i want when i want an ipa
4866,60 Minute IPA,3.43,ive been a big fan of this beer since it was first produced but the last two times i tried it on tap at different bars i was very disappointed it had a pronounced malt taste but without the hoppy edge that made it great so i ordered other ipas that i always thought were good competition to the 60min and they didnt disappoint i hate to see the change in 60min as i wont buy it the was it is id like to know if any of you also experienced what i have
4867,60 Minute IPA,4.17,a smooth drink showing light amber color a complex taste with moderate bitterness
4868,60 Minute IPA,4.65,no need to break this down this gets a high score from everyone including me myself for a reason yup its that good my favorite ipa by a long shot its the perfect balance of what we want in a ipa if youre a lush like l am it is perfect summertime crusher with a relatively low 6 abv one of my top 5
4869,Oktoberfest M√§rzen Lager,4.34,like a lot of lagers this style doesnt get the high numbers im always way over rdev and could go even higher with this very enjoyable american m√§rzen 4th can on 4 separate days and thoroughly enjoyed them all
4870,Oktoberfest M√§rzen Lager,3.83,16oz can dated 8123  pours clear copper with a chillhaze and a halfinch head of white moderate retention and lacing biscuity malt in the nose with a hint of honeydrizzled brown bread medium bodied with a soft but crisp mouthfeel doughy malt on the palate with a substantial bitterness and a minerally backbone finishes dry and bitter with a dirty penny aftertaste
4871,Oktoberfest M√§rzen Lager,3.99,poured from a can into a pint glass appearance  the beer pours a deep amber color with a small head of offwhite foam the head has a decent level of retention fading to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass smell  the aroma is heavy of a caramel and bready smell with light notes of toast and dough mixed with these smells comes notes of apple and pear as well as a touch of earth and some floral hop taste  the taste begins with a rather clean brady and doughy flavor mixed with some caramel and toffee sweetness at the same time there is a touch of nuttiness and a little bit of apple and pear as the taste advances the flavors take on a touch more roastiness and graininess while the sweet and doughy flavors dwindle a tad at the end herb and earth join in leaving one with a slightly more crisp for a marzen and rather clean taste to linger on the tongue mouthfeel the body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a rather moderate carbonation level bot of which suit the flavor profile rather well and both of which make for a very easy sipper overall  a rather nice flavorful and super easy drinking marzen quite nice
4872,Oktoberfest M√§rzen Lager,3.84,canned on 8123  tall can pours a welcoming and warm shad of medium honey amber medium haze large and lasting khaki cap leaves heavier strands of sticky lacing on the glass  malty sniff leads to some vanilla honey and maple on the palatepleasing o festmarzen brew
4873,Oktoberfest M√§rzen Lager,4,poured into a 16 oz pint glass from a can born on 61523 pours light reddish brown with initial two fingers of head slowly but surely recedes tastes of sweet caramel notes and slightly burnt malt good
4874,Oktoberfest M√§rzen Lager,4.08,this brew boasts an attactive orange color and a slight white head there are sweet and toasty malt notes in the nose its mediumbodied and low in carbonation palate is on the sweet side with the subtlest european hop notes in the finish some hop appears in the nose as the beer warms straightforward but good
4875,Oktoberfest M√§rzen Lager,4.08,canned 82522  i was listening to malt couture ddbs podcast 2 weeks ago and this beer was featured everyone on the pod seemed to think it was pretty good so i made a mental note to grab it if i saw it lo and behold i found it a few days later by total accident lets crack this open for the crisp fall night were having  pours a cloudy brownish orange with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  in the nose this kinda leans a bit more into festbier territory it gives it a nice pop im picking up on aromas of biscuity malt herbal hops wildflower honey cracker black pepper and light orange zest  it leans a bit sweeter in taste but its still very solid on the front end of the sip im tasting wheat bread toasted grain floral hops pear sweet honey and light pepper the swallow brings notes of biscuity malt wildflower honey pear skin floral hops light toast and toffee  a light medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a crisp beer with a nice sweetness finishes dry and very refreshing  this is solid stuff highly drinkable and not too sweet like some can be
4876,Oktoberfest M√§rzen Lager,3.65,pours an opaque translucent brown with a small head that sticks around slight aroma of malt a little sour on the taste than other local marzens little bit of maltiness and some bitterness on the end medium body
4877,Oktoberfest M√§rzen Lager,3.74,from a 16oz can dated 072522 served in a willi becher pub glass  pours a crystalline caramelcopper with twoplus fingers of rocky suds retention is good leaving robust streaks of foamy lacing colourwise its sort of midway between what id expect a m√§rzen and a festbier to look like  nose is breadymalty and somewhat reminiscent of a caramel apple  taste has more of a sharp earthy bite to it than what id smelled tasting brown bread and apple caramel nuts tea and tobacco there may be a subtle slightly sweet pine needley aftertaste thats hard to account for but only mildly discordant and really more of a curiosity than anything else  feel is smooth and slick somewhat full bodied relative to the style with fine tingly carbonation a little more carbonation would have been welcome considering its heft  overall a credible oktoberfestbier a somewhat americanized take on the style  despite the claim of being brewed with all german ingredients  but not outrageously so its probably a little too thick if it were my intention to drink all four cans in one sitting not that thats ever really my intention it just sort of seems to happen
4878,Upper Case,4.9,176 yummy
4879,Upper Case,4.44,my first trillium a surprise keg at the kinderhill brewery got the last pour  thick rich hazy yellow with a creamy beige head and great curtain lacing strong distinctive tropical fruit smell and taste pineapple mangoorange grapefruit some basil herbal flavor nice hoppiness fresh with a bit of burn silky smooth feel really nice beer
4880,Upper Case,4.72,very smooth  9
4881,Carlton Cold,2.01,looks like beer smells and tastes like urine with a metallic taint to set your teeth on edge in the worst rated list on ba and its place is well deserved horrible no longer abv 49 but reconfigured a few years ago into a 35 mid strength i never tried the heavy version which a few members rate moderately
4882,Carlton Cold,2.23,september 2008 375 ml clear bottle courtesy of cardinal pub  bar stavanger abv is 46 crystal clear pale golden colour fizzy with a big to moderate lasting white head moderate fruity aroma notes of candy and citrus zesty mouthfeel the flavour is moderately sweet with some fruity notes minimal hops bland finish not much to write home about here far from undrinkable though
4883,Carlton Cold,1.02,i recently reviewed victoria bitter which i drank for old times sake by chance and it reminded me of one of the other beers i drank whilst in australia carlton cold  i wanted to review this beer because unlike vb which i liked at the time but recently gave a very poor review this beer i disliked even at the time so i wanted to see if it really is as bad as i remember  my friend recently went to australia so i asked him ton grab me a bottle so i could review it  poured most of a 355ml bottle into a 350ml beer glass  poured a pale watery yellow with a very loose low head that disappeared almost immediately no lacing  nose was extremely disappointing a faint hoppy aroma some other faint but unidentifiable aromas maybe chemical horrible  palate much the same as the nose faintly hoppy and watery no complexity or malt horrible probably worse than the nose  mouth was watery with very loose medium to heavy artificial carbonation horrible  overall probably even worse than i remember an almost unbelievably woeful attempt at brewing beer breweries that churn out abominations like this shouldnt be allowed to call it lager or beer it should perhaps be called carlton cold  adjunct grain derivative  absolutely horrible highly unrecommended
4884,Carlton Cold,2.95,carlton cold is filtered below zero degrees celsius creating a full flavoured fresh taste the mid strength beer has subtle bitterness with a crisp dry finish providing an easy drinking experience
4885,Carlton Cold,1.62,format a standard clear 355ml bottle with that old carlton cold macro label i get the feeling that cub has dropped cold from being a full strength to a mid at 35 as this bottle is when they started their big advertising campaign a year or so ago i used to drink cold at barbeques because i was a poor student lets revisit it at 35 and see if it is any good  appearance poured out a light yellow in colour with a continual swirling cascade of carbonation even with a fairly generous pour very little head pops up  just a light white cap and ring  aroma this has a smell i got so close to try and smell it that i accidentally snorted some which was both embarrassing and a bit of a mistake once it was clinging to my nose and possibly my brain i got wet cardboard and some cheap grains great  taste a pretty damn awful cheap grain and corn adjunct dominates what little flavour this thing has one of the rare few beers that actually makes me pull a weird face  aftertaste drops away quickly with just a touch of sweetness coming through from the grain  mouth feel light and watery in body with a mouthfilling carbonation not great  overall for the sake of my many barbeque memories i will assume that the carton cold that i used to drink 10 years ago the full strength 49 was less bad than this 35 that you get now this beer manages somehow to be both boring and taste bad most of it was donated to the gods of the sink its only au40 a case but seriously just drink water or something it certainly tastes better
4886,Carlton Cold,2.1,just a typical aussie macro lager whilst the taste is not offensive and thankfully lacks the coin flavour that many others feature it is just so plain and unimaginative that i couldnt commend it in any way other that to say it does not make me recoil basically water with a slight generic beer taste ok for a knockoff beer after grafting on a stinking hot day
4887,Carlton Cold,1.12,honestly and without hesitation i can say that i used to love this beer when it was considered a heavy in the older style bottle and before the 5m relaunch it had the crisp yet satisfying appeal but now that carlton have sucked the the living essence out the first beer i ever tried i will never be buying it again  all i can say is good job to the dickhead who thought that that was a good idea
4888,Carlton Cold,1.28,this beers is crap when i open there is minimal fizz from the low carbonation in the beer its self the aroma that comes out when first opened is putrid my fat chicks girlfriends shit smells and tastes and better than this and trust me i would know give me a vb any day that shit is fucking holy water even better taken as a suppository
4889,Carlton Cold,1.57,this is the second of three australian beers my store has brought in and is surprisingly the most expensive one despite on here anyway looking like the worst i had to go for it though my store to make any sort of decent margin sells this catastrophe for 4 canadian dollars per small 330ml bottle making it by far the biggest rip off in the entire store nobody even gave it a chance as a 21 6pack i digress though  the beer honestly looks pretty nice  it as a slightly darker shade of yellow than most adjunct lagers and has a coppery colour to it that makes it resemble almost exactly the bottle of maple whiskey that is sitting on my table not bad on that front  the smell is also not bad its got the standard adjunct smell but it has some kind of deep fruity smell that makes smelling it almost interesting and is not offensive especially considering the beer vatriety smells good looks good what could go wrong  well after the first sip i very well knew what went wrong the taste of this beer is just bad bad bad its a corny burst on the tongue with an explosion no joke it felt that way of sour aftertaste going down the beer felt like straw it was rough a term i dont even use much for heavy beers but that is what was going on 1s for taste and feel for sure  i cant even finish more than 5cm of the glass it is just that putrid do not want
4890,Double Nelson,4.37,look  slight haze orangish yellow with slight white head nice rimming smell and taste  crisp grainy earthy citrus with a slight tropical complex and a lot there feel  light crispness overall  pretty nice
4891,Double Nelson,4.7,this beer is distinctive in its hop character and taste bittersweet almost earthy but extremely drinkable it has a quality that most beers dont have a sense of place a truly unique beer and that is what makes it exceptional
4892,Double Nelson,4.54,a  pours a hazy golden orange with a large fluffy white head heavy amount of soapy lacing  s  aroma is mango tangerine white grapes and floral hops  t  the taste is tangerine mango apricot white grape honey and finishing with a grassy bitter hop bite  m  medium body with medium carbonation creamy mouthfeel with a soft dry finish  o  top notch neipa
4893,Double Nelson,4.5,sweet tropical hoppy slightly malty white wine grape and a hint of nelsondank nose on this one taste follows with a maltysweet nelson hoppy bitter finish east coast vibes on this allnelson dipa the maltiness is present but you still get some pretty good nelson hop expression additionally this feels nice and soft on the palatefantastic
4894,Double Nelson,4.9,162 great stuff
4895,Trappist Dubbel,4.26,poured beautifully into a chalice glass almost a dark purple hue bubbly and notable for the little subterranean pearls of yeast floating away merrily under a short but effervescent head notes of alcohol soaked plum and raisin taste is similar with phenolic sharpness and molasses dark rich sweetness surprisingly dry and crisp finish great dubbel
4896,Trappist Dubbel,4.37,330ml bottle  pours a deep brown with 2 finger foamy tan head with decent retention on the nose theres a lot going on hints of bready malt dark fruits dried fruits and spice tastewise its just as complex as it is on the nose flavours of dark  dried fruit are intensified balanced by a nice spice and a touch of caramel lovely mouthfeel with good carbonation truly outstanding dubbel
4897,Trappist Dubbel,4.07,under a level head of tan foam is a clear body of brown and red hues that emulate purple under light  the nigh impenetrably frothy head finally gives way to toasted pumpernickel with heavy phenols and a little bitter booze before finishing dry  though at the far more casual even grungy caf√© leffe in brussels i just love how every bar we go to no matter how shitty they might seem like they could be from the outside serves every beer properly and even recycles their bottles back to the producer but man these beautifully massive glasses make it seem like you have so much more beer in front of you than you actually do
4898,Trappist Dubbel,4.34,look pours a reddishbrown and a sudsy head quickly forms and noisily recedes leaving minimal lacing behind aroma plums apple skins dried figs candi sugar warm brown bread raisins light toffee concord grapes yeast and some earthy notes taste light fruity esters led by apple dance quickly on the palate before being hit with a huge wave of malt flavors toffee melanoidin piloncillo bread toasted crust and candi sugar all in play alongside the emergence of dark fruit that swirls in and out of the picture light earthy notes appear here and there and closes with malt sweetness fruity esters and dark fruit mouthfeel full smooth clean mediumhigh carbonation and soft and smooth on the finish overall this is delicious stuff this is a really tasty and wellmade dubbel with great depth of flavors and aromas evident throughout not too sweet not too fruity everything is in harmony as it all comes together to form a beer that is greater than the sum of its parts recommended
4899,Trappist Dubbel,4,poured a 330ml bottle into a pint glass a one finger bubbly white head on a cloudy brown good head retention some patchy lacing spicy yeast in the nose cinnamon nutmeg a mild hop finish medium body and carbonation a fine dubbel a bit drier than most
4900,Trappist Dubbel,4.4,halfway thru the initial pour i had already given it a 5 for the appearance beautiful large off white head over a cloudy mahogany colored body yeasty dried fruit lightly spiced aroma complex mouthfeel added to the enjoyment with tastes that incorporated spices a range of dark fruits some sourness some bitterness and some tartness a dubbel done right
4901,Trappist Dubbel,4.59,pours opaque dark brown in color with one inch head taste is dark bread and raisin light body moderate carbonation sweet it is a classic for good reason while i prefer other dubbels this one certainly delivers excellent beer
4902,Taddy Porter,4.06,poured from a 12oz bottle undated into a pint glass  appearance very dark brown with a large tan head that only gradually reduced but still left a portion and plenty of lacing  nose roasted malt sweet raisin maybe a bit of brown sugar  mouthfeel medium thick smooth adequate carbonation  attack follows the nose pretty closely very gentle just the slightest hint of spice  finish a bit of bitterness from the hops and dark roast just to balance  overall this is an extremely drinkable brew and would pair well with any meat the gentleness of this and other english porters is a nice occasional change from the sometimes more fullflavored but also more bitter american porters which i also love im enjoying it
4903,Taddy Porter,4.06,pours a nice dark black colour with a thin head when all is settled nose to me is hard water about it taste is roasty but not overly finishes slightly bitter some cocoa notes also on finish
4904,Taddy Porter,3.95,pours a dark brownish color with a half finger of head the nose has some mild roasty notes but thats about it the flavor has some modest roasted bitterness accompanied by a touch of molasses and smoke that said the lack of heartiness somewhat drags the whole flavor profile down
4905,Taddy Porter,4.55,from a bottle black with a half inch of fluffy brown head nutty roasted malt aroma medium body nutty roasted malt with a lasting earthy bitterness excellent
4906,Taddy Porter,4.57,this is a really nice brew very relaxed buzz and drinkable i dont think i can justify buying this one over something similar like maduro brown ale or newcastle and although i found this beer in a 4 pack but at the price of a craft sixer i cant hold that against it because it is very good  if you like a stout beverage this one is worth trying or if you just want something a bit classy and sophisticated
4907,Taddy Porter,4.17,550ml bottle l very dark brown almost black with a thick and creamy mochacoloured head and sheets of lacing s rich and toasty becomes more fruity as it warms t milky coffee cocoa dried figs some charring nicely dry rather than outright bitter f mediumlight body foaming carbonation velvet soft mouthfeel o a classic porter in the traditional style lovely stuff
4908,Taddy Porter,5,fantastic world class pricey but worth it i guess i have to add more words to make it submit as a review odd rule by the beer advocate web master
4909,Taddy Porter,4.26,appearance pours a jet black with a offwhite foam head decent retention  aroma very aromatic clean crisp toffee raisins and dark fruit  taste sweet malts chocolate raisins dark fruit a little bit of caramel with a clean finish  overall wow quite refreshing the aroma gives me an instant rush of crisp freshness that i havent had in many beers the taste follows this is an amazing porter
4910,KBS - Blueberry,3.99,pours a beautiful dark chocolate with a two finger head aroma is deeply bourbon chocolate and blueberry taste is less complex with blueberry first then bourbon chocolate follows at the end still one of the better blueberry brews out there
4911,KBS - Blueberry,4.5,pours jet black with a 1 12 finger tan head with retention and lacing nice aroma with chocolate coffee blueberries oak bourbon vanilla and cocoa the taste matches the aroma perfectly has a sweet chocolate and charred malt aftertaste for balance the blueberry has some sweetness up front and finishes a little bitter which also shows some nice balance medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation the aftertaste is more sweet than bitter a nice combination of flavors and a nice beer
4912,KBS - Blueberry,2.63,appearance  the beer was silky black with a tan head  smell  the nose smelled of underripe blueberries corrupting a once great stout  taste  underripe sour blueberries led the way what once made kbs great now tastes like sour i never imagined kbs and sour patch kids would be a good idea it even lingered sour in the back of my throat  mouthfeel  the body seemed thinner than regular kbs  overall  founders please stop doing horrible things to kbs

4914,KBS - Blueberry,4.68,brief review  o and the kbs variants keep rolling we follow up the cherry chocolate with another fruitforward one this one nails it the blueberry is almost perfectly integrated sweetness accentuates the chocolate and barrel fruit juice adds to the body reminds me of lizard of koz obviously but its simpler which is nice  recommendation probably my favorite kbs variant thus far next to espresso musttry
4915,KBS - Blueberry,4.22,bottled 71023  its been a while since ive had anything new from founders but i couldnt resist a new kbs variant blueberry seems like an odd choice for it though i do tend to enjoy fruited stouts when theyre properly executed lets pop it open and see what it has to offer  pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of creamy tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing  the blueberry in the nose is quite gentle almost like they just used a fruity coffee im picking up on aromas of dark roast coffee jammy blueberry milk chocolate maple syrup toasted oak vanilla light cinnamon and a touch of bourbon  theres much more blueberry in taste and it brings a nice tartness to it on the front end of the sip im tasting tart blueberry medium roast coffee dark chocolate toasted oak burnt caramel vanilla earthy bourbon black cherry and light molasses the swallow brings notes of medium roast coffee tart blueberry red grape maple syrup dark chocolate charred oak earthy bourbon molasses light raisin and vanilla  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth beer finishes mostly dry with a fruity tartness that dries things out even further  this isnt my favorite variant but its still very enjoyable prehaps ill pick up a few more bottles

4917,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,3.37,25 fl oz can served in an imperial nonic pint glass  this beer pours straw colored and clear it is topped with an inch of white head that leaves spotty lacing  light lime and fruit aroma  light lime flavor at least this version of ultra has some flavor  thin bodied with a dry mouthfeel  michelob ultra is one of the worst abominations ever labeled as beer at least this has a little flavor
4918,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,4.13,pours a clear barely golden yellow with a head that is like champagne and disappeared fast smell is limegrainssome type of fruitprobably prickly pear taste is delivered clean and neat with a proportionate amount of the adjuncts which are discernible by the individual fruit again feels well put togethercrisprefreshingwell carbonated this beer being organic would not be possible without the huge buying power of inbev overall for a light lager with adjuncts i will rate accordingly to the style this newer version says lime  prickly pear cactus it is also 100 organicand the abv is 40 instead of 42
4919,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,1.97,purchased as a sixpack of bottles from publix for 899 poured into a pils glass posting this review from some notes i wrote down a couple of days ago but only now could post to ba  l  extremely pale yellow with no head and minimal lacing s  smells of corn flakes and faint lime almost sweet t  lime is pretty upfront followed by an almost artificial prickly pear slight hint of dragonfruit and light hay f  lightly carbonated and very light body a step above la croix refreshing o  i dont hate this beer but i find it a bit boring  mostly due to the very light body unable to retain a lot of flavor if it wasnt a light beer i feel like this would be a home run for the michelob lineup glad to have finally tried it though
4920,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,3.57,amazing beer but in a very specific way very refreshing though perhaps not the highest quality beer on the market youre not going to impress your boss but if youre having a nice afternoon kickback or even a summertime party this is a really good option
4921,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,3.62,solid american light lager with added fruit iethe prickly pear i enjoyed this and suggest anyone disregard any rating that suggests its not real beer

4923,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,2.97,we at the 1009 are always on the lookout for new lime experiences infusions have been on the back burner for quite some time since we first spotted it in early spring the time was just not right finally we needed something light at the beech and boy oh boy was this light it was practically water we plopped a lime wedge in the glass to accentuate that citrus bight extremely deletable but sort of resembled a club soda with lime that would come out of the beverage dispenser gun at an applebees

4927,Doubleganger,4.5,poured on 172023 from a 16oz can into a snifter glass  a the beer is a deep gold color with a large foamy white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass  s the aroma contains strong floral and dank hops strong juicy citrus  tropical fruit and caramelized malts  t the taste likewise starts out with a strong floral and dank hops bitterness that is quickly followed by a very strong and juicy citrus  tropical fruit sweetness the malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a very good balance the aftertaste is slightly sweet and slightly hoppy  m crisp and very smooth medium body medium carbonation finish is slightly sticky  o very tasty goes down quite easily not too filling good kick very good representation of style this is a very nice dneipa to drink for a long time
4928,Doubleganger,4.65,look  thick bring slight haze orange with a frothy white head and lacing smell  sooo tropical taste  tropical easy going feel  medium full body with a medium light carb overall  pretty fantastic
4929,Doubleganger,4.27,appearance pours a cloudy orange color with a two finger head strong retention and streaks of lace  smell dank aromatics with passionfruit and pithy orange tones  taste orange pith at the outset with passionfruit adding a milder aspect pretty high bitterness after the swallow  mouthfeel medium to full body with moderate carbonation  overall a bit more like the west coast than other tree house beers  thanks devoured_by_vermin for the opportunity
4930,Doubleganger,4.54,poured from a can 3 weeks from canning into a willi very aromatic on the nose  very tropical with a mango and citrus similar notes on the palate with just a foamy pillowy balance that tree house is known for very mild bitterness theres nothing different here definitely one of their better offerings id love to just have a four pack of this in my fridge at all times just a top notch neipa
4931,Doubleganger,4.68,nice and hazy two finger head that dissipated in a short time some lacing i was interrupted after pouring it so i may have to have another and reevaluate the look aspect of this beer great smooth fruit hoppy flavor with kind of a syrupy finish treehouse makes great beers and this is one of their best
4932,Doubleganger,4.54,canned 81522 purchased 81622 at charlton  l pours a hazy deep gold with a white fluffy head with big bubbles pretty and irregular lacing  a aromas of mango peach and tangerine more complex as it warms  t follows the nose beautifully up front then a surprising hop punch  with no burn  in the middle finishes dry but not too bitter  f soft mouthfeel medium carbonation pleasantly sticky and resinous aftermath  o this is a typical tree house tropicalcitrus delight until the midpalate hop jab sets it apart not necessarily better than the standard offerings but a bit more distinctive
4933,75 Minute IPA,4.3,poured this from a bottle a pours a hazy golden body with thick white head with nice retention and lacing s sweet citrus smelling beer slight alcohol notes t earthy slightly citrus taste with subtle spicy aftertaste m medium bodied and pretty smooth nice drinking beer d nice feel and taste combo solid overall
4934,75 Minute IPA,4,reminded of this beer by the how many beers of fame have you reviewed post reviewed from memory have probably had about a sixpack in my life this is fine but does not live up to the hype
4935,75 Minute IPA,4.1,clear bright amber coloring beautiful bone white head lasting long looking lovely  aroma ah citrus and pine aplenty gorgeous a little tropical fruit melon and pineapple in this nose orange and lime too ah i say again  taste boom just what we want from an ipa but creamy and smooth and just delightful bittersweet notes blast the palate followed by malty sweetness none too caustic this ipa its smooth and palatable as can be  i peeked at the label maple syrup not getting that yet huh  hop bitterness is restrained but enjoyable delicious tasty im loving it im liking this so much its time to find out more about it okay soa bottle conditioned india pale ale with maple syrup 75 abv there are some situations when 90 is too much there are other situations when 60 is too little there are many situations when 75 is just right bottleconditioned with pure maple syrup for complexity and dryhopped out the bejeezum boards
4936,75 Minute IPA,4.14,12oz bottle unfortunately i did not check the bottling date which is 102919 which makes the beer about eleven months in the bottle i picked this up out of the stores cooler and didnt think i needed to date check anyways    cloudy deep gold colored body one finger of lingering white pillowy head not much left on the glass for lacing aroma is grassy and muddy hops with a sweet note from the maple syrup solid malt background taste is grassy and piney hops with a sweet note approaching a bitter note but not quite smooth trail off into the after taste allowing the beer to sit on the tongue really brings out the maple and hop combination mouth feel is the best attribute of the beer with dense coating and filling of the mouth very good carbonation i will try to try this again with a younger bottling date but this is still a very good hoppy but sweet concoction
4937,75 Minute IPA,3.91,i got a bottle of this beer off the single shelf at a beer store in lacrosse wi whilst there to move my daughter into school the beer poured a clear golden with thin white head that is leaving a nice lace the scent was mild hop notes the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with smooth citrus hop presence and a tangerine finish the mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation overall it is a good beer
4938,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.25,poured into a tulip  pours clear dark brown with garnet highlights excellent tan foamy head limited head excellent lacing  detectable to strong acidity on the nose with dark fruit and caramel sugar notes perhaps some orange peel  the flavor is complex and refined acidic but not overpoweringly so excellent balance with sweeter flavors of apple raisin and a bit of oaking the mature beer portion of this blend is what keeps the restraint just right  like the flavor the feel is well balanced not drying but not sticky either vanishing carbonation the first few sips have a fair amount it subsides into tart smoothness quickly  for my personal taste this brew may be a shade sweet and tame for the style but thats also the level of restraint the brewer was intentionally pursuing nailed it to say the least
4939,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.79,poured from the bottle into belgian tulips its too cold for critical tasting but i didnt want wait my wife loves sours so ive tried many over the years l muddy river water hazy brown not the look id be shooting for but we dont drink beer with our eyes s beautiful you can smell the acid forthwith accompanied by caramel or toffee a box of raisins maybe some orange peel t racy acidity sour orange raisins and toffee long sour finish elegant stuff compared to the kettle sours you find sometimes at brewpubs not as serious and complex as our best wild ales somewhere in between f appropriate weight any more malt and it would be a mess definitely not too thin o a fun treat  glad someone came up with this style of beer back in the dark ages they built some beautiful gothic cathedrals too so maybe not too dark the acidity of this one is high and more to my wifes tastes  i think i prefer the duchesse one but this is still super fantastic
4940,Rodenbach Grand Cru,3.34,nice deep amber brown colour smell is vinager mostly balsamic hard to describe smell and flavour very vinegar but in a good way still a bit much for me i may need to try more sours
4941,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.11,330ml bottle into a goblet my best guess at age is bottled september 2020  head vanishes quickly lightly sour aroma but the taste is solidly sour with a sweetness in the background light body and a drying finish
4942,Rodenbach Grand Cru,2.42,appearance poured with a sliver of head that simply couldnt stick around and produced no lace the body is a opaque cloudy brown which barely reveals a hint of red when put up to the light which i suppose is appropriate to style but doesnt seem very appetizing to me for some reason  smell oh dearits like some kind on unholy mix of wine apple cider and malt vinegar i think i am also catching a bit of caramel malt in the background i will given points certainly of potency as zero warmup needed for that to be produced ill also give it points for complexity but this is an assault on my olfactory senses this is a sour at a level that i just cant see liking  taste where this beer starts is where id have liked it to end there is a potent lemon note seemingly barely curbed by some nice notes of cherry and apple but then the beast is let loose as it passed outright into drinking vinegar with some brown sugar thrown into it before this odd dry sand skunkness kind of creeps in over the ruins of that experience there is identifiable complexity here but the core sour component overshadows it its like an indy band you like touring with a band that plays with metal nails and a chalkboard  mouthfeel the transitioning here starts high and jumps into orbit and is then lost to the solar winds leaving behind acid and sand for us to contemplate that passes to go back to just a sour lemon note in the aftertaste which would could be present if you didnt experience what caused it carbonation is also pretty much absent here theres very little here i enjoy  drinkability drinkable like a fancy lemonade made with every bell and whistle except you used half the water and no sugar way too potent for my liking and the acidic note i mentioned earlier seems to linger at the top of my stomach after it has gone down at least the low carbonation doesnt further agitate things down there  final thoughts i dont think ive ever had a flanders red ale i truly liked but i also dont recall one ever being this potent i know there are people who enjoy this and that this is their jam there are notes there that tell me yes this beer is a remarkably complex offering however for me they are buried under the sour note of this offering this is very much not for me and didnt even make it pass the half way mark if you relish in sours this might be for you but this is a hard pass for me
4943,Rodenbach Grand Cru,3.74,i do not like sours but this is one that got it right would not consider it sour but tangy in a way initially i felt the smell was of a nail polish fragrance but learning that its made with red wine vineger explains that definitely would order another if im in the mood for a tangy beer
4944,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.54,when it hit my lips my first words were oh wow  appearances can be deceiving because its not much to look at but a fragrant nose and a great feel along with terrific smooth taste and flavor gives us a big time thumbs up for me
4945,V.S.O.R.,4.85,big thanks to whomever sent this 12 oz can to me as i continue to fantasize about every ryeway ever imagined can dated 11922  pour is deep brown tickling black with a cokelike head that collapses just as fast smells better than some scratchandsniff porn ive dabbled in oak caramel  that sweet spicy rye  vsor is swinging for fences that it cant even see with the naked eye the rye is amped up to 16  a bellowing chimera unsure if you could cram more spicy rye into a liquid unless the glass was made of raw rye too and my tongue no subtle sideeye here massive rye booze oak with some toffee  brown sugar on the finish i could drink a four pack knowing that i wouldnt awaken for days  borderline perfect revolution has done the impossible improved on a stunning ross ryeway wow
4946,V.S.O.R.,4.23,this one hits well not like thor or john henry with a hammer but more like mozart with that stick thing i feel thunder but there is no boom and because of that its brilliant like tesla in thought or freud with a cuban cigar there we are and by that i mean here i am in liquid paradise  play with your hamster dont be a bad dad
4947,V.S.O.R.,4.7,2022 batch dated 11922 and drank on 31923  pours a very dark brown color with a finger of tan head that went away fairly quickly  aroma is maple syrup werthers originals pecan pie caramelized brown sugar sweet brown bread fig dark cherry rye bread big toasted oak tannin big rye whiskey and bourbon spirit some vanillin decadent yet balanced from the huge barrel character  taste brings cr√®me brulee sugar daddies maple and bourbondrizzled pecan some molasses some black cherry dates some apricot rye bread and spice leather charred oak vanillin rye whiskey and bourbon spirit exquisite balance between the sweet characteristics of the base and the rye and barrel presence impressive  full body which is impressive for an extendedaged beer just enough carbonation to move the beer through the palate slick sticky oily boozy dries out on the finish a bit from the alcohol barrel and rye spice thankfully but this still remains a sweet and decadent beer  the blending on this is masterful wonderful complexity and balance revolutions barrel program is finally getting the recognition it deserves recently top 5 barrel program in the country imho
4948,V.S.O.R.,4.45,canned 11922  i had ryeway to heaven for the first time last summer and quite enjoyed it then while in chicago earlier this week i was able to try boss ryeway which was even better now ive reached the apex vsor the highest rated rye beer on ba lets crack this big boy open and see what it has to offer  pours a mostly clear dark brown with 3 fingers of light tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  the nose here is definitively closer to boss ryeway though more fruitdriven than nutty im picking up on aromas of brown sugar raisin toasted oak molasses burnt caramel vanilla black cherry old leather rye whiskey and candied peanut  its very sweet in taste but also very balanced its fully rounded on the front end of the sip im tasting toasted pecan fig smooth oak rye whiskey apricot brown sugar sweet caramel black cherry and toffee the swallow brings notes of molasses toasted oak black cherry sweet whiskey raisin burnt caramel maple light vanilla and leather  a full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a slick beer finishes a tad sticky with a boozy presence  shocking absolutely nobody this is an awesome beer revolution consistently kills it with big beers

4950,V.S.O.R.,4.26,rubytinted amber with a large airy sandcolored head that fizzes away fairly quickly leaving a churning center and large crown  vanilla leather caramel cherry pepper and alcohol in the nose  leather and peppery rye throughout the taste with some lovely vanilla maple and cr√®me br√ªl√©e beneath a touch of earthy hops and strong booze in the moderately bitter finish  sticky syrupy feel moderate carbonation  really tasty the rye pops and the bitter and leathery base goes well against the barrel sweetness

4960,Heavy Mettle,4.05,can from tfontana thanks for the opportunity hazy murky lemon orange color with a frothy white head that dissipates lemony grapefruity citrus with hints of mango and pineapple with a hint of pine and resin sweet bready malt underneath and a hint of warming alcohol far out and solid
4961,Olde English 800,2.8,the taste of my childhood so theres that for what it is its amazing theres no possible way you could finish the warm backwash in that 40oz
4962,Olde English 800,2.7,bang for your buck highly recommend
4963,Olde English 800,2.15,man i dont know where to begin this product tastes horrible and is an extremely difficult chug my olde english product was unfortunately expired which could have caused the horrible metal like after taste would only recommend if you have 4 dollars lying around looking for a good time
4964,Olde English 800,3.28,a  perfectly clear medium gold with light carbonation  s  big sweet corn grain malt aroma with some malt sweetness  t  corn grain sweetness that finmishes on the sweeter side  m  light medium body  o  not as terrible as the overall score suggests not great but not terrible
4965,Olde English 800,2.87,42oz plastic bottle best by july 31st 2023  on the pour a surprisingly springy white 3 finger head formed with surprisingly decent retention with a slow recession to a rocky slightly foamy appearance body is highly carbonated and a golden straw almost laces but not quite  aroma is immediately skunky but present classic american and or noble hops a bit of a metallic aroma backs the skunk somewhat pleasantly surprisingly light aroma  flavor is sweet and bready woth a touch of that skunky hop still present arguably almost syrupy sweet but not a bad beer actually quite smooth and soft with an almost nutty malt character  feel is very full again verging on if not full blown syrupy  overall this was a pleasant surprise ive had a very expired oe before and it was terrible this much fresher 2nd go round is much more pleasant and drinkable a bit too sweet though
4966,Olde English 800,2.42,pours out of the can a crystal clear gold with minimal head smells slightly sweet and grainy taste follows the nose while being relatively thin its not bad but not the most prolific malt beverage
4967,Olde English 800,4.12,was able to have a beer of every style in 2022 so decided to end the year with class poured a clear golden dark yellow with 15 head with good retention and minimal lacing nose was sweet corn and a bit of grain no boozy or harsh notes taste followed with lightly sweet corn and malt with enough bitterness to keep it from cloying mouthfeel had moderate weight and was rather crisp a great example of the style and easy to get down in bulk
4968,Olde English 800,2.93,cant believe i have not reviewed this until now the stronger version at 75 abv out of the clear plastic 42 ounce screw top bottle to kick off our holiday bottle share nice bring i am immediately surprised at how this really isnt that bad its got some body some actual malt character and doesnt present as cheap as it actually is golden honey colored super excited frothy cream white head with nice wispy retention and visibly high carbonation nice clarity too looks just fine the nose and somewhat subtle when this is cold and thats how its best falls apart a little at temperature but cold its kind of brisk a little nutty and sweet only faintly metallic no yeast or hops at all but kind of clean baked and bready the flavor is a little worse but when its cold i swear its not bad its when it warms up a little that it gets sweet and heavy and weirdly alcoholic and a touch astringent too sweet most of the way a little corny or otherwise adjuncty but there is decent pale barley malt in this too i am sure of it i even get some minerals before the finish i dont hate this i know i should but i dont and in the context of a bunch of wild saisons and heavy stouts i came back to this one a few times the mouthfeel is both hearty and refreshing at the same time and the value of this is off the charts far better than its ratings and objectively better than most of its peers
4969,Olde English 800,1,i am a big believer that you have to experience something before you have the right to comment this usually applies to movies for whatever reason after seeing crushed cans of old english littering sidewalks for years and dismissing the sight as why would anyone drink that i decided i had to man up and try it so i took my 199 and bought a 24 ounce can wow in some ways it was more sad than bad i understand that in the past 59 abv was a big deal and dudes just purchased it to get their drunk on but nowadays thats considered lightweight okay those beers likely cost more than 199 there nothing there taste wise it wasnt horrible it wasnt anything but a slightvery slight hint of fruitiness bland burger sad i regret it all
4970,Olde English 800,2.85,dark gold amber looking color had 1 finger of white head on the pour and quickly lost half that looks like the half left is slowly dropping as i type lazy streaming carbonation visible  nose is a touch sweet grain smell on the nose comes through like corn grain  the mouth is sweet and a bit of a malt like flavor seems simple on the taste lets put the two together now we have sweet malts is it overly sweet no  mouth feel starts as a bit medium and finishes surprisingly well a touch of lingering sweet malt and yes there is the grain on the back of the mouth that sits there for a minute  i am in las vegas nv and was able to get the 75 abv version and i did chill the crap out of the 24 oz can before i cracked it i think if this higher abv higher than the 59 abv version were to get warmed up it may have that malt liquor taste i find unpleasant kind of that i am trying to be a lager why the shit did they add this fructose syrup to spoil me type of thing if this were to warm up and had a sweeter taste were to come out i would say no way i will say i have had much worse malt liquor beers for sure still searching for my final opinion the one thing i do not like is i find myself trying to drink it before it warms and today is a warm day even though i am inside ok maybe that is what this is for fast slam hopefully quick buzz on a cheap beer kind of a four loko beer thing enough rambling how about will i buy it again the higher abv warming does come through a bit towards the end as i try to chase a chilled product buy it again is still a questionable thought i really do not think i would try this again unless i could get the lower abv more along the lines of an icehouse beer yet there may be a fit for this with some heavy meats on a good bbq day damn now i am just hungry this has been an exhausting push and pull beer review i really look forward to more people trying the higher gravity and seeing what they think i think at 59 and being cheap again around the icehouse region this might work i know people look for the higher gravity one yet now i seek the lower gravity one so sorry for the ramble ladies and gents cheers
4971,Olde English 800,4,malt liquor or adjunct lager is a mass produced cheap quality beer everyone who has consumed gas station beer is aware oe800 is the king of malt liquor as they claim i relocated to a large metropolitan area from a small rural community so i never even saw oe800 i lived here for almost 6 months before i actually bought a tall boy i was pleasantly surprised literally the best malt liquor i have ever consumed very similar to bud and bud is not that good when compared to craft lager a sale price with sales tax included of 139 is a decent value
4972,Olde English 800,1.57,first time ever that ive tried this beer even though its been around for so long way back when way before the beer craze began this was the big go to beer for certain groups of people and it was probably because of the abv anyway i digress finally tried this and i was really sorry i did blehh terrible beer
4973,Olde English 800,2.82,ahh miss tha good ol days with tha glass 40s of old e damn times changed
4974,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,4.03,great fruity taste but the look in the glass and the artificial smell hinders it a tweak or two and this could be a classic ipa that is great at hiding the high alcohol content
4975,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,4.61,i like it it a lot since i usually do not care for most hop heavy ipas i am more of a malt heavier beer lover prefer red ales some stouts and porters i truly enjoyed the fruit forward juice flavor especially in summer the high alcohol content is a nice bonus
4976,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,4.4,strong vick pleaser
4977,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,3.48,had voodoo ranger juice force ipa poured from 12oz can bottom stamped apparently canned on 230622 and apparently best by 21dec2023 into tulip pint  pours cloudy gold with 1finger nearwhite head resembling a hefeweizen with decent retention leaving some sketchy lace down the glass big juicy fruit bubble gum aroma off pour backed by a bit of noble hop spice and slightly ameliorated by some classic pale ale apple aroma as warms on tasting begins sweet juicy fruit bubble gum like the aroma over a nice smooth light malt base with a bit of that apa apple showing in the flavor before a little herbal hop bite cuts the bubble gum for the finish  the over the top bubble gum aroma is inherently frivolous and misleading about the serious 950 abv of this beer but at least the alcohol content is serious because otherwise this beer is a clown show
4978,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,3.19,its not as good as the imperial but its a solid choice if you like bitter ales it sneaks up on you so be prepared
4979,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,1.97,definitely not a real hazy tastes like ethanol with hip essence carbonation is large almost like a mcdonalds coke i really do not like this too much alcohol too much orange flavoring too harsh carbonation kinda not that good the young folks drink these a lot to get drunk quickly
4980,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,5,new belgium is my new favorite beer great job 
4981,Ayinger Oktober Fest-M√§rzen,4.1,september 2023 hartwell super smooth and easy to drink definitely a go to for oktoberfest
4982,Ayinger Oktober Fest-M√§rzen,4,excellent oktoberfest very well balanced
4983,Ayinger Oktober Fest-M√§rzen,4.06,beautiful crisp clear beer snowy fluffy white head caps it off bubbly zesty and crisp feel malt yeast and biscuit on nose and taste decent dry finish lovely stuff from a superb brewery
4984,Ayinger Oktober Fest-M√§rzen,4.24,many many years ago i was fortunate enough to actually sit in biergarten of this amazing brewer  it was one of the highlights to my entire trip to bavaria  if this is what these people say octoberfest beer should taste like im fine with that that said pretty darn good
4985,Ayinger Oktober Fest-M√§rzen,4.55,best marzen i tried with some margin not overly sweet and i could not feel alcohol like in other marzens amazing as expected really from ayinger
4986,Ayinger Oktober Fest-M√§rzen,4.1,pours a nearly clear copper color with a 1f head with moderate lacing  smells of malt and yeast  tastes of sweet lightly toasted malt bready yeast and caramel with a slightly bitter alcohol warm finish  medium light body with light carbonation slightly syrupy mouthfeel  this is a very drinkable sweet brew
4987,Ayinger Oktober Fest-M√§rzen,4,my first authentic marzen what a nice beer cant wait to buy more
4988,Ayinger Oktober Fest-M√§rzen,3.7,really good sweet bready flavor smells the same classic beer
4989,Cuv√©e Saint-Gilloise,4.01,5 oz tiny snifter draft pour at monks for zwanze day 2022 review copied from scant notes taken on my phone  pale bitter palate numbing  what i can add from memory somewhat tart and biting but lines were blurred with its sedate subtly herbal delayed bitter hum took my time sipping this one trying to delineate where the funk ended and hop infusion began cloudy in appearance and expression id of course be curious to try this from a bottle decant decent opener for the event 2037
4990,Cuv√©e Saint-Gilloise,4.03,pours a hazy gold 1 white head mild lacing nose is hairspray lemon hay and lots of barny wet funk taste follows forward with sweet mildly tart white wine lemon but little expression of the funkier elements on the nose as it warms the sweetness and tartness of the wine continue to open but little in the way of earthy funkier elements feel is smooth with moderate carbonation but it drinks cleanly and invitingly overall however lacking in some complexity on the palate
4991,Cuv√©e Saint-Gilloise,4.46,2019 vintage stored under okay conditions stable environment very little light the beer pours a nice offwhite head that forms at a moderate pace not too fast but gradual the beer itself is a clear metallic amber color that looks very good  the smell is absolutely wonderful it starts off with light strawberry notes while cold and warms up to let through a variety of citrus fruit notes such as grapefruit orange a light lemon and hints of lime that pop in and out the funk note is moderate with hay notes to it  the taste is very good it has a strong citrus fruit note upfront that consists of grapefruit and a stronger lime note than in the smell the funk shows up mostly as a musty hay not with a acidic tartness to it  the feel is good it has a light to medium body and moderate carbonation it has moderate acidity  overall a delicious cuvee worth getting and holding for a few years in ideal conditions  away from light and stable temps
4992,Shiner M√§rzen-Style Oktoberfest,3.46,clear bright amber color with a respectable and lasting head the aroma is toasted caramel malt and a hint of brown sugar the taste is lightly sweet toasted caramel malt slightly metallic with a bit of herbal hops in the finish the body is lightmedium moderate carbonation smooth and fairly drinkable altogether this is a modest attempt at an octoberfest solid and drinkable but nothing special
4993,Shiner M√§rzen-Style Oktoberfest,3.17,look clear amber with a white head that dissipated quickly  smell pretty sweet up front with roasty and earthy notes blending in  taste follows smell pretty well the aftertaste reminds me of a cheaper lager which i didnt love  feel medium body normal carbonation  overall solid drinkable but nothing to write home about
4994,Shiner M√§rzen-Style Oktoberfest,2.71,i had high hopes for this brew but alas i am again disappointed im a regular drinker of shiner bock but thus far i have not been impressed with any of their other brews this just continues that impression the flavor was a bit muted and flat not at all like a good oktoberfest drinkable but why when there are so many really good fest beers to be had why settle for a merely average beer
4995,Shiner M√§rzen-Style Oktoberfest,3.47,12oz bottle  on a hard pour 3 fingers of dense off white head formed on top of a relatively hazy light amber body head retention is quite nice  aroma is quite clean with a toasty molassesy malt character there is a slight fruity funk in the back that i dont quite love has some cheap lager smell going on  taste is better than the aroma and brings a more solid toasty malt flavor as well as some light earthy and herbal hops that provide some bitterness this beer does come off as quits sweet and some of the fruitiness from the aroma sticks around but doesnt blend well with everything else  feel is super drinkable but the sweet maltiness does make for a slightly syrupy finish probably more enjoyable when drunk from the bottle
4996,Shiner M√§rzen-Style Oktoberfest,3.47,12 oz bottle into a becher glass l pours crystal clear rust amber with a 1 soapy light khaki head vg retention steady carbo bubbles minimal light scattered lacing s slightly metallic floral caramelized malts t lightly sweet caramelized malts a touch of honey a light hint of citrus zest very lightly metallic lightly bitter  dry in the finish gently sweet overall f smooth lightly creamy medlight body with a gentle medfast lightly drying finish o everything about this beer is light it is well balanced with a pleasant aroma and is easy drinking with a smooth flow it is good in its style
4997,Shiner M√§rzen-Style Oktoberfest,3.67,this is surprisingly sweet definitely not traditional drinks well and tastes like a seasonal twist on a dark lager similar to but better than the sam adams version
4998,Shiner M√§rzen-Style Oktoberfest,3,look taste  smell was ok but the taste was too hoppy for the style additionally the alcohol taste didnt blend well upon the first  second swallow
4999,Shiner M√§rzen-Style Oktoberfest,3.48,clear amber brown body with a white head for the appearance this one is a simpler marzen macro sweet caramel malt in a halfhearted intensity toast and thats about it maybe a tiny hint of earthy hops on the very last iota of the finish feels watered down yeast is not a factor malt dominates but is watery but hey it looks nice in a mug
5000,Shiner M√§rzen-Style Oktoberfest,2.49,crystal clear color looks alright but i have difficulty with this sort of color color blind head is anemic dissipating quickly and leaving no cap  aroma is initially fruity lager esters ie generic beer aroma toasty bread crusty and caramel the caramel starts to take over on subsequent nosing trending toward toffee though the crustiness is still present mild herbal hop character is apparent in the background as well not particularly deep or complex but not unpleasant though caramel and esters are not appropriate for the style  on the palate the arrival is sweet malt with fruity esters running through out the mid palate comes strongly into a pleasant bread crust flavor followed by good hop bitterness the finish is dry and pleasant with a lingering mild bitterness the caramel and toffee are in the palate as well but the crusty flavor is stronger again not really appropriate for the style  mouthfeel is a bit on the light side close but not quite creamy moderately carbonated and a pleasantly dry finish  just as a beer its decent i would drink this again hence the overall of 35 as a m√§rzen its not a good representation of the style
5001,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.04,poured from a bottle into a pint glass pours pitch black with a small light brown head smells of grassy hops with very slight dark roasted grain tastes of citrus and earthy hops with nice chocolate notes beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation overall a very good beer
5002,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,3.77,poured from a 12 oz can has a black color with a 12 inch head smell is of pine roasted malts taste is dank pine light roasted malts a touch of alcohol significant bitterness feels mediumfull bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer
5003,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.13,pours black with a couple fingers of khaki foam aroma is sticky resin with toasty and roasty malts underneath sticky but dark with earthy undertones flavor profile is sticky resin and mild dank hops with roasty and toasty malts underneath caramel and earthy flavors build as the beer warms its a really sticky ipa but with dark stout undertones mouth feel is mediumthick with a mild velvet fluffy texture very low grit overall sticky dark beer which is always a juxtaposition but in a favorable way  served in a 155oz spiegelau tulip from a 12oz bottle reviewed from notes
5004,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.34,picked up a six pack pours almost black strong flavor that was great makes you feel great became my go to beer for about a month did my job to bring it back next year
5005,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.44,great in between beer i love stouts i love ipas this one is perfectly in between for me
5006,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.57,look black in the glass with a finger of foam opaque coarse bubbles lots of lacing smell super dank roasted coffee and pine taste the perfect 5050 between stout and ipa chocolate coffee molasses caramel with a nice hoppy finish feel heavy and dry mildly carbonated overall incredible but not a regular drink super delicious for special occasions
5007,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.5,deep dark brown in color nice roast notes floral man that first sip is deep in roasty malt flavor and good hops too caramelized flavor and some char character medium to full and long finish boy i am glad to finally try this and i want more
5008,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.3,12 oz can packaged 1522 poured into a nonic pint glass  mahogany brown color with two fingers fine tan head full lacing curtains and 1 cm cap pine plum grapefruit light toasted malt aromas citrus light licorice raisin dark chocolate light char flavors good bitter hop mouthfeel initially more flavors appears across the tongue great lasting carbonation no alcohol heat dry finish great flavor combination with the piney hops and dark malt always a place for this beer
5009,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,5,im very impressed with stone for this onemost stone ipas have the same exact generic bitterness however this one is different this one has a balanced hop flavor balanced bitterness and is ohsosmooth pours a dark brown like the color of the glass bottle it came in yet looks basically black poured into a glass has a head you would expect from a darker beer like thisthe head dissipated but still left a thin lingering layerthe lacing is wonderful the 87 abv is extremely wellhidden in this brew honestlythis does leave your tongue longing for more sip after sip with the melody of flavors im about 23 done with this 1 pt 6 oz bottle and i have no idea why im already feeling buzzed nice work on a unique brew stone try it while you can as it is a limited rerelease
5010,Swish,4.65,pale opaque orange with thin tan head standard hazy look smell is complex with pithy rind orange vanilla and malts similar smell to some of the hill farmstead ipas extremely bright taste with tons of tropical sweet notes however has a nice bitterness at the end pleasing feel that doesnt linger too long swish is a spectacular hazy that stands uniquely in a sea of copy cats
5011,Swish,4.59,bissell brothers is the larry birdmagic johnson of breweries to me not a knock at all but my mj is the alchemist that being said the swish drops in to my stomach like a steph curry logo 3 point shot nothing but net all swish beautiful laker gold color completely opaque with a slight bubbly froth on the nose you get phoenix suns orange with some miami heat tropical pineapple notes was expecting a thick shaq like body but its a more lean medium body reminiscent of a dwight howard taste wise you get the traditional ipa bitter hop bite that gives a slight celtics green herby taste however it also has that new wave neipa melon cream citrus fruit flavor the neipa is the new dynasty the golden state warriors of the beer industry what an absolute treat go nuggets
5012,Swish,4.62,16 oz can 011073 041723 purchased cold 4pk at the brewery 2 days ago poured into my trillium fat tulip  l impenetrablyhazy pale yellowamber liquid with mildly golden highlights on the fringes moderately tall foam rise on the pour sinking back into a misty cap bit of a letdown from the lame head retention and little lacing  s lime hull lemon peel mango funk grapefruit pith slight capsicum spicy accent cream of wheat vibrant greenness cutting through the perfumy fruits the booze does boost the contact and seduction  t much more malt and mush than id anticipated and its great floral rush halfway morphing into a tropical cleaver into the finish during which a powdery grain flour note swells up and hangs up front long into the aftertaste almost halfway through and wow did the tropical hopping burst back onto my palate fresh and enlivening masterpiece of balance for its ilk  f only a faint sense of alcohol at the back of the palate the milky grains and silky hop resins team to tame the heat i suppose i wouldnt go any higher with the abv for this style 75 is usually my sweet spot and this is just tickling the tonsils just inching toward unnecessary noxiousity  o not a fan of hazies but this shot right up into my top 3 or 4 they really do have a good thing going as ive very much enjoyed the unique character of each brand ive tried from them i could definitely see getting this again good excuse for another beer run to maine it has a lot going on for the style some depth and dimension to the gritty grain bill too smooth and moreish 2122
5013,Swish,4.41,pours a very hazy gold with a thumb of cream colored head average head retention  lacing thought i had a clean glass  s citrus  tropical fruits nice nose  t oranges dryness mangoes dryness  green melons  strawberry up front mangoes peaches green melon  a little acidic pineapple plus a little dryness as this beer warms finishes a little dry with plenty of pineapple green melon  strawberry  mf medium body restrained carbonation nicely balanced acidity on the tongue  a brilliant take on the style pretty juicy
5014,Swish,4.74,on tap at mekong in rva hazy darker gold with a proper head huge citrus and bright tropical fruit juices with a slightly floral aroma big balanced grapefruit and other citrus which is tamed and balanced super juicy and refreshing feel majestic ipa
5015,Swish,4.25,on tap pours a moderately hazy orange taste is dominated by a bright berry flavor assuming thats from the mosaic solid neipa but not the standout its rating would suggest
5016,Consecration,4.2,served from a tap in a clear pint glass its modest biege head didnt last long the brew is a deep brownamber almost mahogany bright and surprisingly clear for all the color the only aroma is that almost woody sourness common to good barrel aged ales the barrel tannins dominate even the brettanomyces and currants to taste no minor feat yet the taste is complex enough that they can be specifically detected there are too many sours that are really some degree of tart this is also a little tart but its unmistakably sour the woody tannins linger a little too long in the aftertaste other than that theres no complaint here the high abv isnt noticed the taste is full and complex delivered within a body thats rich for the style
5017,Consecration,4,good sour and barrel flavors
5018,Consecration,3.01,375ml corktopped bottle bottled on 090622 and served in a stemless cbc glass brilliant ruby color with great clarity and little head inhaling through my nose i get hit with a powerful whallop of sourness oh boy yes the flavor is sour too its more balanced than i would have given it credit for based on the aroma and the first sip but its fizzy and tart without much flavor to my palate i dont get fruit i dont get wine barrel i dont get chocolate or tobacco or any of the other flavors printed on the label but i also dont get ethanol and at 10 abv thats really saying something  i feel compelled to finish this beer but please take it away from me
5019,Consecration,4.34,look  brownish orange with an initial head fizz smell tart acidic with a wine wood taste  tart fruity woody slight acidic and citrus some spices and dark fruit feel  full body crisp overall  pretty great
5020,Bud Light Lime,2.71,i think this is a good beer to have after working in the hot florida sun goes down smooth and easy
5021,Bud Light Lime,2.52,from a 12oz bottle vintage denoted as 22241vm1544 served in a cervoise because fancy  pours an effervescent pale honeygold with a scant finger of fizzy suds the head doesnt stay around long enough to get much of a look at just leaving the narrowest possible collar and a superslippery film of what we may refer to as lacing  nose is bright and citrusy and otherwise has a faint cereal character aroma of lime just as advertised  taste is corny and soapy with tarttacky citrus tasting the titular lime corn pops breakfast cereal and seltzer water  feel is slick and soapy mediumthin bodied with fizzy seltzerlike carbonation in fact each sip finishes not entirely unlike limeflavoured seltzer water  overall absolutely not utterly vile its what the kids are drinking or at least what one of them left in my fridge
5022,Bud Light Lime,2.33,24oz can poured in a glass  on the pour thre fingers of head form with some retention off the bat but after a moment instead of a rocky head forming it got fizzy and dissipated body is a completely clear gold for a light lime lager this is looking real fake  aroma is mostly the same lime flavor that comes on hint of lime chips which i dont hate probably because of the real lime peels used in the back there is a carbonic acid aroma like generic seltzer water with a very light bud light funk smells blandly acidic with a hint of lime  taste follows the aroma but admittedly loses the off flavors still however those is very bland and would probably be most enjoyable after a strong malt liquor while outside in very hot weather this is about as flavorful as a lime truly but with a slight and light reminder that this is beer with a very vague malt character at the end  feel is the only decent category here it is drinkable like regular bud light but it almost comes off as even more watery despite that the lime flavoring amd possible sweetener makes the finish long amd a bit syrupy meh  overall the only reason to drink this is if you cant afford leinies summer shandy but you desperately need something different than the cheap lagers in the 24oz cooler at the gas station
5023,Bud Light Lime,3.7,whats a better lime beer than this to all craft beer snobswomen what is better just buy regular beer that doesnt taste like dogshit if you want something strong pour a real glass this forum is fucking sad
5024,Bud Light Lime,3.56,out of all the lime flavored beers its the most refreshing on a hot day
5025,Bud Light Lime,4.74,look light haze like looking through a deeply familiar cozy mist rolling through the family farmstead  smell rivaled only by traversing through the fields of tecom√°n on a warm day at peak lime season  taste like plucking its carefullyblended native fruit off of a tree and sipping its gentlyfermented contents through a frosted platinumlined metal straw  feel silky soft comfortable horse blanket on a frigid autumn morning nostalgic and pure truly joyous unmistakable and irreplaceable  overall the perfect beer overlooked but likely not for long many are behind on this one but it will have its day and when it does i do genuinely hope budweiser keep an eye on this beermaker can meet customer demand
5026,Bud Light Lime,1.08,i beseech thee why did anyone think we needed this sadly better than bud light regular tastes like beer vomit but at least its got the character that plain light beer doesnt
5027,Bud Light Lime,1.37,look same as budlight clear yellow  smell lime thats it  taste tates like really bad limes  feel nothing its still water  overall congratulations you just drank lime water with a hint of alcohol
5028,Ten FIDY,4.41,a black body covered with a twofinger brown head assimilates into a pint glass the head is quite active and fades in a few minutes but leaves ample lacing the carbonation level is good the smell is absurdly light for a 105 abv imperial stout mostly malt and grain with a subtle sweetness on the back end the flavor however is superb coffee and chocolate notes malt grains nuttiness subdued hops for the style this beer is finely crafted and literally wafts across the tongue like waves on the beach especially as it warms during the session the high abv stout category has been somewhat overrun by a faddish movement toward barrel aged brews and many of them are great beers but oscar blues ten fidy is a great example of how good a finely designed imperial stout can be in the hands of a great brewer i love this beer
5029,Ten FIDY,1,gave this beer a try on a whim and i must say that i was beyond disappointed in this brew the whole thing tasted and smelled of rubbing alcohol flavored stout a shame really i enjoy oskar blues and this was just a tremendous letdown not even worth finishing the can off
5030,Ten FIDY,4.32,first sniff is chocolate first taste is hops im surprised i didnt rate this the first time i tried it this is a solid surprisingly notsweet what an ipa would like to be option
5031,Ten FIDY,4.59,poured black really black with a brown head that stood tall the aroma while not as strong as it would be for most as my nose has been affected by covid is still coffee and roasted malts the taste is an amazing balance of flavors the roasted malts bring the coffee and cacao and dark fruits and the hops provide an edge that keeps the flavor in check the feel is almost chewy and it seems right for all the flavors that are present this is one of my favorite pure imperial stouts just so good
5032,Ten FIDY,4.48,purchased as part of a 4 pack of 12 oz cans  l pitch black with a moderate creamy head  s almost sweet roasted cocoa aroma  t sweet dark chocolate upfront slight hop bite followed by a dark roasted coffee and chocolate finish  f moderate mouthfeel smooth with a slight tannic bite  o an absolutely beautiful imperial stout
5033,Ten FIDY,4.38,pours black as night dark foam sweet malt aroma heavy roasted chocolate malt body coffee and caramel finish sweet but not overly sweet smoother than expected but you can definitely taste the alcohol not for the amateur beer drinker
5034,Ten FIDY,4.33,pours a jet black that forms a moderate caramel head dissipates at a slower pace and leaves a good amount of soapy lacing and a nice level of retention on the top aromas of licorice cherries roasted malt chocolate and coffee taste is heavy on the roasted malts bitter chocolate coffee and earthy hops becomes sweeter towards the aftertaste with a boozy finish mediumbodied a very good imperial stout that is worth a revisit
5035,Ten FIDY,4.09,l 475 opaque black body dark tan head s 375 dark fruits and a hint of mocha t 4 upgrade from the nose dark chocolate caramel roasted malt and west coast hops f 45 thick mouthfeel but smooth o 425 great american imperial stout
5036,Ten FIDY,4.4,purchased at pennridge beverage perkasie pa 164pk 12oz cans  pours a pitch black abyss black a dense but quicky fading beige head on the initial pour leaves sticky lacing on the glass after each sip  aromas of roasty malts and chocolate very inviting  a delicous imperial stout great tastes of chocolate deep roasted malts and a definite boozy aftertaste very drinkable even at a 105 abv  very smooth consistency with low to moderate carbonation leaves a nice coating in your mouth after each sip  overall a topnotch stout highly recommendedcheers
5037,Ten FIDY,4.04,poured from a 12 oz can dated 10122022 into a snifter glass l  pours a dark brown color with a nice tan head that dissipates slowly s  smells of chocolate and coffee t  taste follows the smell lots of bitter coffee and bakers chocolate with some booziness on the finish f  medium to full bodied and lightly carbonated o  tasty boozy stout
5038,Ten FIDY,4.02,pours black with a fluffy sculpted three finger head that lasts and coats the glass with foam aroma is roasted black malt there is a resemblance of coffee as well taste is roasted malt with a touch of sweetness as if it were similar to a milk stout however the black malt is the overarching profile here along with it comes a feeling of bubbles on the tongue at the end of the profile
5039,Ten FIDY,4.18,12 oz can canned on date 26 nov 2018 consumed on 25 dec 2022 glass tulip snifter abv 105 serving temp room temp   look black with a 2finger high brown head the head dissipates to a thick ring and cover lacing is very good  smell deep and dark roasted malts bittersweet chocolate and some faint coffee light licoriceanise and a hint of molasses earthy and somewhat spicy hops  taste an earthy hop bitterness starts things off but is quickly met and balanced by the substantial roasted dark malt notes coffee and chocolate first bittersweet but quickly changing to semisweet are noticeable a mild sweetness appears that is a combo of semisweet chocolate molasses and faint dark fruits a quick hit of earth comes back and lingers in through the finish the sip finishes a shade dry  feel creamy velvety and viscous there is a nice warmth from the alcohol the body is between medium and mediumfull though closer to medium  overall a very nice imperial stout that makes a great winter warmer and fireplace sipper nice balance and even complexity  the 4 years of age have had a wonderful effect on this brew if i recall it when fresh it has been a couple of years it was quite bitter and even one note maybe two notes now it is superb i wonder how it would be at 5 years  i also wonder if the ibus have been reduced in more recent versions i recall either 75 or 95 ibus for tenfidy and as i mentioned the brew seemed very bitter to me when fresh a few years ago ob currently lists the ibus as 65
5040,Ten FIDY,4.25,2022 version  12 oz can into a snifter at 50 big tight brown head forms over the dense dark elixir smell is stone fruit cacao anise coffee dark roast malt taste is the same as the nose but somehow it seems the flavor profile changed from previous cannings its lacking  fullness and anticipated bitterness feel for this batch is less oily and thinner uptight carbonation overall an american stout classic thats always a treat
5041,Country Club Malt Liquor,1.24,if this bottle has a genie hes a greasy extrovert of a genie probably wearing lots of bling and parachute pants  long ago i helped a stranger who was struggling to unload some heavy items from her car afterward she thanked me by handing me a can of country club chilled in a cooler in her trunk this is how an 80s gas station tastes i havent seen it again but i recall it vividly even now wet dog corn and alcohol with a modest armada of grit afloat astounding it did have a nice sort of metallic can note to be fair  if i see it again im gonna try it just to remind myself of the benchmark nothing  not coors not keystone nothing  could be as quintessentially awful the label is a perfect predictor of everything inside if they stop making country club there will still be plenty left unsold in the gas stations of 2237
5042,Country Club Malt Liquor,5,theres nothing like a nice classy country club 40oz in the morning before work during work after work and after a nice classy 40oz of country club heck im country clubbed up right now if i do say so myself the relaxing crips taste the smooth feel down my throat the nice refreshing smell and that beautiful gold and white logo is enough for me to responsibly enjoy at least five country clubs a day 55 good beer
5043,Country Club Malt Liquor,2.49,i remember this one from back in the day and found it a rare find around here at a backwoods convenience store i just had to try it again malt liquors were first marketed to white men back in the 1960s believe it or not and my grandpa bennett would always crack open an 8oz country club or two after work my mom reportedly gave him holy hell when he was caught giving me a few sips as an 18month old i guess that he was just checking to see if the irish parts of my body ie those that are involved in processing alcohol intake were working properly and thus my ghetto taste in beers apparently anyway i was not too impressed overall it was flat and cornytasting with a weird psuedometallic aftertaste as i bought cans i cant blame any skunking for the less than par experience still i will give it the benefit of the doubt the six i bought could have been sitting in the cooler for years wouldnt try it again though
5044,Country Club Malt Liquor,2.24,40oz clear glass bottle with a branded screwtop no abv listed on the label americas premium malt liquor  pours a clear pale copper body with a good 3 fingers worth of offwhite foam sitting atop  aroma yields pale malt and cheap corn lending this some sweetness but seemingly not too much  taste is of pale malt and a bit of cheap corn adjunct which isnt bad when coupled with the smooth wet light to mediumbodied mouthfeel i always fear budget malt liquors will be syrupy and sticky but this avoids that  drinkable albeit forgettable inoffensive fare i doubt ill ever try it again unless im after a cheap buzz more insipid than anything else  d 218  not recommended   lucked into another clear 40oz bottle of this pricetag reads 300 usd the white and gold label design looks like something out of the reagan era  pours three fingers78ish cm worth of offwhite foam frothy and billowing i cant knock it and the retention is pretty nice at 6 minutes body is a clear thin watery dark urine colour no visible yeast or sediment its obviously filtered  aroma brings notes of creamed corn and inoffensive pilsner malt along with a cheap grassy hop character diacetyl and dms are indicated and it seems too sweet more of a grainy aroma would be nice average aromatic intensity  taste is creamed corn dms offflavour and pilsner malts with some cheap syrupy sweetness dragging it down too sweet though not egregiously so and ive had more syrupy more thick malt liquors obviously its unrefreshing but its creamy softness on the palate warrants commendation smooth and wet and not as overcarbonated as many budget malt liquors  overall its an inoffensive brew that drinks best at colder temperatures and will satisfy casual drinkers after a cheap buzz i liked it better this time around than when i initially had it i imagine these clear bottles sitting around in seedy brooklyn bodegas are at high risk for being lightstruck not a terrible beer but i cant recommend it even at this budget tier see ballantine xxx for a more worthwhile choice for budget drinkers  high d 224  not recommended
5045,Country Club Malt Liquor,2.53,when you drop that beer in the return slot the next day thats the appearance sweet corn aroma nod bad for what it is  woof this gives the big fusel alcohol feels not even that strong but it amps it up on your breath its some high bitterness low hops high alcohol corn malt bill type of malt liquor but without the punch even though its mouthfeel kinda makes you think maybe otherwise
5046,Country Club Malt Liquor,3.06,i am a gross fat monster and so ive been looking for country club for years  i read somewhere once that it was the first highish abv beer that was directly marketed a malt liquor and ive come across more than a few old print ads showing fiftiesera frat boys pouring this stuff out of what look like pudding cans while coeds stumble in the background it would be another decade plus until ads came along that were brazen enough to directly implicate malt liquor with date rape thanks billy dee williams but we still got country club to thank for that trend needless to say this beer has long been on my musttry list  forties were just sitting at the bottom of the cooler in some gas station in the middle of upstate new york i jokingly told the clerk that i thought they stopped making it in the 70s he said they might have considering how poorly they sold at this particular location so that didnt bode too well for its freshness  untwisting the cap however i pick up only a faint whiff of skunk which is actually kinda complimentary in a weird way some green bottle euro saisons milk this effect quite well the skunk is almost exclusively aromatic however as the flavor is neigh indistinguishable from mickeys trust me ive drank a lot of mickeys and this is just a skunked mickeys  which isnt bad in my book even if its not exactly good i wouldnt drink mickeys so goddamn often if i truly disliked its flavor its not for beer geeks yeah but as a malt liquor served in 40s it gets the job done and is absolutely inoffensive
5047,Country Club Malt Liquor,3.23,i had been seeking this out for a long time i found it at a liquor store in waltham ma one summer day in 2012 it was found in the customary 40 ounce bottle just sitting there with a gaggle of other 40s as if to scream out take me home i bought it and took it to where i was staying i cracked open the bottle to find wafts of skunk but these skunky scents did not deter me from enjoying this malt the taste was something else like a classic malt liquor should taste sweet malts and a hint of adjunct  i was able to consume the club overall id have this again since that day however i have been unable to find it s though the beer gods seem to have said only once

5055,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.87,12oz bottle into a teku 2002 vintage so 21 years old mouth is watering already  black body deep red wine when held up to the light loose bubbly head doesnt last long  aroma beyond enticing molasses brown sugar dark fruit  on tasting just wow sweet with raisin plum molasses brown sugar but this is not cloying at all incredibly smooth  mouth just about medium it seems a little thinner than you would like but i swear it gets thicker as it rolls around the tongue  finish is warming not a trace of alcohol harshness sweet but again not cloying the abv is there of course but you really dont notice it among the flavors  a magnificent beer one of the best ive ever had
5056,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.53,this is based off a bottle i had in 2023 which was brewed in 2005 l  looks like typical dark ale muddy and cant see light through s  smells richly of brown sugar and caramel complex not excessively sweet t  tastes sweet and caramely in a familiar way but complex to a point which makes it hard to describe f  no carbonation flat substance seems to be drawn from the sweetness and the alcohol content  in general when i popped this beer i didnt quite know what to expect the flavor is amazing this is a great aged ale and i know i will be consuming plenty of jw lees harvest limited what a cool concept

5058,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.73,drunk overlooking the ocean on the fatherinlaws deck in january 2023 after having received it way back in february 2022 from turkeysdrinkbeer the view and the alcohol might have gotten to me so strap in for the review  l pours a rusty orangebrown with little to no head but what does hang around is bright white a slow languorous stream of carbonation threads its way up the glass around lazy suspended sediment that the sediment is there at all is due to my inattention while pouring the beer is 6 years old as i pour it and i should have been more on my game that all said the beer screams barleywine it looks thick it looks rich it looks like it wants a fire and a pair of wolfhounds at my feet while i drink it  a it smells like an old english farmhouse there are years in the carpet pipe tobacco in the air coal dust by the back door and age seeping deep into everything theres a strong umami scent  redolent of crushed beetles soy sauce and oxidation theres booze and old sherry old enough that the liquid has begun to crystalise in the bottom of the bottle theres marmalade thick and bursting with peel and sitting beside the jar of marmite this is comfort and warmth cold nights warm fires and old old tweed jackets  t first blush is sweet malt quickly gaining an umami edge before the marmalade washes over the tongue theres an earthy woody bitterness that never stretches itself beyond mild and stays away from anything resembling a new word hop booze follows mild at first building as it warms and then softens out theres a whiskey note right at the end as the beer thins after the swallow and a nice warmth in the throat and stomach everything works in harmony its not as loud and proud as the nose but it perfectly fits the aural scene and the subtle differences and softening of the taste work brilliantly after the buildup  m its as thick as it looks in the glass if ever a beer needed a spoon  fine old silverware if it please mlord  this one is it carbonation is an afterthought the beer rolls over the tongue with almost no carbonic prickle and leaves only the slightest calling card on the way down  o this beer is the perfect synergy of nose tongue and eyes it looks like a barleywine smells like a barleywine and sure tastes like a barleywine all of those elements build on each other and its the evocative nature of that relationship the building of a sensory pyramid that far outstretches its foundations that make this beer so good its important to understand this is an english barleywine  there are no screaming hops no facemelting bitterness instead there is malt shoved proudly front and centre and a nod to classic english condiments lifestyles past and times slower drink this beer whenever you see it  cheers 169
5059,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.91,found a 1997 vintage in our beer fridge we have no idea where it came from poured with no head dark mahogany brown in color as smooth as can be no alcohol burn n the after taste heavy toffee  dark sweet cherry notes just exquisite im not a beer judge so my ratings for attributes are really useless i love it thats all i know
5060,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.2,bottle of 2011 vintage pours a very deep brown some sediment floaties that settle to the bottom and just a bit of carbonation that settles to a ring initial smells of brandy and booze repeated smells of apple cider vinegar and some wood taste is much sweeter than the smell very fruity barleywine mostly apricot and stone fruit slight wood and a bready finish very surprised by this smooth abv at 115 its worth sipping to unlock more subtle notes of tobacco and leather  while i wouldnt run out and get more i wouldnt mind trying a fresher vintage to see how it stacks up cheers

5063,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),5,theyve upped the abv in my bottle of 750mls now at 125 typical barley wine smell heady funky quite sharp at first then mouthfeel is excellent crisp but also rounded i am quite sorry that i opened this yet can only get better have another bottlegonna save it

5065,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),3.62,2015 canning 84 oz can consumed at cellar temperature 55  guesstimate only but a bit warmer if anything  appearance is dark orange toward brown slightly hazy with sparse carbonation very short offwhite fizzy head with near zero retention the head is completely gone with just a thin ring before i can put the camera down and even this ring is gone before i can take a sip leaving a tealike appearance no lacing  fruity aroma apple caramel toffee figs brandy quite nice  the taste is a bit harsh perhaps a 2015 is too young citrus rind alcohol tobacco leather boozy the citrus rind harshness lends a bit of bitterness and the tobacco earthiness is not a good counterbalance the fruitiness other than the rind has not made an appearance the alcohol warms my mouth and throat in the finish and aftertaste with the tobaccorind lingering  mouth feel has a moderate body and flat feel no carbonation  overall vastly disappointing especially given the reputation and price at just under 1oz as i noted above perhaps more age will mellow out the harshness i regret buying two the other one will remain in the cellar for more years both to allow it to hopefully mellow out and because it will not be at the top of my list to try again

5071,Traquair Jacobite,4.4,been a damn minute since i have had this beer maybe a decade to be honest one of those beers i tried in the very beginning of getting into craft beer excited to see what i think with some experience now  a very dark brown cola body when poured from the stubby 500ml bottle into a becher glass a nice foamy cap up to a finger with a very light tan off white hue small sheets of thin lacing  s rich and sweet dark dried fruits are bright and intense with raisin prune and especially plum coming to mind definitely picking up a touch of herbal coriander as well as a hint of orange peel molasses brown sugar toffee nuttiness pear caramel berry jam and a hint of smoke  t just ground up some coriander the other day and it is not exactly strong but certainly a featured prominent flavor atop the rich dark grains and the dried dark fruits from the ferment the malt profile is diverse with toasty nutty bready grainy slight cocoa light roast caramel molasses and a touch of smoky notes plums are bright and are joined by notes of raisin and prune pear comes to mind again  mf medium bodied overall with a foamy and slightly creamy texture the carbonation is at a moderate level and it has a smooth soft feel to it ends with a spice bitterness lingering  coriander a ton of dark bright fruits and a great malt profile brings me back a long ways and still a classic that really is quite unique
5072,Traquair Jacobite,4.1,poured this beer from a bottle purchased at a dallas bottle shop into a tulip glass dark brown color with a reddish hue initially a beige head and some lacing caramel and oak smell and taste pleasant warming beer but expected it to be a bit meatier a nice beer and i bet it is better fresh on tap
5073,Traquair Jacobite,4.12,review 1514  i had no idea that i did not review this beer i have drunk this beer several years ago do not remember much about it the beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass the pour of the beer created a light tan onefinger head the head is creamy and foamy with excellent retention the slow dissipation on the glass left a lot of lacing on the glass the color of the beer is srm 24 dark brown with ruby red hues this beer is opaque overall this beer is above average for this style  the aromas in the beer are caramel roasted malts toffee malty sweetness subtle peat a touch of smoke a smidge of maillard floral oranges and some earthiness  the flavors in the beer start with a light caramel then segway into peat with oranges and earthiness next i taste some maillard floral toffee dried raisins molasses and herbal  the mouthfeel is coating and warming  the body of the beer is medium mediumplus carbonation and a mediumplus finish  at times i felt the malts thin out it is a malty beer with expressive flavors it is a solid scotch ale i wanted a beefier malt profile to make it heavier
5074,Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.71,all high abv porters should be bourbon barrel aged in my opinion this one is and well done super dark in color with a light brown head nose is bourbon and caramel taste is like toasted cane sugar and caramel the slight burn from the abv is not overwhelming yet has a bit of hang around power the feel goes all the way down the esophagus

5079,Hommage,3.7,a pours purpleblood red color a small pinkwhite head forms initially though that recedes quickly with little lace that color is really stunning though s aromatic and tart berries and cherries up front and center with an unmistakable earthy funk there is a bit of oak and vanilla here as well a really pungent and sharp aroma that i enjoy t oh boy that sweet tart berrycherry mix is there which becomes super acidic and sour that funk light oak and vanilla is there as well which tries to help balance though that acidic sourness becomes a little to much and makes this unbalanced for me mo a medium body that has a nice crisp bite really well carbonated definitely some sweetness as would be expected but finishes with a dry bite as well pretty classic for the style but still its slow going that acidity takes over to much  i love 3 fonteinen and this is a good example of the style for sure though it is unbalanced for me there are other fruit lambics that i prefer over this but still you have to acknowledge that this is exactly what they wanted to make and i do enjoy it just not love it as much as others in the style or even others from this same brewery i would recommend this if you enjoy intense flavors especially sour acidic cherries
5080,Hommage,5,blend no 71 season 1819 perfect just perfect
5081,Racer X Double IPA,3.96,a crystal clear copper in color 1 finger finely pored light tan head that receded to a wispy cap nice rings of lace  s very ripe pineapple  t follows the nose up front and at the end in the middle theres an added floral component mild bitterness on the finish  m medium to full bodied moderate carbonation moderately dry finish  o a little too sweet for my taste

5086,Stroh's,3.01,okay v light
5087,Stroh's,2.53,if you are not strohs then you are not drinking cheap beer this is my go to when im going out to a party and am looking to crush a bunch very watered down just something to drink on a social occasion
5088,Stroh's,3.5,i get what others are saying for the style this really isnt bad its real cheap at least but definitely not piss water as some would say craft breweries have packaged and shipped way worse products that this one
5089,Stroh's,3.64,i will always be confused when fellow reviewers give these adjuncts abnormally low reviews you are comparing against the style not what you think makes you look like a cool beer reviewer this particular brew is perfectly fine for the style
5090,Stroh's,2.74,this beer was the big boy on the block when i was in high school and first time in the service drank a lot of this at that time and liked it now not so much but it would be better than nothing i guess
5091,Stroh's,3.93,to me tastes similar to pabst in my book still a light and easy drinking beer
5092,Stroh's,3.85,has a nice slight floral hop to it similar to hamms not in taste but in character its not your average mass produced aal that tastes like wet cardboard but has a flavor that makes you look forward to the next can
5093,Stroh's,2.79,12oz can enjoy by date oct 24 2022 into a wooden shoe wooden shoe l pours bright light yellow with big bubbles and a lightly soapy bright white head that falls fast carbo retention is fair light lacing s light malts grains gentle white bread light caramel t subtle bitterness light corn grains a light  pleasant grassy overtone f relatively soft  light bodied mouthfeel with a clean medium length moderately drying finish o as an iconic american adjunct lager this beer has a nice balance overall it is lighter in nature slightly crisp and is alright in its style drink it ice cold very crushable
5094,Stroh's,3.48,poured out of a 12 oz can into one of my pint glasses this beer pours a clear pale medium golden color with lots of little bubbles fairly rapidly and continually rising to the beers surface has a fluffy looking white head thats initially well over an inch thick when first served after a few minutes it settles to a thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some nice cluster swirls of film layer surface foam good lacing here too not a bad look at all aromas of some bready malts some herbal and floral notes that i assume are the hop aroma the taste is pretty much the same w some bready malts followed by floral maybe some slight hints of corn and or rice and herbal notes w slight hop bitterness no bad tasting adjunct offflavors or awful metallic offflavors here the flavor while not great or even that prevalent by any means seems to suit this beer just fine for what it is certainly one of the better tasting beers of this style that ive had it doesnt even start tasting terrible as it warms up a bit has a crisp yet smooth light bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation easy to drink in the way a beer of this style should be has a clean finish and decent aftertaste not too shabby but not great to me either this beer is exactly what it is trying to be refreshing on a warm summer night here in cleveland oh  eric
5095,Stroh's,3.33,not the strohs of old i was disappointed in how it had changed i have been looking for this brand for about a decade and finally found it an hour from home once past my disappointment i rated the beer i was drinking nothing much different from any of the others in its class it is a good drinkable beer when you want just a plain beer there are plenty of others in this category that i dont have to travel to get i will still buy it when i see it for a change in the fridge it does have a little uniqueness but not enough to go out of my way for
5096,Coconut B-Bomb,4.6,2017 vintage still plenty of coconut flavor pours with a brown head and mild lacing scents of bourbon coconut cocoa and caramel all of which carry over to the taste hints of dark fruit on the under current medium bodied easy sipper subtle booze presence quite enjoyable
5097,Coconut B-Bomb,4.09,this is for the 2019 release sent to me by colts9016 as part of nbw bif 15 poured nearly black which for a winter ale was a bit surprising still capped with the brown head it looked quite enticing the aroma was bourbon and thats about it the taste followed there was some roasted malts that came through but i couldnt find any coconut in the mix not sure if if it aged out or something but i never found it the feel was excellent for the flavors bourbon is a sipping drink you know i am glad to have tried this but would like to revisit a fresher version if possible
5098,Coconut B-Bomb,4.35,bottle poured a deep brown color ale with a large brown foamy head aroma of strong coconut notes with some sweet caramelized malt and chocolate notes is quite enticing taste is a mix of strong coconut notes with sweet caramelized malt notes and some chocolate notes body is full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol notes very enjoyable if you like coconut

5101,Busch Light,4.31,if youre going to rate it rate it for what it is a light lager it is by far my favorite of such
5102,Busch Light,2.32,ol busch light great for bbqs beach parties beer pong etc basically the perfect budget light lager best kept very cold and in the can because its not much to look at
5103,Busch Light,1.66,12 ounce can into a thick plastic cup pours straw yellow quickly fading foam wet grain smell but not much elsetaste is same as mouthfeel light watery refreshing perfect for summer bbqcookouts or after mowing the lawn best drunk ice cold out of the cooler i know a lot of beer drinkers look down on ab miller coors ect but lets be honest not everyone can afford the snooty nose in the air craft types promoted on websites such as this we drink what we can afford and is a good deal i was able to get a 15 pack for around 10 dollars is bl the best no but it isnt the worst either
5104,Busch Light,4,i have a daughter in college a son who just graduated hs and wants to go to a technical college i dont have the money to spend on craft beer like i used to so a 30 pack of busch light will do easy drinking decent taste great for pounding when mowing the grass or bbqing or on these 100 degree sotex days since i dont have the money to be the beer snob i once wasbusch is one of my cheaper go to beers
5105,Busch Light,1.98,25fl oz can from albertsons go big or go home i should have gone home im not sure you could get any paler for the body of this brew one finger head disappears before the pour is finished aroma is very weak grains taste introduces notes of apple  corn and grains watery consistency watery everything not horrible just not much of anything except the water part it does quench a thirst however  just like water
5106,Busch Light,2.84,it was almost as bad as bud light but not quite there i dont care for this one someone gave it to me is the only reason i drank it checked the date it was still current so i have found a beer that i dont care for much i wont buy it mild taste but hardly any flavor in that taste
5107,Busch Light,1.74,poured from a 12 ounce can into a shaker pint glass the best by date is jun23  appearance pours a clear light golden color with onefinger white head that quickly dissipated until only a ring of small bubbles remained around the rim appears to be lightly carbonated minimal lacing on the glass  smell light cornbread thats about all i got from it pretty one dimensional  taste the taste sadly followed the nose kind of watery and bland light taste of sweet cornbread and the hops are nearly imperceptible its not complex this is a one trick pony and its not a very imaginative trick  palate this is the worst score i have ever given in this category it was watery and lacked an appropriate level of carbonation most unpleasant  overall this is a terrible beer if i was invited fishing with a buddy and this is all he had for us to drink i would politely and reluctantly drink it but next time ill bring the beer ab gets a lot of hate and its mostly deserved the flagship budweiser is a decent beer but busch light is pure garbage
5108,Busch Light,2.65,25oz can best by july 2nd 2023  on the pour it was fizzy one second then completely headless the next honestly looks like a cider or sparkling apple juice  aroma is better than expected and largely clean other than a huge green apple acetaldehyde presence super light in aroma with a light watered down grain finish but not pissy smelling like natty or keystone  taste is again higher quality than its cousins and competitors but still incredibly watery and lacking in flavor tastes like a decent lager that was watered down severely finish is sweet barley and corn  feel is the closest to beer flavored seltzer i think ive gotten other than michelob ultra but this is super chuggable fizzy and almost not there other than immense carbonation despite that the finish is quite long feels better when ice cold but has a crisp finish  overall this is the definition of halfway decent and not quite in a good way although better than most of the macro light lagers especially for the price point the things i like about it just dont hit with enough force almost forcing you to chug the beer for any sort of satisfaction
5109,Busch Light,1.25,about as bland and bad as it can get when it comes to light beers i kinda wanna try regular busch beer just to see if its any better
5110,Busch Light,1,its not a beer for flavori dont understand why people dont drink more pabst this is for people who chug beer to get drunk and not enjoy the flavor i wish more people would try pabst instead of this
5111,Busch Light,2.93,picked up only to compare against regular busch hard to tell the difference looks the same in the glass tastes the same too its not a bad beer but its quite confusing having this and the original side by side in stores
5112,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,3.96,1993 vintage  happy new year ba this beer is officially 30 years old and i cant think of a better occasion to crack it open i picked this one up from oec in late 2021 who had been cellaring it since 2004 so even for being 30 years old its probably kept in pretty good condition over the years lets see how the oldest beer ive ever had is  pours still and slightly cloudy dark reddish brown no head or lacing to be found  honestly on smell alone you could tell me this is only about 15 years old and id believe you definitely oxidized but i was expecting much worse im picking up on aromas of prune burnt caramel port wine cacao nib black licorice molasses acrid coffee and a touch of soy sauce  it definitely shows its age much more in taste but its honestly better than i expected going into it and is still just as enjoyable as the aroma suggested on the front end of the sip im tasting black cherry oxidized sherry caramel light coffee fig and molasses the swallow brings notes of black cherry port wine soy sauce molasses acrid coffee cocoa powder light prune and burnt caramel  a medium body and no carbonation results in a watery yet boozy beer finishes mostly dry with a significant roast  im genuinely shocked at how much i find myself enjoying this one i picked it up out of sheer curiosity having a beer older than myself just seemed like a novel idea obviously its well past its prime but it still held up nicely after 30 years
5113,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.41,2012 vintage  dark espresso burnt black coffee dark toffee baking chocolate black licorice soy sauce dark fruits fig prune pear skin cigar leaf with mild earthy hops feels medium bodied smooth carbonation overall a nice english imperial stout
5114,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.49,275ml bottle born on 8162012 poured into a snifter at 55 degrees f l  muddy and oily with no head s  molasses fig raisin t  follows the nose molasses fig raisin leaving a sweetness on the finish f  thick mouthfeel with no carbonation o  great beer at almost 10 years old the flavors are still magnificent this is a beer thats known to age very well
5115,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,3.59,2013 vintage inky black no head aromas of chocolate espresso burnt sugar prunes and raisins bitter chocolate burnt sugar prunes kinda like a ruby port with some dark chocolate mixed in heavy bodied next to no carbonation i liked this beer better when i had it fresh
5116,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.12,250 ml bottle 2013 vintage poured 10 cl into a pilsner glass for this review the rest i drank from the bottle a practice men have evidently abandoned in late stage capitalist dystopia l this one is attractive opaque black wisps of a tan head that lasted slightly longer than a typical ba reviewer in nicole kidmans bed s i read the bottle dont read the bottle if you have never tried a beer but might want to review it i have my nose in this glass searching for the purported pear notes and ignoring what i do pick up its sharp and rich good cacao roasted malt raisins i can smell that 10 t oh this is good more bitterness than i expected but not in a gross ipa way more like bakers chocolate a little coffee  dark roast not espresso raisins are present but its not sweet f never know what to say here not thin but definitely not the heaviness i expected almost zero carbonation smooth overall i am impressed added it to a drizly order on a whim glad i did
5117,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,3.42,shared 250 ml bottle brewed by courage 1992 abv is 100 black colour no head nor carbonation aroma of roast malts molasses and dark dried fruits oxidised of course but not bad sweet flavour with the same elements no acidity
5118,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.42, 112220  bottle to snifter 2012 vintage though i just picked this up a few weeks ago so god knows where it has been  look thick black full look small tan head fades quickly but reforms admirably aroma super pungent very nice mix of cocoa fig dates prunes roasted malt red wine taste roasted malt comes through more here than the dark fruit notes but they are also present feel super smooth a little flat but to be expected with an 8 year old thick stout  very impressed this is a beautiful and simple beer from a time before pastry stouts and hopbombs and super sours not to disparage those other things too much but you have to respect getting so much flavor and mileage from a simple recipe  
5119,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,3.99,vintage double pack from jungle jims 2013 and 2012 vintage poured into snifter pitch dark no head at all dominant boozy smell with coffee notes i am tasting dark chocolate and coffee like it
5120,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4,1977 vintage dark medium body espresso bakers chocolate raisin little bit of oxidation from the years but can definitely see its former greatness
5121,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.5,2012 vintage 066482 tan head with some lace dark brownblack color  this is a master crafted ris dark chocolate cocoa figs raisins molasses massive port notes other dark dried fruits caramel bakers chocolate smooth silky easy drinking full bodied with a great feel perfect level of carbonation id rather have this over pastry stouts any day amazed with this bottle
5122,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.16,pale yellow thick and juicy looking so hazy you cant see through it topped with one finger of fast dissipating white head the smell is of orange citrus a hint of pine certainly not as pronounced as i was expecting the taste is very fruity and juicy like a perfect refined orange juice with a hint of dank ness and an abundance of tropical notes but all very muted light and foamy feeling body very smooth ive been anticipating this brew for a long time i got it at beer hub in waynesville north carolina and im drinking in maggie valley august 12 2023 i must admit the hype around this set my expectations quite high and it is a great beer however not nearly as perfect as i was expecting but certainly worth searching out
5123,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.29,poured the requisite opaque yellow orange with a growing manilla colored head no floaties to be seen the aroma is lost on my covid damaged nose stupid covid the taste was a tale of two beers at first it was magnificent with citrus notes and a hint of piney pith im thinking this is awesome then i let it warm up a bit and it shifted to a dryer more pithy taste no idea why it was still really good just not magnificent the feel is solid smooth and no chunks of anything easy quaffing oa good nay great dipa and i may get more or i might just stick with regular king sue
5124,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.05,draught pour at champps americana in brookfield wi this was a bit of a letdown  a solid dneipa for sure but it is very green not quite vegetal but definitely not an improvement over the original i have no idea how old the key is but assuming it is very fresh perhaps the beer improves after a couple of weeks
5125,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.56,one of the best beers ive had
5126,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.5,looka beautiful vibrant light orange with a ton of carbonation and white foamy head a proper looking unfiltered dipa smella burst of orange pineapple pink grapefruit mango and all types of floral aromas a dank grass is fielded by the dry hopping imbibing a pungency tasteorange bitter pineapple express with the dank hoppy bitterness with the dry component i believed caused by the dry hopping feelan astringent juice feel with a sticky convergence of foam  great carbonation launching a good fullness overallthis beer i tried today for the 4th time is one of the elite beers i get to try sometimes a beer just hits you and says wow and this for me has that quality king sue its close cousin i felt the first time i had that too if you see this beer and like unfiltered dipas you would be a fool not to pick this up i saw in one of the other reviews had this at 25 before tax and deposit and that is steep but damn this beer is nice  i paid 20 before tax and deposit but i was on the lookout for this to try for a while and i am not disappointed
5127,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.54,as advertised  a more vibrant flavorful version of king sue expensive at 2495 for 4 flavorful but the alcohol remains under control prefer the ddh version  would like to do again
5128,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.35,a  pours a hazy golden orange with a fizzy one finger head the fades fast leaving some light soapy lacing  s  aroma is orange pineapple and grapefruit  t  the taste is orange grapefruit peel pineapple and a big kick of piney hops  m  medium body with medium carbonation crisp mouthfeel with a soft fizzy finish  o  really solid but maybe a tad bit overrated
5129,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,3.95,canned 52223 milky yellow with brief tight white head poor cap retention thin ring a few spots of lace overripe fruit odd cryo nose taste is overripe citrus and tropical fruit  orange and pineapple mouthfeel is astringent and full of hop burn medium body light carbonation overall for me this beer is unfiltered crapim shocked at how much i dont like this highly rated beer
5130,Hazy Rays,3.13,oh darn  lawsons usualy sets the bar very very high but this one ws a big miss for mesos and ls so good this is the opposite thin almost tasteless where is the juicy this one needs a redo
5131,Hazy Rays,3.77,agree with others that this from a fave rare brewer getting bigger is alsoran lightweight ne ipa a totally hazy pour of weak yellow color and a 4 due to lasting lacing head s agree that its citrus and grapefruit meets pine with some dankness t follows aroma adds some spicyiness and perfume reduction not my cup of tea f chalky drinks big for modest abv then juicy finale o midpack but original  and aside from the bait and switch on appearance the palate is also more spicy and bitter than your typical new england ipa especially since the can also describes it as juicy while it does have citrus qualities its more dank and piney  itd be fine if they simply did what they do with sip of sunshine and called it a fucking ipa without any other promises but this doesnt even hit their own mark let alone the national standard for the style today
5132,Hazy Rays,4.38,a really nice and flavorful light hazy ipa great for summer drinking and very poundable not bitter at all decent body for a light beer as well highly recommend
5133,Hazy Rays,4.75,superbangin hazy pale perfect balance of light crisp malt deep hop presence gentle pale the feel is pretty effervescent nice sweetness mid palate but wraps up very dry this is a very unique pretty flawless brew fills a great niche of sessionable juicy hazy but extremely clean yum
5134,Hazy Rays,3.54,mostly clear dull gold with a tall and puffy white foam head cmon man you cant straight up name the beer hazy and have it be this clear especially from vermont in this day and age  and aside from the bait and switch on appearance the palate is also more spicy and bitter than your typical new england ipa especially since the can also describes it as juicy while it does have citrus qualities its more dank and piney  itd be fine if they simply did what they do with sip of sunshine and called it a fucking ipa without any other promises but this doesnt even hit their own mark let alone the national standard for the style today
5135,Hazy Rays,4.18,tasty new offering done right had a real piney element to it without losing some of that citra hop flavor and fruitiness its a hair sweet in my opinion but definitely not disruptive win  one bullshit thing that i felt betrayed on was the can it was just a purple plastic wrapper around a scragg mountain pills can
5136,Hazy Rays,3.34,12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for 299 pkg 02jun23 so this is like 70 days old 2 months plus  look it is quite hazy but not super turbid or opaque looking its still somewhat translucent its yellowish orange in color leaning towards yellowish it looks a lot like white grapefruit juice there was about a finger of whitish head that dissipated to ring around the glass  smell tons of grapefruit on the nose after swirling the glass i get some medicinal notes perhaps a bit chalky and reminiscent of chewable vitamins this sounds weird but i also get a subtle butterscotchflavored hard candy note very much like a brachs or dum dum lollipop some earthy and grassy notes on the finish the nose is actually relatively closed and not so expressive  taste interesting theres something bizarre about this beer up front it tastes like a lot of other hoppy citrusforward beers lots of grapefruit character but then you swallow it and theres almost no bitterness and it almost feels like you are drinking a soda its really weird and i just dont get it the finish is very short and thin  feel highly carbonated with a carbonic acid  soda or seltzerlike feel the finish is very short and thin i would say that this beer is light to medium bodied  overall this beer fell short for me overall ive been pretty impressed with lawsons finest liquids but this offering is not my cup of tea im not sure if they are trying to cater to a different kind of audience or what but i would say that this beer does not appeal to old school beer drinkers and i dont think that it really appeals to new school beer drinkers either so thats what im saying when i mention i dont know who their target audience is with this one oh well
5137,Hazy Rays,4.03,light hazy straw color with no head or lace has a strong pleasant aroma of citrus lemon and flowery hops taste follows the smell balanced citrus and hops very easy drinking and crisp feel this beer is fine but prefer little sip and sip of sunshine from this breweryfar bolder taste profile
5138,Hazy Rays,3.81,a little hazy but definitely bright gold with a nice white cap of foam nose is fragrant citrus on the palate this beer is refreshing with an orange tang and a clean dry finish at 53 abv this can work as a session beer throw in a warm summer dayperfection
5139,Hazy Rays,4,lawsons finest liquids hazy rays 1 pint can pkg 02may23 182018 and sampled on 15jul23 12994pk  total wine  more cherry hill nj  notes via stream of consciousness its surprisingly light in color just a straw gold which leads me to believe its got a lot of oats in it whats the strength on this one its just 53 3 more than budweiser which explains a lot as well its definitely hazy and maybe even cloudy like a hefeweizen the head is a fingers width of bright white foam that doesnt look like its going to hold up any better than most in the nose its got some hop resins to it and fruity notes of orange and mango the flavor delivers a fairly light maltiness that does include a bit of oat but im not clearly getting wheat the hops remain mainly orangelike in character with some additional mango and apricot its not a bold beer in any way and keeping with that the bitterness is limited in the mouth its lightmedium in body and silky smooth across the palate this is an easy drinking beer thats got a lot more character to it than most beers of 5 and although it wont knock founders all day ipa off my top rack as a session ipa its just 47 and hoppier its a fairly good option review 8684
5140,Samuel Adams Just The Haze,3.86,pours appropriately hazy golden amber beer good head retention for a na big hoppy nose offering tropical fruity notes right on style pretty darn good taste as well maybe just a touch of graininess i wouldnt expect in a normal beer but otherwise its square on a ne ipa style good body with lots of carbonation nas have really improved the last few years last time i was drinking them regularly was about a decade ago and the choices of good ones were slim now theres a wealth of choices
5141,Samuel Adams Just The Haze,4.5,a delicious beer for a summer afternoon a little bite notes of citrus good mouthfeel as any decent hazy ipa it walks that line between bitter hops and citrus tart it seems a little more carbonated than most beers too which adds to the experience of drinking it a very worthy contender in the na scene
5142,Samuel Adams Just The Haze,4.25,can white head with lace hazy orange gold color  this is one of the better nas out there this tastes like a real hazy ipa juicy and tropical lots of melon peach and mango some orange and pineapple too hoppy light bitterness super drinkable
5143,Samuel Adams Just The Haze,3,nonalcoholic beer is an oxymoron but i was curious and this is my first foray into the genre it looks like beer with its hazy body  modest white head it does have a slight hoppy aroma there is some hop flavor but thats it no wheat no malt no complexity feels like a soda overall its just hop flavored soda water
5144,Samuel Adams Just The Haze,3.95,seems a little too carbonated thats all overall they did a pretty good job i would drink it again just nice to have an ipa especially a hazy one i dont drink alcohol anymore so this is a real treat to know these beers are out there now
5145,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.9,171 fantastic
5146,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.24,2020 vintage a very solid and canonical example of the style perhaps the prototype of what a bourbon barrel aged ris should emulate i find the style to be a little bit on the roasty herbaceous side and this was no exception the barrel aging did smooth things out quite a bit in the flavors although i was surprised that the mouthfeel wasnt fuller overall very glad to finally try this but i definitely prefer beyond good and evil and their other sweeter bba stouts  85100
5147,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.56,bottled 1102020 consumed 10282022  i just got a job offer today so i needed to pull something out of my cellar to celebrate i traded a bottle of eh taylor small batch for this bottle of beer so lets see if it lives up the hype and 50 i paid for the bourbon it does look spot on amazing its super thick but not syrupy in a bad way this is the kind of stout that beginners would hate and neck bearded beer nerds crave on the tongue its super full and soft absolutely perfect for the style for me im not getting enough on the nose though to wow me i get bourbon and chocolate i smell the typical lovely bitterness of a ris still its lacking in the nose for me drinking it though everything lives up to the hype its less sweet than a typical goose bcs which set the standard for me back in the day i can taste the booziness but in a good way i like high abv stouts where i can taste the alcohol a bit why make a bourbon barrel aged stout if the bourbon isnt front and center whats different and great is that theres also the balance of the base beer theres a lot of plain old ris here take your best like a darkness or expedition and add the bourbon with everything balancing out perfectly the finish is long and toasty like a good cup of coffee a great beer and worth the bourbon at retail
5148,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.87,hands down the best beer ive ever had
5149,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.6,pours a deep black with a thin mochacolored head that dissipates quickly the aroma gives notes of charred oak bourbon dark fruits dark roast coffee and vanilla the flavor is less sharp and more rich with notes of dark chocolate espresso chocolate chip cookie and oaky bourbon and vanilla the flavor lingers well after the sip with rich chocolatey cookie flavors the body is very full and creamy without ever being syrupy leading to a very balanced finish overall a very flavorful and drinkable beer one of my favorite bba stouts i have ever had very well balanced flavor and mouthfeel highly recommended
5150,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.7,uh nearly perfect
5151,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.67,2021 release  jet black with considerable tan head on an aggressive pour smell of bourbon barrel and light char taste is incredibly balanced between barrel and chocolate no burn thicker than i expected on the mouthfeel classic hill world class ba non adjunct stout
5152,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.26,bottled on 1102020 consumed on 1292022  pours an oily midnightblack body capped with a modest finger and a half of dense pale mocha foam great head retention leaves a paperthin veil over an otherwise viscous void along with a large creamy collar and the occasional strand of webby lacing dotted around the walls of the glass  aroma opens to a healthy barrel char with tinges of ashen smoke advancing to black licorice before finding predominant nutty bakers chocolate over the middle dark cocoa is enhanced by subtle caramels as a medley of dark fruits enriches delicately savory tannic qualities in the backdrop through the close  taste brings soft vanillins into black licorice as deep bakers cocoa waves wash over splintery barrel accented with dark fruit esters whipped milk chocolate decadence on the back end finds spent coffee grounds and hints of bourbon underscoring the finish  mouthfeel shows a body on the heavier side of medium and a moderatelow carbonation purely silky in texture with intensely focused consistency advancing to a creamy midpalate engaging a rounded sinewy grit vaguely tannic leanings into the back end are masked by moderate warmth as a subtle dryness evolves through the finish  an honest oldschool display of classic russian imperial stout bittersweetness and borderline acridity composed in masterful flux with a tame and wellintegrated barrel effortless despite these roastier leanings this is another example of hill farmstead at a formulaic peak in composure
5153,Blind Pig,4.03,1 pint 125 fl oz bottle served in a nonic pint glass  this beer pours a clear golden hue it is topped with a couple inches of offwhite head that leaves rings of lacing as i consume  mild resin aroma pine otherwise it smells clean  grapefruit and pine flavor it is mild slightly bitter finish with a little lingering bitterness  medium bodied with a pillowy mouthfeel  solid west coast ipa
5154,Blind Pig,4.25,1725oz bottled 71923 opened 9423 2 finger white head with great retention and full lacing as it recedes to a solid cap golden ipa body with a bit of chill haze aromas of peach melon some pine and lemon vibrant and clean flavors follow very closely to the aroma  lemon peacha little zestier with some citrus rind bitterness bright entry medium body and carbonation solid bitter punch midpalate and to late in the dry finish outstanding
5155,Blind Pig,4.83,peachy hints of malt and bitterness tropical zesty citrus ripe smooth balanced
5156,Blind Pig,4.49,excellent ipa actually prefer it over pliny the elder as it is smoother just a very enjoyable ipa and easily one of the best
5157,Blind Pig,3.68,510 what ml bottled on 032423 and served in a pint glass pours real pale and real foamy super straw yellow color aroma is very fresh but doesnt have a particularly citrusy or piney smell first sip brings a pure flavor of old school american ipa assertively bitter but flavorful with pine sap and spicy wood there is a very little bit of biscuit malt flavor to go along with it too  its pretty cool how pure and wellexecuted this is it deserves to be a classic but not legendary then again i cant even imagine what it would have been like to drink an ipa in 1994
5158,Blind Pig,4.31,look  clear and gold in color white soapy head lacing was spotty smell  citrusy piney grapefruit woody aromatic taste  hoppy grapefruit piney spicy fruity feel  medium light body medium carbonation crisp dry with a light bitter finish overall  tasty brew it was even better as it warmed up a bit the citrusy and fruity flavors came thru even more although this brew was a bit light in the body the hoppy grapefruit piney notes added balance and a nice lingering bitterness i paired her up with pigs three different ones by pink floyd for ultimate satisfaction
5159,Blind Pig,4.02,42723 bottled 32323 sessionable ipa pine citrus crisp  clean good bitterness
5160,#9,3.67,chilled 12 ounce bottle straight up i havent seen 9 in some time thought it was discontinued or something random grab at a total wine in miami no date stamp scared me a little same as i remember  by no means a bad beer no such thing right has an old skool crisp pale ale vibe to it unpretentious and sublime nice to quaff one again
5161,#9,5,i personally love this beer i saw alot of 375 rating which was a shock to me this beer is a classic of the 90s and is still going strong for good reason i am currently sipping one and im 32 years old i remember seeing the cap with the hypnotizing swirl on it and witty sayings in the cap when i was just a kid when i got older i started drinking these and understood why my parents loved them i hope this beer stays around long enough for me to keep enjoying my childhood as weird as that seems with this beer and reading the caps it reminds me of the good times i once had when i was little growing up in the 90s i miss that free spirit attitude everyone had and the beers taste helps me reminisce those awesome years
5162,#9,3.74,this beer pours a clear amber color with a moderate white head the aroma is sweet and yeasty its has a pleasant sweet fruity taste a good session beer
5163,#9,3.91,classic indeed  early gateway beer that i drank the snot out of so many times ton of interesting and titillating flavors combined would love to revisit this one if its still brewed
5164,#9,4.5,not heavy refreshing classic taste
5165,#9,3.75,poured from a 12 oz can from a variety pack pours bronze like with decent foamy head rapidly recedes the fruit and field style threw me off as it tastes more like a standard lager meh
5166,#9,3.92,pours golden yellow with a 12 white head which lasts moderate lacing  aroma is floral caramel light citrus grassy hops  taste is caramel citrus light pine  light to medium body moderate carbonation dry finish  pretty decent pale ale less bitterness than an ipa
5167,Oude Gueuze,3.36,look  orange syrup not head ing lacing smell  very earthy tart citrus grainy slight chemical taste  funky dry earthy grainy feel  medium body light carb slight syrup overall  this must be old and wonder how much better it couldbe young
5168,Oude Gueuze,3.84,127oz corked and caged bottle dating badly smudged but at least 4 years old  looks okay in the glass hazy dull orange body head dissipates very quickly no lacing  somewhat funky on the nose even a little cheesy barest hint of green apple  on tasting a little dry quite sour mild funk more green apple than the nose suggests  mouth barely reaches medium finish a lasting dry sourness spikes of bitterness now and then  overall has its merits but not as good as i was hoping for cork was a bit grubby on the edges perhaps a mild contamination issue
5169,Oude Gueuze,4.25,127oz green corked  caged bottle notched bottled in d 2016 nearly 6 years old poured into a teku glass at fridge temp 6 abv the beer pours mostly bright soft medium amber in color with short lived nearly white head the head recedes to a few scattered bubbles about the perimeter of the glass no lacing the aroma is intense like you can smell it while taking the picture lemon orchard fruit horse blanket funky cheese and vinegar the taste is sour overwhelming so to my palate but i dont generally care for sour beer digging past my initial instinct to quit this bottle immediately i get waves of citrus big vinegar and funky ass bleu cheese mouthfeel is thin bodied highly carbonated and bone dry overall i will capitulate to the ba overall rating of world class for a lambic gueuze and rate it accordingly however i would not serve this to a sworn enemy dying of thirst
5170,Oude Gueuze,4.27,127oz green bottle label has bottling date as d december 2018 cloudy pale amberapricot colored body brief off white head no lacing aroma is leather and grass very fragrant like its body color there is a hint of stone fruit apricot taste is sour with tobacco and leather flavors also some cut hay there is the apricot fruit here the intensity mellows in the aftertaste with a hint of fruit and oak remaining tart mouth feel with a drying sensation very good carbonation somewhat like a sour white wine but still somewhat complex

5173,Oude Gueuze,4.3,blend of 2016 2017 and 2018 lambics so this was likely blended in 2019  new year new beer im very excited to try my first gueuze and planned to open it for new years day 2021 more like new years night at this point lets just jump straight into this  pours a cloudy orange gold with just a thin white cap that quickly fades to a ring and leaves no lacing the carbonation is very visible  a lot of fruit and funk dancing around in the nose i get notes of apricot underripe peach lemon horse blanket sharp oak sweet malt and a small touch of tobacco oddly enough for a beer like this  the flavor evolves quite a bit throughout the sip here what starts off smooth and balanced in sweet and sour turns into a funky dry tartness it starts with notes of lemon white grape crisp but full malt and buttery oak that reminds me of chardonnay the swallow brings notes of sharp oak leather tart and funky apricot apple skin vinegar and a light floral character  a light body pairs with moderate carbonation for a very refreshing drinking experience it feels light than the abv but finishes a touch too sticky  this was a damn good beer and im happy to have tried the style i know theres better ones out there and id love to have more happy new years ba cheers to a better 2021

5175,Natural Ice,2.5,cheap beer for the basement bar good beer for just a beer or two after work etc
5176,Natural Ice,4.91,natty ice should get more credit than it gets its kills best ice and icehouse destroys bud light crisp clean taste smooth 59 abv and 42 carbs 119 for 25 0z compared to bud light 25 oz cans at 249 a win win for me
5177,Natural Ice,3.08,presentation 12 oz can poured into pint glass  look clear golden color head is surprisingly large and lasts longer than expected  smell prominent aromas of grain corn and roasted malt minimal hops aroma  taste strong caramelized malt and grain flavors minimal hops flavor minor citrus aftertaste flavor is light but refreshing and smooth quite tasty  feel smooth and light mouthfeel  overall this beer is better than youd think it would be nothing about it is below average for its segment flavor is more complex than i expected considering its 59 percent alcohol by volume its quite smooth and drinkable id recommend this beer to anyone who likes drinkable american lagers
5178,Natural Ice,3.12,12 oz can poured into a pilsner glass at 43f  pours a clear yellow gold with a 2 finger white head with 1 ring of lacing  initial aroma is general lager smell mostly yeast with a good amount of pineapple as well as some lemon and starting to ferment green apple pretty nice honestly after smelling a few more times i pick specifically that the yeast is a crusty white bread smell any yeasty type thats dusted with flour that you can tear apart after agitating i notice almost a yogurt bacteria strain aroma  initial taste before swallowing is light yeast and maybe biscuity malt this becomes slightly pepperytingly and floral after swallowing it becomes lightly sweet lightly nutty and the peppery floral taste grows stronger and remains in the aftertaste 59 abv but i can actually taste some alcohol  feel is thin but not watery and not super crisp or refreshing additionally the carbonation fades quickly honestly though fairly smooth and i dont dislike it  overall i dont dislike this i didnt love the taste but genuinely its alright i can say that i thought it was very coherent  not likely to buy again more than maybe twice in my life but honestly not bad for the price picked up a single
5179,Natural Ice,1.94,poured from a 25oz can  on a vigorous pour barely two fingers of fizzy white head firm then quickly in under a minute dissipate to essentially no head color is of golden piss  aroma is rough almost metallic from all the apple off flavor going on here smells like beer in the bottom of a trash can  taste follows the aroma with the bright green apple bitterness but i do pick up a touch if grain and adjunct in the back but not much else before becoming accustomed to the flavor it did come off as a bit boozy  feel isnt quite chuggable but i think there may be some fusel alcohols that are just making things sort of harsh not as drinkable as some malt liquors despite the relatively quick finish  overall this isnt great but you can get used to it and it is identifiable as a beer obviously low quality and seems like it could be the base for mikes or some other malt beverage
5180,Natural Ice,3.24,22 smacks for a 30 rack this has a smidge more flavor than your worst beer in the store montucky cold snack also almost doubles it up in alcovolume that is to say its clean cheaper stronger and more flavorful this beer is a winner for what it is multinational budget strong lager
5181,Natural Ice,2.72,this beer holds a special place in my heart while its certainly not the best tasting it still has positive qualities that get it such a high rating specifically its alcohol content while were only talking about a 17 abv difference between natty ice and natty light it makes a world of difference this beer has also been found to be the most cost efficient way to get sloshed outside of drinking hard alcohol at least in my area its a college essential that i would put above textbooks
5182,Natural Ice,4.24,just a good all bargain american ice lager very smooth and delicate flavor the snobs will hate it but its a great value and delicious on a hot summer day
5183,Natural Ice,1.79,what sort of unfortunate turns of events led me to drink this i  just dont even if thats all there is available although its nickname is natty ice this was just plain nasty
5184,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.27,dont get the hate honestly enjoyed this baby for years in australia great after work delight needs to be ice cold however to mask slight chemical taste due i think to the reduction in abv
5185,Victoria Bitter (VB),4.63,my favourite aussieadjunct beer tastes like most australian beers used to taste like before the abv taxation pushed beers to lower their abv and flavour best ice cold and not a session beer at 49 but if i want a couple of thirst quenching beers after work this is my choice
5186,Victoria Bitter (VB),2.9,ondraught at gilligans cairns queensland australia 75 aud per pot  okay its not a bitter so theres a definite misnomer there but its a pleasant easy drinking brew for what it is  c  average
5187,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.48,a bit of a nostalgia beer for me drank a watering holes throughout the nt darwin etc burnt firewood taste coupled with a flat formadehyde back note refreshing but dangerous not bad for what you get
5188,Victoria Bitter (VB),1.06,the worst beer in the world i am ashamed to be a melbournian when it comes to this vile bile i remember getting drunk on this turdfoam when i was 17 back in the late 80s the beer scene in melbourne was a lot cruder back then and the variety was pretty abysmal but hey we were none the wiser i discovered coopers red back in 1990 and never looked back glad to say that now and just like everywhere else we have a wonderful variety of beers that i would have died for back then but  back to vomit bombs i had the misfortune of drinking a vermin belch the other day and i couldnt even finish it its like the recipe is  get some hops bung it in a huge vat made of aluminum wee into it stir it aroundand wait about a day hey presto the most pitiful beer every produced
5189,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.09,victoria bitter vb the virus beater the very best the vomit beer victor bravos theres almost as many analogies for victoria bitter as litres of this stuff drunk on a daily basis its arguably australias most famous beer  piss off fosters  and is certainly the most popular theres hardly a pub where you cant find it either in tap or canstubbie and the words to the jingle are more well known than the lyrics to the national anthem is it girt by sea or gird by sea  you either like vb or you dont theres no room for sitting on the fence with this beer its either something more sacred than holy water or if your mum was on fire you wouldnt even use it to try and extinguish her i used to hate vb i used to hate the bogan connotations that came with drinking this beer i used to hate people who drank it i was a downright snob and used to look down on people who drank it  especially religiously but my palate is diversifying and lets give it a go to see if i still hate it or whether its something that is at the very least tolerable  look this is going to be my 11th beer review and all but 2 so far have been aussie adjunct lagers i will get to the better beers eventually poured into a pint glass weve got a lovely honey gold liquid clean filtered a thin finger of foam has accumulated at the top but it didnt froth up its a little darker than your standard aussie adjunct lagers and it actually looks more appealing  smell the classic aussie adjunct lager smell heavy earthy grassy notes come courtesy of the pride of ringwood hops sweet pale malt slightly sour am i overreacting by saying the sourness almost smells like orange peel i remember thinking it used to smell offensive i no longer do it just smells classically australian  taste malty sweetness nice bitterness getting that grassy citrus peel flavour coming through on the bitterness smooth easy drinking flavours are mellow but prominent subtle sour tang with a dry finish that makes me want another sip slight adjunct taste but not overly powering  feel fairly highly carbonated which makes it convenient to slam down that ice cold beer ice cold it is extremely refreshing body is medium  overall either ive lowered my expectations or ive diversified my palate and im no longer a snob i cant hate this beer any more im not saying i necessarily love it but i have grown to appreciate it its a part of australian culture and its not going anywhere soon its certainly more drinkable than i remember it and whilst i probably wont go buying slabs of this stuff i certainly wont hesitate to go for it if im at the pub and theres nothing else worth drinking  will say the beer has to be drunk cold ice cold you cant afford to let these warm up once its creeping up to room temperature the bitterness from the hops seem to curdle and you get all sorts of nasty flavours going on thats where i think most people go wrong with vb its simply not served cold enough most lagers should be ice cold and ice cold is where the respectable flavours come out to play once it starts warming up grab another one or just drink em quicker
5190,Victoria Bitter (VB),2,2004 375 ml bottle in norway sweetish orangelike aroma the flavour is mostly bitterness  more than in fosters and castlemaine but not really pleasant will not be a regular beer of mine this one
5191,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.35,sure its just another commercial lager but with it comes good memories of a broke youngster partying at the local rsl hence the higher score one thing it has going for it for an average to shtty lager is that its slightly heavier in taste not a totally watered down commercial lager as many are would i recommend it probably not but if youre in oz have a few just to blend in
5192,Victoria Bitter (VB),1,disgusting
5193,Victoria Bitter (VB),4.65,this is my favorite beer after satanic chimp from monkey paw i understand why so many people hate it i just like that unfortunately i havent been able to find it in the us maybe its nostalgia for drunk port visits back in my navy days im trying to get my list together
5194,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.46,ive had it numerous times in pint glasses stubbies straight out of the can even off the ground on one drunken evening it tastes average at best regardless of what you do with it its a middleclass beer thats supposed to be pounded on a hot summer evening after a hard days work in the trenches or from your couch  the look is like any other dimeadozen lager that classic pissyellow tint the smell has hints of alcohol and rice the taste is well i dont know like a budweiser but with more tang the feel is below average very carbonated and watery
5195,OB Lager Beer,2.36,a neighbor gave me one of these beers good thing because lagers are not my style just got back from a bike ride and figured itd be a good time to try it i will sum this review up by saying if it was any worse it would be flushed by now
5196,OB Lager Beer,1.1,when there is nothing else available while in the rok you drink ob or soju think the bud for korea
5197,OB Lager Beer,4.1,loved this beer when i was stationed in korea at 10 a 16oz glass back in the early 70s it was a great deal
5198,OB Lager Beer,2.25,apours a straw color with a slight head and lacing aaroma has lemongrass hints tthe taste follows the nose with a lemongrass flavor ma light bodied well carbonated beer oa decent lager
5199,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,4.39,liked this a bit more than the galaxy version  both pale in comparison to the ddh version but this was really solid a little more dank than the other two versions but thats aok with me medium body a little heavier than what id classify as an easy drinker however these are perfect for a day at the pool or cracking on a hot muggy day good to great beer  you wont be disappointed in this one
5200,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,4.75,canned 11032020 enjoyed on 11272020
5201,Genesee Ice Beer,2.5,i bought a 24oz can for 129 because i was on a budget it doesnt have much in the sense of appearance or smell hell even the can art is bland its not bad tastewise i was kind of expecting it to be kind of appalling like many ice beers but i have to admit this is one of the better ones having said that its still way down there in comparison to the 1000 beers ive had
5202,Genesee Ice Beer,2.58,average ice beer  refreshing on a hot summer day
5203,Genesee Ice Beer,2.96,12 ounce can poured into a nonic tumbler  lmedium white head with minimal retention left decent lacing though the beer is a crystal clear medium gold color  ssweet maltiness corn is the primary aroma  ttaste follows the nosesweet maltiness and corn no real hop bitesnap more flavorful than the top selling aals like coors lightbud lightbudweiser  fa little bit syrupy well carbonated  othis one is a bargain at 1495 for a 30 pack in pa
5204,Genesee Ice Beer,1.96,giant poor alcoholics edition can 24 oz poured into a rather inappropriate dogfish head nonic glass  has a relatively clear straw blonde body with a surprisingly abiding head of 2 fingers nice lacing too  aroma of lottery tickets and wet towels urinal cakes corn general maltiness  flavor is full of flaws i mean wow i havent had an unclean beer like this in awhile corn flakes doused in bleach followed by oysters saltines and wet leaves  feel is crisp but not clean rather starchy on the palate with some actual alcohol heat for 55  overall ice beers are a joke but i was really surprised that at 55 this beer made absolutely no effort to disguise its alcohol content this is a truly horribly made beer and im being completely objective a warming furnace to your throat and stomach at a measly 55 abv
5205,Genesee Ice Beer,1.8,l pours typical golden amber color with a reasonably large head and some lacing  s corn malt cracker and slight grassy hops  t tastes way too alcoholic for the abv the only ice beer with noticable fusel alcohol tastes worse than steel reserve with slightly less burn other than that it does taste like corn and more malt than some beers doesnt taste anything like regular genesee beer the cream ale or even its high gravity cousin genesee black  f goes down smooth a little syrupy but not too much body  overall the worst ice beer even at 99 cents for a 24 ounce can there are plenty of better options including all of the other genesee products which are pretty good
5206,Genesee Ice Beer,2.76,42419 chicago 116 24 oz can including tax purchased at shop and save on 41919 no canning date noted multiple pours into a pint glass light straw clear colour pour light white head quickly disappates leaving thin white lacing sweet corn grain aroma light corn and malt taste too sweet very thin mouthfeel slight fizzy carbonation light drinking overall ok offering
5207,Genesee Ice Beer,3.02,24oz can stamped a249 poured into a bow tie glass at fridge temp 55 abv the beer pours bright pale straw yellow with abundant bone white head the head recedes to a thin cap and leaves plenty of lacing the aroma is faint with some corny sweetness and maybe sulfur the taste is barely sweet with a little tang minimal grain presence and no bitterness the mouthfeel is thin bodied adequately carbonated and semi dry in the finish there is a little slick feel after the swallow but no aftertaste overall ok this is an extremely cheap and nonoffensive way to deliver alcohol to folks who happen to hate bitterness or grain presence in a beer i would advise to drink this one ice cold it does get better as it warms
5208,Genesee Ice Beer,3.5,a very pleasant surprise i rate genesee ice highly not so much for being an exceptional beer in itself but for its pricevalue ratio at 55 abv and as low as 8 for a 15 pack here in ri its body flavour and strength beat out all other popular cheap beers many of which cost significantly more its little brother genesee light falls and tastes flat however and unlike the other lowend beer brands genesee ice doesnt wreak the same havoc in your stomach if youre drinking a lot which you probably will be with it due to an ongoing sale its been my cheap beer of choice for months but even if similarly priced with bud rolling rock or narragansett my prior gotos i would argue its better in about every way
5209,Genesee Ice Beer,3.55,24 ounce can into lager glass canned on 12212017 pours crystal clear golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers light spotty lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation good appearance aromas of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit light honeypepper and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness nice and pleasant aromas with pale maltcorn and mild earthy hop notes with solid strength taste of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit light honeypepper and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness mild herbal floral grassy peppery bitterness on the finish lingering notes of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit light honeypepper and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit nice robustness of pale maltcorn and mild earthy hop flavors with a solid maltbitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish a bit of fruity corn aromasflavors but not overwhelming fairly crispclean finishing nicely clean on lager flavors not too fruityyeasty lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness medium carbonation and body with a very smooth moderately breadygrainy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice minimal warming alcohol for 55 overall this is good iced pale adjunct lager all around good robustness of pale maltcorn and mild earthy hop flavors very smooth and fairly crispcleanrefreshing to drink nicely clean and rich pils maltgrains and mild earthy hop presencebalance not too overdone on adjuncts and not overly sweet a nicely enjoyable offering and well made style example
5210,Genesee Ice Beer,3.06,24 oz can f258 purchased cold with several other malt liquor in a frenzy split between a shaker pint and tulip glass  l crystalclear medium amber colored good bit of white foam builds on pour but immediately breaks down actually some thin streaks of belgian lace  s generic adjunct lager aromas on the malty liquor side slightly toasty dry straw grain aroma hints of spiced apple maybe white grape slight whiff of alcohol bland sort of manila folder note as well altogether uninspiring dull  t rather dry eversoslightly caramelkissed cereallike malt base strange notes of corn kernel and wet oxidized interior of lemon rind in finishaftertaste light leafy bitterness begging to be intensified the malt opens up a little but its overall essence is of toasted corn syrup  a spicy ester away from being a mediocre maibock at best  f slight touch of sizzle on the edges of whats essentially a marginally watereddown wort lightmedium bodied delicate oily plushness  o industrial brewing being industrial not sure why one would bother with a weaker version of a malt liquor  maybe its a bit more daring of a drink than a light beer a beer seemingly caught between the better of two directions buries natty ice but i couldnt see getting this again
5211,Old German,2.61,random gas station pickup in pendleton classic can art caught my eye i literally have never seen this in my life a surprising find in the west especially a not super beery town had to snag it its not real good and i was glad to be sharing the can an exceedingly cheap and cheap tasting brew super thin and yellow thinnest beer ive had in a long time really watered down feeling i perceive that before any real aroma or flavor its minimal as they come there are huge bubbles in this and it puts out a big head but it falls fast some metallic character after a sip it builds a little into a not awful mineral profile no hops here at all and the yeast is obviously a lager strain but boy its light and cheap to me in this the grain is so pale so watered down and mild boring and also so subtle its almost flavorless but it opens as it warms unfavorably into an adjuncty budget large format norm par for the course maybe slightly better than some of its peers but really very little here like beer flavored water but i dont hate the lightness or the high carbonation they kind of save this add in just a bit of refreshment value i like the packaging best of all and will not be in a hurry to buy this again
5212,Old German,3.17,when you want a beer but youve been working in the yard or youre outdoors fishing camping enjoying yourself youre not going to want a high gravity terminal imperial double hazy founders edition beer youre going to want something that hits the spot and goes down smooth beers in this category are not expensive and not high abv which is good because its going to be gone before you realize that you probably should have grabbed a water too  pours cleanly into a glass with a nice though short lived head faint grain aroma a nice light fizz on the tongue and a smooth light flavor and clean finish  dont look to this beer to impress you look to this beer to be a nice beer at the dollar per 16 oz price point similar to pbr and olympia this beer reminds me of oly before they were sold
5213,Old German,4.76,this reminds me of olympia but creamier taters gonna tate theres way worse beer than this good price for 6 pounders under 6 bucks
5214,Old German,3.61,16oz can stamped 0252 0211 poured into a tall pilsner glass at fridge temp no abv listed on label the beer pours bright light golden yellow with off white head the head recedes to a thin uneven cap and leaves a little lacing the aroma is pilsner malt and slight yeast maybe a hint of orchard fruit the taste is semisweet pale malt with a noticeable sour corn finish maybe a hint of oxidation as well minimal bitterness the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish cleanly lagered overall ok this can is presumably 8 months old at this point so it was bound to not be its best i would definitely try again as all the makings of a solid aal are there
5215,Old German,4,old german has a thick soapy head and a clear bubbly straw appearance with some fine white sediment throughout the aroma is of funky wet grain the flavor is of slightlysweet cereal grain with practically no hop bitterness old german has a medium body and a crisp finish  rjt
5216,Old German,2.87,picked this up from the cheap foods rainbow foods outlet big 24 oz can i think  pours looking like your standard adjunct lager straw yellow fizzy white head 25 aroma was corn and lager yeast little bit of those hydraulic fluid feels that adjunct lagers can get  taste you can tell after the massive carbonation push is mostly corn grain and bittering hops to a lesser degree its light bodied enough i dig the german guy on the logo though im sure there is somehow some purple hair gape mouth selfie taker who finds it problematic kind of makes me think of this as more of a session like country club malt liquor its not ever going to be a go to beer but sure man 100 degree weather id crush one of these again in between other beers as a palate cleanser if you will  i dont think there is anything offensive here its largely one of those beers that tastes like a carbonated water boilermaker shot was dropped into a normal bmc like beer
5217,Old German,4.84,its beer taste like a beer should taste if you like beer you will like old german if you do not you will not like old german prost
5218,Old German,1.82,ok right out of the starting gate you know this isnt going to be a beer of any real quality it runs about 12 bucks for a 30 pack so you know youre buying a beer to quench your thirst and probably nothing more pours a very light yellow with a fizzy short lasting head no aroma and a very weak body honestly if i had tasted this blindfolded i might have pegged it as a weak tasting cream soda the phrase used as their slogan the world knows no finer is no small exaggeration to be sure but if you are looking for an inexpensive ok cheap beer to have at a cook out or something similar this beer would do the trick but barely
5219,Old German,3.06,i found this beer at my local distributor 15 pack for 999 the marketing is nothing special its a silly german caricature with a red banner  lets be real this is not gourmet beer its a cheap really cheap lager you get when you want a buzz without spending more than your spare change for that class of beer old german is actually great i wasnt expecting much for taste but it has a decent carbonated hoppy flavor that beats anything coors or miller lite personally i love carbonated beer so i may have a positive bias for the taste i will say though this beer needs to be ice cold to enjoy its not a bavarian import that tastes good warm no sir put it in the cooler  the best aspect of this beer is that it isnt a headache in a can like natural ice or other dirt cheap beers out there what im saying is that it wont punish you the next day so long as you dont go overboard overall a cheap decent tasting light beer to go along with throwing football with the pals or washing your motorcycle id rather have carlsberg elephant but i cant always justify 11 dollars for a six pack
5220,Old German,2.95,i had never seen or heard of this before but as soon as i saw a cheap fifteen pack i was hooked the ridiculous caricature of a bavarian is probably too stupid to be culturaly insensitive but its close stupidly light color and perfect clarity this looks like store brand apple juice nose doesnt seem to exist  a little bit of malt sweetness and a respectable bread note otherwise kind of watery and blah overcarbonated in the finish but for the style it is inoffensive and drinkable if generic and mediocre
5221,Old German,2.54,i saw this in my friends fridge the other evening and just had to try one never saw an old german beer before um very light colored but hey it looks like beer smellbeery in a slight way taste carbonated water with some slight malts its really hard to pull a flavor out of this stuff feelit had some suds to it if you dont want the underpowered flavor of some other junk adjunct light beer then give this one a try
5222,The Broken Truck,4.47,pours golden with frothy soap off white head mustyness and wash rind cheese with a touch of apple flesh on the nose the first thing that stands out is that this is soft  it doesnt have any commandeering characteristics that detract from the others i get some apple some arugula bitterness with restrained acidity maybe some musty sour cherry too kinda like what you get in a kriek but very much more subtle this is an excellent excellent spon beer one of the best beers of this variety ive had in some time
5223,The Broken Truck,4.63,man if i had to put potentially the best beers of 2022 against each other it might be this and that gueuze from new glarus whooo boy some gooduns this is the 22 bottle  pours yellow out on the river summer winding down lets finish it up hits some amazing funky sour spontaneous notes and they said it couldnt be done on this side of the pond just a delight to smell the best of what tilamook has to offer boasts fresh french oak feels bugs grapefruit lemon rind bleu cheese green apple yogurt the gangs all here  the taste was such a nice thing great bottle on one of those awesome yet sad close to summer beers made it memorable its vibrant fresh cut hay and oak alongside some citrus wedges like you just stomped some kids at youth soccer one of the best expressions of brett ever in a beer sawft body too never felt too acidic or sour this is honestly better than most belgian gueuzes i realize given the demographics of beer nerds theyre going to keep fetishizing western europe but ill be more than happy to take any of these wisconsin and oregon gems off your hands
5224,The Broken Truck,4.29,opened up no 6 120 7 121 and 8 122 together and tasted sidebyside  all three boasted a beautiful golden yellow on the pour with frothy aromatic head that was slow to settle into the body of the beer  no6 brought notes of lemon zest oak and white grape must on a sweet musty backbone no 7 came on sweeter with more of a citrus candy quality and a bit less brett character the oak component had more of a freshly cut aroma to it and preceded notes of bleu cheese that i didnt get on no6 no8 was probably the most distinctly unique white wine like with 7 but more of a grapefruitspecific citrus quality and a deeper complexity of wet hay and an overall better balance of sweet  funky  the palate on all three of these were led predominantly with drying tannin and bitter citrus peel the oakiness was relatively similar amongst the three and bolstered the flavor influence from the yeast bill however while no8 showed its youth with the least amount of bitterness 7  8 had comparable dryness and a more noticeable citrusy bitterness no 6 was also had the highest level of residual puckering tartness  lightbodied dry and lightly bitter mouthfeel to all three as mentioned varying levels of tartness  acid but all very soft in their carbonation and smooth in the finish  overall im honestly surprised with how similar each vintage of these beers was each had their own unique nuances but when broken down you could find very similar characteristics on both the nose and the palate with both characterizing a predominance of fresh oak brett bitter citrus drying tannin and a noticeable albeit subtle funkycheesy quality on the backbone definitely fun to have these all sidebyside
5225,The Broken Truck,4.5,og batch 1 broken truck classic de garde taste similar in quality to all of the bu beers that were bottled during the brewerys infancy it lacks the nuance of trevors newer offerings minimal funk lesser barrel treatment aggressively sour overall a legendary beer whose story was greater than its contents
5226,The Broken Truck,4.56,appearance  the beer from a double sealed bottle poured a golden color with an aggressively bubbled white head  smell  the brett character came out in the nose with a degree of bitterness  taste  grass green apples and a brett character that really stands out the finish had a bitter earthy quality it was not particularly sour but it definitely brought the funk  mouthfeel  the carbonation was aggressive quickly sweeping away any sweetness  overall  no fruits or adjuncts are needed this was great
5227,The Broken Truck,4.9,103 good stuff
5228,Miles To Go Before I Sleep,4.65,poured into a 13 oz teku glass says canned spring of 2023 pours midnight black with 2 plus finger sticky mocha head that leaves a thin wall of lace with excellent retention 475  aroma is peanut butter cup cocoa coffee milk oreo caramel and toffee 475  taste follows peanut butter and chocolate dominates with some roasted coffee caramel toffee and vanilla bean 475  mouthfeel is above average not sticky or dry soft gentle carbonation and 91 abv it goes down extremely easy 425  overall this is a very tasty stout i still wish it had a little bigger body but still really impressive 45
5229,Natty Daddy (6%),1.19,when you want a beer really bad abinbev has a really bad beer for you no foamy head no lacing has one strong distinct flavor note which is fusel alcohol which meets gasoline unrefined and crude as a american basically malt liquor gets a hit on a hot summer day at the trailer park ill drink water when i am desperate before i will drink this crap has the worst aftertaste this side of lithuania and the worst headache and hangover ever if its the end of the month youre on a cheapie budget buy decent malt liquor instead olde english 800 colt 45 or mickeys is 1000 times better and somewhat drinkable and as cheap be forewarned if i could give this negative point ratings i would
5230,Natty Daddy (6%),1.37,i had never seen it before but i had to try it a mistake that i will not make again if i was just wanting to get loaded there are better and quicker ways
5231,Natty Daddy (6%),2.38,people miss the point of a beer like natty daddy it is one of my favorite beers because not only is it the cheapest beer on the market but it tastes better than the majority of adjunct lagers out there and has a very generous abv of 6 it costs 977 for a case at my local store that makes it extremely shareable as well you cant beat the priceabvtaste combination would i want to drink this beer every day no is this beer comparable to beers that were crafted for taste no this beer was crafted for affordability it doesnt even taste bad theres alot worse tasting lagers out there with half the abv and almost double the price ill buy a case of natty daddy any day thumbs up to anheuserbusch because this is the only adjunct lager i buy to this day
5232,Natty Daddy (6%),1.02,quite disgusting tastes like carbonated water with a slight beer taste its hard for me to comment on any aromas and flavors because i could taste nothing but a very generic watered down beer flavor theres really nothing here
5233,Natty Daddy (6%),2.72,poured from a 12 oz can has a very pale yellow color with a 1 inch head smell is of corn mild grains green apples taste is grains malts some corn is present hints of green apple mild and easy drinking feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall nothing special not bad for a cheap lager but nothing to get excited about
5234,Nut Brown Ale,4.47,149 oz can  pours mostly clear dark red amber brown with a creamy offwhite light khaki colored foam head smells real nutty like almonds walnuts chestnut toffee toasted bread caramel a hint of chocolate dried fruits apricot with herbal earthy hops tastes like nutty caramel almond walnut chestnuts lightly toasted brown bread a hint of chocolate toffee subtle raisin dried fruits apple apricot some tobacco woody cedar pine resin and herbal earthy hops feels lighter medium bodied creamy smooth with moderate low carbonation overall a really nice english brown ale
5235,Nut Brown Ale,4.4,brown in color as expected head was more white than tan which was not expected nose is very malty taste was sweet malty and nutty very well done
5236,Nut Brown Ale,3.5,bit of a metallic flavour
5237,HopDevil,4.38,poured a semilucid copper color from a 12 oz bottle best by feb 15 23 into a standard pint glass with a creamy barley colored finger high head that clings to the glass as it recedes aroma is mainly malty with overtones of cereal grain and grapefruit taste is bitter throughout but very well balanced with the malty sweetness and spicy alcohol flavor on the follow through the bitterness lingers with creamy thickness in the mouth for this medium to full bodied brew there is even a nice carbonation tingle on the tongue its been so long since ive had one of these that i had forgotten how good they are this is an iconic ale that lives up to the hype
5238,HopDevil,4.05,pours out an amber color with a nice thick head the taste is somewhat fruity and truly different some notes of fruit like blackberry or blueberry with a hoppy finish all in all a great tasting beer
5239,HopDevil,3.73,maybe im drinking from a mis tapped keg but this was too malty and dark for me wanted a hop bomb got a malt grenade
5240,HopDevil,4.1,tasty traditional ipa from victory this might be my favorite from the brewer great balance of hop bite and malt backbone would look for this fresh again
5241,HopDevil,4.15,this beer pours a clear dark bronze color with significant effervescence and a moderate head that dissipated quite slowly  as expected there is a strong fresh hoppy aroma the taste is very pleasant dry and hoppy with caramel undertones the mouth feel is a bit syrupy but still refreshing
5242,HopDevil,3.78,good beer but not my fave
5243,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,1.45,my bottle was heavily infected 2022 anyone else have this happen
5244,Parabajava,4.69,2022 vintage drank 083123 pours a jet black with little carbonation strong aroma of morning coffee with chocolate syrup palate is choc covered espresso beans soaked in bourbon barrels great mouthfeel with a gentle sweetness thats not overpowering and very smooth given the abv absolutely perfect and easily the best ba coffee stout ive had
5245,Parabajava,4.51,received as a gift from a kind friend  poured from a crowler filled on 73123  enjoyed on 82023 into a snifter  clear seal brown liquid rests beneath a beige crust receding to a thin ring and surface slick gentle lacing slick thin sheen of tears  chocolate fine tobacco molasses black licorice cherry pits black coffee and brown sugar in the nose  stupendous  boozy oaky toasty lightly charred with perhaps even more flavor following the nose in the finish than on the palate wave after wave of malt and barrel complexity bittersweet and almost but never quite smokeyspicy mild bitterness throughout earthywoodsy mediumdry finish with hints of black tea and bourbon  slippery almost oily mouthfeel with some residual tannins  forgot how good the base beer can be and the coffee adds another layer of roastfruitbitterness without distracting from the character of the stout wonderful example of the style
5246,Parabajava,4.45,12 ounce bottle into a snifter 2022 edition had 41323  pours a mostly opaque dark brown with a half inch foamy head and some foamy lacing aromas of coffee bourbon roasted malt chocolate oak some char and cocoa a hint of cherry flavors of intense coffee roasted malt bourbon chocolate oak smooth a solid full body appropriately carbonated  the coffee is prominent bold and outstanding the barrels show well the base is solid the feel is great will buy this anytime it is available
5247,Parabajava,4.49,2022 vintage  when i first tride og parabola i quite enjoyed it but honestly had higher expectations and i think coffee would improve upon the base beer so im hopeful for this one lets crack open this legendary variant of a legendary beer and see what its all about  pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of frothy tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  its definitely punchy in the nose somewhere between roasty and bitter white still presenting a nice sweetness im picking up on aromas of cacao nib earthy hops roasted espresso molasses burnt toast toasted oak vanilla light brown sugar and tobacco  it trends much more bitter in taste but that underlying sweetness helps things from getting out of hand on the front end of the sip im tasting molasses earthy hops cacao nib dark roast coffee plum rye toast burnt caramel light vanilla and brown sugar the swallow brings notes of cacao nib dark roast coffee burnt toast toasted oak black cherry caramel earthy hops light plum and molasses  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth beer finishes dry and roasty  yeah this is definitely better than the original the coffee is just the kick it needs maybe ill get to try some other variants some day
5248,Parabajava,4.37,look  love the thick blackness with a nice thick tan head great rimming and lacing smell roasted malt and coffee barrel slight dark fruit taste roasted malt coffee dark chocolate barrel slightly bitter feel creamy full body light carb overall  pretty great
5249,Parabajava,4.13,aroma is boozy bourbon with a bit of classic chocolaty stout  jammy molasses and plum body is strong with bourbon followed shortly by roasty coffee and the two combine to make something like a mounds bar with a swig of strong black coffee one of the best examples of a good barrel aged stout out there
5250,Parabajava,5,042723 bottle  home
5251,Parabajava,4.52,pitch black pour with a full brown head the nose is great espresso added to usual parabola but the barrel not cut at all taste is coffee and chocolate forward barrel is rustic roasted malt parabola base is still great body is a touch thinner but still earthy rustic and boozy with roast this is well done but i like the original best still
5252,Parabajava,4.25,2022 version poured cellar temp to a mug base parabola has always been excellent this coffee version is good with a new profile to the base gone is the bright complex woody bourbon up front that has been replaced with a milder more chocolate front the middle is parabola in body and flavor the coffee comes into play as a mouthfeel factor and an endsip lingering dirty cup of joe its a decent coffee flavor its slightly odd to me that it comes into focus so late in the flavor no alcohol burn and really not much warming as one might expect from this big abv bomb for my money id stick with base parabola or the anniversary offerings
5253,Parabajava,4.58,i has this once years ago 2016 or 2017 in a 22oz bomber split with a friend but havent had it since glad to finally revisit this is a 2022 vintage poured from a 12oz bottle into a tg md snifter pours light brown but gathers in the glass a shiny dark brown to almost black with a thin mocha brown foam cap that settles into a thin collar around the rim of the glass bourbon barrel and coffee on the nose for a beautiful mix of aromas plus some chocolate from the base stout and oak taste follows and to me is even better than the nose the coffee is present but theres still tons of barrel and i get a lot of good rich chocolate notes from the base beer mediumfull mouthfeel bordering on full but its just a touch too carbonated for me its still very sticky and mouthcoating and one could argue the carbonation makes it a little easier drinking incredible barrelaged imperial coffee stout
5254,Parabajava,4.59,poured at fridge temp pours jet black with a thin half inch layer of light brown head tiny bubbles rising throughout the glass the nose is fantastic intense coffee but a really nice coffee smell not cheap stale coffee grounds this is a fresh coffee smell i roast my own beans and this is like dipping my nose in the beans a few hours after roasting lovely other smells of chocolate vanilla toffee malts burnt wood and some brown sugar  the taste is absolutely insane one of the best tastes from a coffee stout again the coffee is front and center a lovely fresh coffee taste not overly bitter at all dark chocolate vanilla marmalade brown sugar a touch of maple walnuts and salted caramel the barrel comes through here for sure but definitely complimentary rather than dominant  the mouthfeel is thick and robust the alcohol is there on the swallow but definitely doesnt drink like its 138 abv overall one of the best coffee stouts i have ever had
5255,Parabajava,4.79,l dark jet black poured on draft into a 3oz sampler not a ounce of light can be seen aside from looking at the very top looks not to heavy not to thin somewhere in the middle s heavy toasty coffee notes on the inside dark chocolate followed by it cant smell the bourbon at all in this one t dark rich malts on the sweeter side big coffee here mixed in with chocolate not getting much cherry in this one as its very covered by the malty coffee chocolatiness getting some molasses the dark cherry comes more in the after taste the more i sip and let it sit f medium to heavy bodied tastes are on the thicker side  oily o this actually was an amazing beer probably the best ive tried by firestone walker by far
5256,Parabajava,4.75,just scored a little stash of the 2022 release cap released without a hiss despite a few days being jostled in the fedex truck and handoffs pour issued a slight capper which receded into a persistent gurgly ring at the fill line nose is of coffee right at the forefront some nuances that might have me recalling oatmeal stouts or caramel corn no noticeable barrel burn taste is coffeebitter sweet tangy a titch of grapefruity hoppiness should i gargle it swallow is of strong bitter coffee caramel sweetness some ticklish carbonation slight barrel presence  a very fine sample ill be dispensing the remaining vessels most judiciously
5257,Curiosity Thirty Two,4.33,canned on 7523 consumed on 81223  pours an opaque sunflowerorange hue capped with two fingers of creamy eggshellwhite foam great head retention leaves a finger of frothy cap and dense collar while a generous spattering of spotty lacing coats the walls of the glass  aromas of ripe mango are accented with guava zest and pineapple husk with orange oils informing a peppery dank as a creamy floral build settles through the bouquet  taste brings mango bubblegum into notes of orange and mango as white pepper stimulates an earthier aspect of peach zest over the midpalate and orange tang invigorates the close  mouthfeel shows a medium body and a moderate spritz of carbonation levying a subdued bog to a drying prickle past the midpalate toward a back end both subliminally resinous and coyly juicy  an initially tropical amalgam explores myriad hop subtext in a turn toward swampy earthy rinds before reinvigorating a brighter cleaner base a sampling of the tree house ipa profile at its most comprehensive form
5258,Curiosity Thirty Two,4.63,from a 16oz can dated 7523 into a 20oz pint glass can message welcome back old friend  pours a thick opaque pale yellowish orange with about one finger of white head several minutes in and half of the head is still present tons of lacing  decently strong aromas of orange grape tangerine and a touch of lemon zest  taste follows has a sweet white wine vibe going on citrus and hint of lemon nice earthy bitterness on the back of the sip  fullbodied thick soft mouthfeel slight dry stickiness on the swallow lingering bitter aftertaste low to medium carbonation  man this is a fabulous brew loving every sip

5266,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,3.99,b11 2020 appearance is a bright translucent yellow with plenty of persistent white head aroma while somewhat muted is really nice up close blind i might actually think this was a hefeweizen given the clove like esters im getting  taste is more in line with what i was expecting with lemon  hay and some mixed fruit very light and tasty and extraordinarily easy drinking absolutely perfect way to end a beautiful long weekend
5267,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.3,appearance faintly cloudy strawyellow with a slight cap of bubbles on the top that quickly subsided  smell moderate barnyard funk grassyhay notes and mild fruity notes  taste following the hints from the nose i pick up moderate funk notes moderate grassyhay notes and mild citrus fruit notes the individual flavors are very distinct from each other but at the same time form a cohesive flavor profile the beer finishes dry with some mildly bitter grassyhay notes  mouthfeel lightbodied with a modest level of carbonation  overall a very nice saison tasty flavor profile with a light body and dry finish
5268,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.31,cloudy golden body with a white cap that settles into a collar grapefruit lemon bright oak faint melon and passion fruit faint yeast nose taste is simpler with big lemon and oak mild saison yeast faint ripe tropical fruits feel is light and cool sour and slightly acidic dries a bit with yeast on finish
5269,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.23,bottle poured a blonde color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and light lacing aroma of tart notes with some funky brett notes and light vinous notes taste is a mix of tart notes with some funky brett notes and a vinous finish with light oak body is about average for style with good carbonation and no perceptible alcohol enjoyable saison with a nice level of complexity
5270,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.51,pours soft hazy yellowstraw with a massive head and great retention nose is primarily brett lemon oak but smells fantastic taste is similar to the nose a light tartness from the lemon and hay funk from the brett and balance from the oak the flavors all blend together wonderfully to form a fantastic saison the mouthfeel is soft and pillowy each taste of the slight tartness invites additional sipping just a wonderful farmhouse ale
5271,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.32,poured from a 750ml bottle into my troubadour tulip  lightly hazy icterine liquid supports a half finger of magnolia soft peaks crenelated nearly rocky lacing superior retention  lemon curd wildflowers hay and short bread in the nose  mild wild notes and hints of white grapes as well  brett forward on the palate tart funky and gently peppery unripe pears meyer lemon and some minerality low bitterness moderate sourness more fruit than phenols finishes fairly dry with some residual wild elements flavor improves a bit as it warms with some faint peach emerging  medium bodied soft well carbonated refreshing yet satisfying  well crafted controlled rather than rustic better with food as the ales flavors seem more refined and diverse in contrast to whatever breadcheese you might pair them with
5272,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.65,on tap at windsor homebrew in anaheim ca  tally ho i feel like errol flynn in the seahawk while drinking this thing just wow its as if nothing can stop me and that i could have it all maybe my mind is even a bit blurred and stirred by its beauty so much so that i think that i dont need olivia de haviland because i want them all  i am lost i am found i am i just am

5274,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.46,appearance  the beer poured an orangegold color with a bubbly white head  smell  the nose had pleasant citrus notes with the saison funk also apparent  taste  my initial impression was the taste of green apples the sour impression fit the green apple notes the saison aspects produced a vinegary funk any sweetness from the beginning was cancelled by the dry finish  mouthfeel  the carbonation gave influence to the dry finish  overall  this is pretty much everything i want in a saison i dont need heartburn medicine to drink this beauty
5275,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.35,love it
5276,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.56,this isnt so much a review as synchronicity i had a choice at the local liquor store between this and north coast old rasputin as i sipped this i said to myself just prior to rating this tastes a lot like old rasputin and when i rated it i came up with 456 exactly what i rated old rasputin this is a good thing because i like a thicker richer stout and this qualifies the aroma right out the can is knockout and after the first couple sips i doubt i could tell it from or
5277,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.14,its toasty and malty its chocolatey its got coffee theres licorice and a hint of spicy hops overall there is a lot going on and a good balance of flavors
5278,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.14,l motor oil uneven toffee brown head s light and sweet caramel nuts notes of leather and vanilla and cookie dough some bourbon too t more bitter than the nose very roasty upfront with leather and a bit of char then caramel and a bit of hoppiness finishing with coffee and dark chocolate notes of vanilla and cookie dough throughout f medium bodied silky smooth alcohol is fairly masked o definitely more of a ris than an oatmeal not that im disappointed at all would love to try the ba version
5279,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,3.44,looks like soupy molasses with a short brown head that quickly dissipates syrup film lace on the glass smell and taste chocolate and coffee pungent sour notes that i dont care for feel well im guessin with 94 abv ill be feelin pretty good by the time i finish it overall not my cup of tea im hopin on
5280,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.4,visually beautiful it pours out silky and thick  very impressive sweet and inviting in the nose this ris was one of the better ones ive had taste is slightly muted but still good the alcohol is barely noticeableuntil it hits then you cant escape it this was really a very good ris one to keep in mind for the cookies months ahead
5281,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.64,traded a dark lord for one of these in like 2010 maybe 2009 or 2011 but definitely a long time ago this fucker has been aging  pour is inky black but still very nicely fizzy wisp of a brown head really incredible pour considering the strength and age  aroma is likewise surprisingly bright and nice i remember someone in some vague context telling me i had been hosed in the trade i dunno back then i was lousy with fff rarities this wears its age nicely and theres no hint that it wouldnt have been goodtogreat if consumed several years earlier very dark chocolate and coffee some pleasantly sharp grain the nodes that are discernably aged mellow it out but dont overwhelm it with the sort of overripe fruit nodes that often denote staleness  flavor is again surprisingly great it tastes like a more or less fresh double stout only wonderfully smoothed over aggressive but never overwhelming dark dark dark and bitter chocolate up front bittersour grain in the middle and a wee bitty kiss o the hops on the finish  maybe im just an aging man with atavistic pretensions maybe beers were just better before the market got oversaturated i dunno what i do know is i liked this quite a bit
5282,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,3.86,can poured into a mountain rambler brewery pint glass  a pours hazy golden amber with a frothy cream white head that settles to a light layer and laces nicely  s almost candied citrus and melon tropical and stone fruit earthy spicy herbal notes a touch of pine biscuity malt and a little caramel honey sweetness  t interesting mix of citrus tropical and stone fruit lemon peel melon papaya lime apricot a hint of pineapple and faint tangerine spicy herbal notes fairly earthy a touch of cedar pine biscuity malt and a little caramel honey sweetness  m just a touch on the fuller side of medium body slightly prickly moderate carbonation yet it still sits like a silk pillow on the palate  o im not sure if ive been spoiled by really good neipas out here in ca or if im just not the biggest fan of trilliums style or both this is not the first time that ive had one of their highly rated beers only to be kinda disappointed the malt base is beautifully smooth but the hops come through kinda muddied because of that spicy earthy herbal presence which given that its prominently mentioned in the description is definitely intentional i can kinda see how some people would be into this more than i am but i think there are far better ways to add depth of flavor and let the marquis hop shine
5283,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,4.5,pours a hazy yellow orange color with a short and medium bodied off white colored head that laces the glass a bit as it fades smells of melon mainly a bit of citrus and malt at the end of it tastes has a melon sweetness up front that fades to a more bitter hop finish at the end with some citrus in there as well feels lighter than it looks velvety feeling and a nice amount of carbonation overall excellent

5287,Schaefer Light,3.25,jeez the snobbery i love a gourmet 20 burger with hand cut organic potatoes fried in duck fat but of course there is a time and place for a quickgreasycheap fast food combo not gonna review a dollar menu cheeseburger it from my imaginary throne in the sky opining about my disappointment in the lack of organic butter lettuce and raw cheddar  reviewing a beer like this from the same vantage as a boutique microbrew is absolutely silly and pretentious this is a blue collar beer that isnt pretending to be otherwise  you want a cheap light session beer that serves the same purpose as an ice cold sprite look no further when frigid its super refreshing and easy to drink thats the point nice medium carbonation no aftertaste no funk no dimension just how i like it when im moving the mower from the front to back yard or changing the way overdue oil on my wifes car
5288,Schaefer Light,3.62,the one beer to have when youre having more than one
5289,Schaefer Light,5,oneof the bet light beers i have hadlike it
5290,Schaefer Light,4.42,it goes down like water a crisp no aftertaste beer its not the best but it was the first beer i ever drank age 11 lol nostalgia its the beer my dad drank until it was rolled out and no longer available at your everyday corner store man do i miss this beer
5291,Schaefer Light,2,apours a golden color with a slight head and lacing aaroma has lemongrass hints tthe taste follows the nose with a lemongrass flavor ma light bodied well carbonated beer oa decent beer
5292,Schaefer Light,3.28,its silly to attempt a philosophical description or review about this beer or any other in its class if you are buying it there is a reason and that reason is you are looking for a good value beer schaefer light is an excellent value beer  do you really care what it looks like when its poured why would you even be pouring this beer drink it straight from the can on a hot summer day  like most every other macro or american adjunct the aroma is grain sweet some corn  the taste is where schaefer light shines above its brethren it leaves absolutely no aftertaste at all finishing clean and crisp extremely clean absolutely refreshing medium carbonation great mouthfeel and completely enjoyable  i know its cliche or chic to say how much of this you consumed in college when your tastes were unrefined or that its the worst beer in existence but schaefer light is actually a great tasting refreshing value beer perfect for a 90 degree day or when you want to put many back and dont feel like crushing a huge ipa with an abv over 8 very enjoyable

5294,Beyond Good And Evil,4.81,amazing stout  not too sweet
5295,Beyond Good And Evil,5,a perfect ba maple stout had on site at hf was a 2018 vintage perfect
5296,Beyond Good And Evil,4.5,2018 vintage on tap tan head black color dark brown  smooth silky light roast light heat awesome bourbon and fudge notes the maple adds a nice light sweetness that goes well with the heat and roast from the barrels toasted marshmallow chocolate full bodied great feel very surprised with how much i liked this as i havent enjoyed hill stouts in the past
5297,Beyond Good And Evil,4.56,l  jet black in the glass with a surprisingly robust two finger head produced with aerated pour hard to believe this has been bottle conditioning for a year and a half s  waves of rich milk chocolate wet bourbon barrel prune fig chocolate covered cherries vanilla maple and light smoke smells like a pastry stout without being a pastry stout t  incredible how much of a difference 18 months of barrel aging makes over the usual 1012 the bourbon barrel presence is heavy here  both in the notes of oak from the barrel itself but also the boozy bourbon heat very rich mapley base stout that has both an espressodark chocolate character and a sweet fudginess the bourbon is just a hair on the hot side f  big mouthfeel medium carb lasting sweet finish oily and slick less velvety than expected o  one of the best barrel aged stouts ive had patience is the name of game when it comes to barrel aging and hill farmstead has it in spades very pricey 2517 oz but its worth it  91100
5298,Molson Canadian Ice,2,pretty not good
5299,Molson Canadian Ice,1,terrible
5300,Molson Canadian Ice,2.41,finale from the mixed pack never knew they made an ice version of this had the original plenty of times though i havent seen it in quite some timebut maybe thats because i havent looked for it considering high life is always my go to cheapy the word  ice  i almost always another way to say  hangover imminent  lets do it  looks the part clear yellow big white eggshell head with a shit load of carbonation nothing left after a finished glass  chemical comes to mind on the nose with fair hints of alcohol adjuncts are all there as expected creamed corn dominant  taste luckily loses the chemical factor thank satan thought this was about to be another labatt maximum ice disaster  the worst disaster since 911  adjuncts amp up hillybilly asshole level corniness  feel is rather sticky sweet and corny with a super level of carbonation swallows with a shallow alcoholic bite and leave your mouth dry as a transexuals vagina  overall its pretty average the scent is a throw off the feel is a bit odd but otherwise its just your standard run of the mill brew probably not worth the imminent hangover
5301,Molson Canadian Ice,2.25,because it was on a sale rack next to the cash register  standard version of an ice beer good lord there must be a real demand for this stuff because everybody and his brother seem to be making multiple versions its lightly colored lightly hoped and lightly flavored with a higher abv being its primary asset maybe the target customers really dont mind a lack of malt into their purchase decisions and thats ok too like roaches and spiders cheap beer has its place in the overall scheme of things  just the thing for the ice beer ticker who rarely travels north
5302,Molson Canadian Ice,2.5,pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing aroma has slight malt hints the taste follows the nose with a slight nalt flavor a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a decent beer
5303,Molson Canadian Ice,1.92,one of the worst beers ive had
5304,Scaled Way Up,4.56,no age on this one filled in a growler on 31220 i believe its 34 weeks since brewing  pours a nearly completely opaque golden yellow straw with a finger of creamy head that dissipated rather quickly big nose of mango dried peach candied ruby grapefruit cara cara orange slight bubblegum pineapple overripened apricot and portuguese sweet bread just bursting with a sweet candied tropical fruit aroma love it tons of flavor on first sip all the notes of the nose melded together well with an addition of overripe papaya slight dankness honeydew melon and a little bit of pine resin im so glad i got a 64oz growler of this one so good wonderful soft slightly resiny medium body but i kinda wish it had just a tiny bit more fullness medium bitterness medium drying medium prickly carbonation today was my first time on jury duty and im glad i stopped by trillium for this one i cant think of a better brew to relax with after a long day
5305,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.6,2022 version  pours out a very dark brown on a straight pour very little foam is agitated out  nose is oak roasted malt and a peppery quality almost like rye spice if i didnt know any better id say that this was a rye barrel aged stout or perhaps even a rye based stout  on the taste however there is more of a story oak and bourbon come through first on the palate behind that is the roasted malt bringing a dark bread note and a beautiful dark chocolate the sings throughout i picture an overdone rugelach with a dark chocolate filling in my minds eye with this brew the only sweetness being from what little is in the dough and the mildly sweetened chocolate while the oak shows up quickly it dims down as the palate progresses and the more subtle flavors appear like a tide retreating to show the rocks that sit beneath  mouthfeel is fullbodied but not oily or cloying it has heft but not the residue that often accompanies there is drying for sure most likely due to abv and barrel tannins the carbonation is considerable too for a stout at this percentage mild compared to most anything else but surprising in this regard  overall this is what i expected from alesmith a respectful expert brew the base brew is a hallmark an example of how often less is more the barrel aging brings it up a notch while still maintaining that level of composure and elegance i had no doubt that this would be a worldclass offering
5306,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.84,2016 bottle aged for 7 years and cracking it on my last saturday night in my house in georgia

5308,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.73,absolutely amazing
5309,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.65,l motor oil jet black pour from a 12oz bottled chilled into a sniffer  lite foam risen tot he surface looks really thick and oily from the appearance s big notes of chocolate not so much coffee in the nose but ive been surprised in the past by this with chocolatey aromas and big coffee tastes smelling sweet dark cherries bourbon little bit of oak and vanilla very on point with the exception of the coffee t coffee big upfront followed by the chocolate and bourbon dark cherry taste getting the vanilla and oaky barrels here too well done f medium to heavy bodied easy sipper for over 13 not to chewy and surprisingly not to oily o this was a great stout to try ill be buying again soon but definitely worth checking out
5310,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.46,the beer pours a nice brown head that dissipates fairly quickly while the beer itself is a dark chocolate black with a nice glossy sheen to it  the smell is absolutely delicious the bourbon and coffee come out first and followed by a nice mild and soft vanilla alongside a bittersweet dark chocolate there is a noticeable alcohol note that shines through but doesnt really hurt it that much  the taste is phenomenal it has the same notes as the smell with a few additions the oak note is more present in the taste and lasts through the whole thing the bitter coffee note comes out first and the bourbon doesnt show up until towards the finish alongside the chocolate there is also no alcohol notes  the feel is good it has a very smooth body with a tingling feeling from the carbonation it also packs quite a bit of heat for a barrel aged beer  overall this is a delicious beer worth getting and holding for a bit because it definitely tastes like it can develop a bit more fully than it has right now
5311,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.32,appearance black small brown head that fades out after a minute i can hear it fizzing like a coke  smell chocolate wood vanilla coconut nice aroma  taste big chocolate up front nice mild wood and vanilla then finishes with more chocolate very smooth alcohol is well hidden soft feel  overall ive been wanting some barrelaged stouts as the weather is starting to turn colder picked up a single of ba speedway stout its been years since i had the nonba version so cant really compare them the ba was very tasty big chocolate flavor and wellintegrated barrel very good
5312,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.49,2022 edition  pours jet black with no head huge bourbon notes on the nose with dark chocolate and a hint of vanilla detectable  the taste is massive to borrow a term from the beers description im hit with dark fruits leather and tobacco right away while it finishes with a bourbony flourish if theres coffee to be had here its minimal to this palate  this is a great beer nonetheless and really reminds me of bcbs
5313,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.27,look  black thick slight tan head really great rimming and lacing smell  strong booze dark fruit woody roasted malt rich and slight black licorice taste  boozy barrel and woody vanilla roasted malt feel  full body slight bite low carb overall  classic ba stout
5314,The Headless Gourdsman,3.47,the headless gourdsman  from founders four pack of 12 oz bottles on room temperature shelf at riverside liquors grand rapids mi acquired 130923  1800 including tax  0375fl oz reviewed 160923 review 3150 note that i use ddmmyy protocol bottle stamped bottled on 062923 1042 6 stored at 34 degrees at home served at 649 degrees f in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter the final temperature was 680 degrees f appearance  3 first pour  medium amber srm 12 clear body  medium amber srm 12 clear under direct light and when rearlite same head average maximum 4 cm aggressive center pour beige high density quickly reducing to a 035 cm regular crown and a thin complete cap lacing  poor a single irregular wave of small to medium bubbles remains aroma  35  initially very weak generic spiciness no yeast no malt no hops no barrels no ethanol 135  abv according to the label flavor  35  begins slightly sweet with a weak maple overtone and some slight generic spiciness no pumpkin no yeast no malt no hops no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl slight gastric warming very smooth alcohol is well hidden palate  35  medium creamy soft carbonation final impression and summation 35 basically an alcohol delivery system easy to pound and probably not offensive to anyone
5315,The Headless Gourdsman,4.77,2023 barrelaged series release  4 pack 12 oz bottle dated 062923  131 abv   ibu brewed and bottled in grand rapids mi poured into a bells branded tulip snifter glass  look  pours a pretty thin but fluffy offwhite head that leaves a good amount of lacing opaque light to dark red appearance smell  the scent is faint and the spices are dominate nutmeg stands out the most and cinnamon lingers in the background taste  the bourbon is stronger in the taste and the pumpkin spices compliment it well you also get the vanilla and oak from the barrel and the alcohol is almost nonexistent feel  lightmedium bodied with a warm mouthfeel and finishes medium dry overall  this is a fantastic beer the pumpkin spices blend very well with the barrel qualities and it achieves that without a predominate booziness
5316,The Headless Gourdsman,2.95,this one pours a medium dark amber color with a small white head and a little bit of lacing    this smells like scented candle wax dropped into aunt jemimas syrup  it is not appealing    i honestly had pretty high hopes for this one but they were not met in any way this tastes like a syrupy scented candle  the maple syrup just kind of dulls any interesting character there might have been and just blankets an uninteresting bland sweetness on it it really just does taste like a melted candle  the pumpkin and spices just feels so artificial its not a pleasant beer to work through a pour of  this is syrupy with low carbonation and just very little enticing drinkability  this was just a huge swing and a miss for me founders makes some great beers but this is far from one of them
5317,The Headless Gourdsman,4.81,pours dark amber very little lacing aroma rich with strong maple cinnamon and nutmeg notes sweet and malty with a warm blend of fall spices not much heat and finishes with enough bite to keep it from being too sticky delicious dessert beer for when the weather starts turning colder
5318,The Headless Gourdsman,4,pours a dark amber thin foam maple syrup aroma very sweet brown sugar body prominent maple flavor with a slight bitter finish you can taste the alcohol but not too heavy not much of a pumpkin flavor a great fall dessert beer
5319,The Headless Gourdsman,4,pours a dark brown color with a minimal head that disappears quickly aroma of maple syrup and cinnamon taste is very sweet maple with a good alcohol warmth
5320,The Headless Gourdsman,4.12,a  deep cinnamon colored pour with dense frothy light caramel colored lacing and moderate carbonation  s  cinnamon allspice nutmeg soome maple and bourbon  t  bourbon and spice dominate this beer period bourbon vanilla all spice cinnamon and nutmeg are the main spices coming through along with a sweet malt base including maple ends on the sweeter side with a lingering bourbon and pumpkin spice on the palate  m  thick viscous and velvety with some light prickly carbonation fighting through the thickness of the liquid there is some warming in the back of the throat on the way down  o  its a style you either love or hate no one seems to be on the fence i like pumpkin beers therefore  recommended
5321,The Headless Gourdsman,3.82,poured from a bottle into a snifter appearance  the brew pours a deep orangeamber color with a tiny head of off white foam the head fades very fast leaving almost no lacing on the sides of the glass smell  the aroma burst with tons of roasted and toasted pumpkin paired with a good showing of spice and sweet the sweet smells are of caramel brown sugar and maple syrup while the spice is of cinnamon nutmeg and clove there is also a huge presence of oak and a very boozy bourbon smell other aromas of char and smoke as well as some orange and cough medicine are there as well creating a super boozy and rich spiced pumpkin smell overall taste  the taste starts out with a rather robust and thick syrupy roasted pumpkin taste with a decent showing of cinnamon nutmeg and clove there is also a whole lot of doughiness and a huge amount of maple syrup and brown sugar with the alcohol is definitely not hidden right from the start one can taste a bourbon and cough syrup alcohol taste which grows stronger as the taste advances other flavors of oak and a touch of earth develop as the taste advances as well and with the huge alcohol and big pumpkin pie like flavors one is left with a very boozy and thick pumpkin pie strong ale like taste to linger on the tongue mouthfeel  the body is super thick and syrupy while the carbonation level is rather low the feel pairs with the flavors and booziness quite well making for a very slow sipper indeed overall  a little too thick and boozy for me i was expecting something more balanced from founders and was really looking forward to a pumpkin brew but this one was a little too rich for my taste
5322,The Headless Gourdsman,4.33,a 12 oz bottle pours a cherrycola colored seethrough brew with a one finger offwhite head that disappears quickly and zero lacing this looks like no pumpkin ale i have ever seen before the smell is also unique cinnamon ginger bourbon and other spice undercurrents the taste is explosive bourbon a very boozy bourbon maple cinnamon and nutmeg the sweetness is on the verge of overpowering this seems more on the cusp of a very good christmas ale than a pumpkin beer reading the back of the label founders states that no actual pumpkins were harmed in the making of this beer i guess it is more a pumpkin spice beer than a pumpkin beer whatever it is it is a bit cloying and sticky but it tastes very good more like a manhattan than a pumpkin beer the 131 abv kicks ass its clear like a lab created pumpkin beer and lacks the pulp present in the very best pumpkin ales nevertheless its a damn good beer a damn good fall and winter beer a great nightmare before christmas type beer its tasty unique and reccommended
5323,The Headless Gourdsman,3.74,poured a dark amber color with a beige head the tried but failed to cover the surface the aroma is lost on my covid damaged nose the taste  the first couple sips were like gas station cappuccino pumpkin spice flavor it was really odd after warming a bit that impression faded away and there was a relatively tasty barrel aged ale but i couldnt detect pumpkin any longer it finished out this way curiously one dimensional the feel was very good for the abv nicely viscous  this is a sipping beer not a slamming beer oa glad i got a single as im not sure i could have finished the 4 pack not that i thought it didnt taste all right but more that its just not my cup of tea so to speak
5324,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.13,from a 500ml bottle dated 031123 served in a spiegelau tulip glass  pours a thinappearing oakbrown with no obvious highlights a generous finger of lush coffee colored foam doesnt last but maybe 20 seconds leaving a narrow collar and a rousable spatter of oily superslippery lacing  nose is fruity a sweet candylike coffee aroma and totally unexpectedly raspberry  which must be an olfactory hallucination or at least how my brain is interpreting the combination of vanilla cinnamon and chiles  taste is sweet but not heavily so with a berrylike coffee bean flavour and that fruity m√©lange of cinnamonvanillachile pepper that my brain persists in translating as raspberry bringing a brightness and lightness which keeps the beer from tasting syrupy a slick cadburylike milk chocolatey character becomes more evident as the beer warms accompanied by some heat from the chiles theres a very faint soy sauce quality in the aftertaste which doesnt detract much  feel is oilysmooth and creamyslick medium bodied but a little light relative to the style with gentle prickly carbonation chile heat builds up on the palate somewhat and amplifies the otherwise mild carbonation lightening the mouthfeel further  overall pretty good but maybe a little bit of a mixed bag i wont call the flavours muddled but it is a very busy flavour profile which weirdly for my palate comes across very fruity and raspberrylike
5325,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,3.88,2022 pint can chilled left to warm flat black on the pour thick sticky tiny bit of struggled foam that vanished fast smells like cinnamon vanilla cacao nibs and chilli peppers being muddled together tastes the same just too much going on cloyingly sweet and thick slightly gritty too much cinnamon and who needs hot peppers in their stout overall ive attended 5 hunahpus day celebrations at the ccb spruce street brewery over the years and have bought a bottle or can each time and come away thinking the same thing nice novelty but way too busy and quite over rated
5326,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.33,2020 vintage received courtesy of roguer  appearance is typical for the style which means its a nice looking dark dark brown with a half inch of tan colored head nice legs aroma is wonderfully rich and decadent but not in an artificial way plenty of sweet molasses chocolate a hint of vanilla and some faint figs  raisins that description doesnt do this any real justice so in summary this beer smells great  taste is interesting nowhere near as sweet on the nose with some naturally bitter cacao notes cinnamon and pepper combining brilliantly with the base beer the spiciness is goldilocksjust right a bit less and they wouldnt be notable a bit more and they would overpower theres a really nice sweetness deep into the finish that helps add to the complexity of this beer fully bodies and smooth leaving a really nice coating on the tongue with a pleasant alcohol warming  overall this is excellent
5327,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.31,2018 vintage  were nearing the end of the bif beers i got from eziel back in february and this one is a heavy hitter this has been a big want for me for a while so its awesome to finally be able to try it lets see what this famoud spicy stout is really all about  pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  this is highly complex in the nose not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness im picking up on aromas of cacao nibs vanilla bean chili pepper spicy whiskey burnt coffee sweet toffee brown sugar and light charred oak  this is a bit restrained in taste perhaps due to the age but i still really enjoy it on the front end of the sip im tasting dark chocolate roasty coffee chipotle pepper vanilla bean spicy whiskey toasted oak cinnamon and toffee the swallow brings notes of milk chocolate chipotle pepper vanilla bean caramel toasted oak earthy whiskey and burnt coffee  a full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth and earthy beer finishes mostly dry with a lingering heat  while i enjoyed this id hardly put it on legendary status again maybe its the age so id love to try it fresh but even still
5328,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.42,2020 amalie arena editionlarge capped bottle  pours very dark with no light shining through next to no cap or lacing  dark chocolate and fudge brownies on the sniff  super smooth nice complexity exhibited by the notes of more chocolatebrowniescinnamondark malts  delicious creation no doubt aided by a few years in the bottleget some of this fine nectar if ya have the opportunity
5329,312 Urban Wheat,3.75,12oz can date stamp on bottom is 02oct23 cloudy pale gold colored body two fingers of white head retreat to make a cap and ring leaves behind scattered strings of lacing aroma of wheat and floralcitrus hops taste is bright and crisp flavors are wheat malt some yeast and citrus hops aftertaste is of short duration medium mouth feel a little drying good carbonation easy drinking beer with an acceptable not objectionable taste profile
5330,312 Urban Wheat,3.8,i personally like the redesign hardly the reason i tried these tho had first time at a cubs game in the club tried something new nbsoc a new generation miller or meister brau when purchased fresh this actually is a great american beer aroma and flavor provide some cascade hop resin and millennium bittering add a lot of character to this very drinkable beer a lot of people hunt for dry hopped orange juice beer i personally prefer a hoppy lemon grass flavor and that comes nicely with this beer head starts as a great blossom good for this style dissipates sort of fast but does not effect the whole experience if anything drinking it with head into drinking it with no head is part of what adds a hazy character and some dynamic interest to the glass when drinking a deceivingly simple beer minimal malt presence and small noble hop spices draw this style back to a more traditional result as well as some actually quality feeling wheat a lot of elements add to the presence and quality of this beer  definitely will drink again and would recommend for summer gatherings personal recommendation to anyone just trying to have a good beer without a lot of thought and at a great price point tell em colossal cascade hops sent ya hahahahaa
5331,312 Urban Wheat,3.41,i think the cans look dumb but the pour is light and it tastes like a solid hoppy wheat beer overall not bad
5332,312 Urban Wheat,3.44,on tap streeters tavern off campus of loyola april 2023 tasty that beckons for one or two more
5333,312 Urban Wheat,3.47,good for summer overall the smell and taste is kind of simple and not aggressive look clear golden color smell lemony aroma taste light watery smooth not offensive little to null aftertaste
5334,312 Urban Wheat,3.12,i know i have had this many times and was surprised it remained unreviewed at least by me flavor is kind of thin but does have some tartness and citrus notes unfortunately the carbonation strangles the early flavor after which the aftertaste is watery and kind of fizzles out just not close to what im looking for in a wheat beer
5335,312 Urban Wheat,3.5,a light refreshing summer offering it doesnt quite come off as a wheat ale a subtle lemony citrus character with a light biscuit flavor very crushable and good for what it is
5336,312 Urban Wheat,3.51,slightly hazy straw yellow with a modest and short lived white head the aroma is crackers and a hint of lemon the taste is fresh biscuits hints of banana lemon and cloves the body is lightmedium good carbonation level smooth and very drinkable altogether this is a refreshing and enjoyable wheat ale should be good for a warm summer day
5337,Bud Light Platinum,3,bottle share at temperance street with a bit of a mad one pours an ultra pale golden ale looking body with splatterings of white head aroma is bready malts and yeast flavour is
5338,Bud Light Platinum,3.2,handwritten notes from 10 years ago  appearance  clear straw body very clear and pale very active carbonation in the head sounds like a soda more than a beer head lasts for a minute then disappears completely no lace 3  smell  alcohol and musky corn a little thick and gummy very much like a malt liquor 3  taste  stale and musky tastes much better straight from the bottle for some reason pretty clean some faint artificial sweetness like splenda almost flavorless a more alcoholic michelob ultra 35  mouthfeel  slight crispness leaves faint stick on tongue but very clean 3  overall  the ultimate frat beer 3
5339,Bud Light Platinum,1.4,clearly below average for an adjunct smooth alcoholic slightly sour only drank because it was free id much rather drink a corona or even a busch light over this please dont drink this much better adjuncts exist if you want the alcohol without other redeeming qualities then go right ahead
5340,Bud Light Platinum,4.22,i think there are far too many opinions due to this beer being the american beer category but i completely disagree with most of them it doesnt taste or smell disgusting like many reviewers say in fact i truly believe that most of the negative reviews are beer drinkers that typically dont drink light beers or what they call adjuncts but i think this is a fairly decent tasting beer
5341,Bud Light Platinum,2.95,light beers need a different scale the whole point is hopefully getting the best taste possible along with low calscarbs if you can somehow sneak some extra abv in there all the better so this one ticks all of those boxes and this coming from someone who cant stand bud light the taste here is the typical ab soapy water but it isnt offensive especially cold out of a bottle no aftertaste which is good for this style also low on gassiness  yeah of course its far from a quality sipping beer but in terms of the reasons why light beers exist it nails them if youre familiar with another 130 cal 5 carb 60 abv beer let me know all the lightsession ipas of recent years tend to be about 40 abv and taste like overly fizzy junk anyway
5342,Bud Light Platinum,2.3,it looks ok smells ok but tastes of watery corn syrup i used to be ok with it when it was ice ice cold thirsty and wanted some abv now i only have one because its beer 130 calories and 6 abv all in all a great concept but this barely hits it in that delivery in lieu of an ultra it works as to beer to drink for the taste of a good beer skip it
5343,Bud Light Platinum,1.75,dont care how you dress bud light up it still taste like crap there are sooo many better beers than a anheuserbusch product
5344,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,5,i tried this beer out of a bottle is an amazing flavor of apricot and honey lots of yeast that is gathered on top amazingly high carbonation but not overblown probably the most perfect beer for summertime i could ever think of in general one of my top favorites definitely top 10
5345,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.3,gold cloudy very foamy  strong lacing   taste and aroma of lemon pear apples grass a hint of grapefruit and a tiny bit spicy very smooth and refreshing  really great for a blonde ale but not as outstanding as 12 is
5346,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.4,pours a golden blonde color with a near crystal clear transparency head is two fingers of white foam with more build up after a light swirl of the glass this frothy pillowy foam sits a top for a long while after the pour there is visible sediment at the base of the bottle however only the first 34 of the bottle were poured into the glass for this review aroma is punchy grass herbal medicinal and spicy hops with a big cut of spicy yeast just behind this yeast comes paired with clove apple cider and earthy malts it smells light and yet thick that is to say the breadth of notes is pretty simple but the depth to each note is huge flavor profile driven by the same characteristics it pits resiny herbal grassy spicy hops against earthy bready malt undertones clove pairs with spicy yeast for a little further zest and grit mouth feel has a sharp effervescence at least initially effervescence bubbles down to a thin crisp texture it has a medium thickness overall really stellar depth here while remaining easy to drink its on the easier drinking side of the belgium spectrum and yet still retains a remarkable depth  served in a 155oz spiegelau tulip from a 33cl bottle
5347,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,3.66,more yellow than copper lacing foam  clean hops maybe salt no malt  finishes with more than a touch of hops hardly bitter touch of honey nothings really jumping at me  nothing if not easy going and clean and dry
5348,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.56,a lot of the time one simply wakes up because they are alive but not that they want to with westy blond in the fridge though i sprung up like james brown on a line of snow  and  glorious just glorious it doesnt hit you it caresses you like adriana lima putting on a pair of panties  i cant anymore because i need to get back to it  be well be oh so well
5349,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,3.77,blindtasted except for the beers name and brewerycountry zero reviews below read yet l pale gold it was pouring clear until some minor sediment lifted right near the end 3cm creamylumpy white foam head with some sediment left in the bottle there is unusually vigorous ongoing smallbubble rising co2 in the glass holds well and forms lacing on the way down s classic belgian yeast notes lightly estery  a hint of spice overall a bit subtle though t follows the smell but the hops are brighter and dryer than anticipated that was my 1st sip of beer today on swallowing the hops leave a zingy dry brush over my palate that lingers for 10 seconds there might also be a fruit note within it too perhaps apple  in one respect you could feel this is like a hipstered wheatwitweiss beer it has most of the latter notes but the hops are notably amped up f as above bright refreshing one for a hot summers day o its very nice and elegant there is nothing that seems out of place or balance  but apart from what i paid for it is it something seriously amazing well im not pursuaded ive had plenty of other similar style beers to this and this isnt that standout so ill rate it honestly based upon that review 1900 330ml bottle bb not marked though it tastes fresh and i understand this one has a 12month shelflife and the westie 8 and 12 have three years bought from belgium
5350,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.1,shared with a friend on june 6 2021  it looks the part with its light amber golden and very heady pour  the aroma is toasted bread with light belgian yeast it is all very subtle  the body is smooth and light to medium  the taste was sweet toasty and bready with a vague spiciness behind it it was quite a treat
5351,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.92,poured the color of apple cider and was opaque enough to not see through but it seemed to block no light the head was impressive and slow to recede never going away completely beautiful beer the aroma was spice forward and hinted at fruit but i couldnt define which i can say it smelled wonderful the taste followed the aroma spice would lead the way and be enveloped in the malts midway through so enjoyable and refreshing flat out an amazing beer thank you mark for sending this my way
5352,Michelob Light,5,when its fresh its still the best beer ive ever tasted
5353,Michelob Light,3.29,ended up picking up another mystery 6pk and i found one of these within i havent had one of these since 2009 and i remember enjoying it for what it was  l pours a clear golden with a rocky 2 finger white head that dissipates quickly into a very thin white ring minimal lacing to be seen  s subtly sweet malt bread comes first on the nose with mildly spicy and floral noble hops to follow fairly pleasant  t the flavors follow the nose to a t with the mild malt bread beginning and the mild noble hops finish i rather enjoy it for the style  f mediumlight bodied ample carbonation smooth yet finishes short and crisp easily sessionable quite refreshing  o this is pretty fair offering for a light lager is it the absolute best of light lagers available no but it is fair if i went to a friends house and they offered me this i wouldnt mind having one it isnt nearly as terrible as many have made it out to be its great on a hot day and has a great flavor profile albeit a mild one give it a try while grilling out in the summer heat its very refreshing
5354,Michelob Light,4.26,this is a fabulous beer much better than most mass marketed brands it has way way more taste than other light beers such as bud light or coors light really it has sort of a premium quality to it remember weekends were made for michelob
5355,Michelob Light,5,i think anheuserbusch needs to do away with michelob ultra and start producing more michelob light i heard secondhand theyre going to do away with michelob light that be a huge mistake
5356,Michelob Light,2.89,l 35 golden body with ample carbonation and a sudsy white head s 2 nothing much to speak of not pleasant t 325 pretty sweet corn syrup barley f 3 medium bodied heavy mouthfeel for a light lager o 3 prefer the original lager but if youre looking for something like it with even less alcohol by volume then this is your best bet
5357,Michelob Light,5,i hope 5 was the highest rating because i love michelob light ive been drinking it since i began socially drinking i hope that it will still be available because im not a fan of michelob ultra
5358,Michelob Light,4.33,great beer drink it as cold as you can get it on a hot 105 degree georgia day cant be beat
5359,Michelob Light,2.8,12oz bottle coded 21214 poured into a pokal glass at just above fridge temp 41 abv per label the beer pours brilliantly bright pale straw yellow with nearly white head the head recedes to a pencil thin ring and single layer of tiny bubbles the aroma is faint with floral hops and sweet grain the taste is semisweet pale malt with a pretty quick hit of watery diacetyl and some floral and grassy notes mild bitterness the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a not so dry finish overall poor movie butter popcorn is the prevailing note here soapy and sticky on the tongue ice cold or with food you may have something but there are way better light beers to enjoy
5360,Michelob Light,1.77,12oz silver can  so light its almost clear so light it smells like a glass of water you dipped an ear of corn into so light it tastes like a water glass with pennies in the bottom so light you get the picture  i hate this beer
5361,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.62,sweet with subtle fruity flavor dangerously smooth and easy to drink
5362,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.33,750ml bottle  pours a deep ruby brown with offwhite foam head that dissipates slowly smells of sweet dark  dried fruit tastes very sweet with strong notes of dried fruit with a touch of banana and spice a little surypy in texture and finish great little gem of a quad
5363,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.25,first sniff is banana first sip is raisin no hint of the abv until a few sips in it decided to foam at opening but not disastrously very pretty in the glass very smooth going down this could be a dangerous im thirsty beer
5364,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.19,served in a clear pint glass filled with almost no offwhite head from a tap it came its brightly copperamber and just slightly cloudy it provides that belgian smell of yeast and malt with a little hops added its bananalike sweet and unfortunately a bit of bananalike stickiness comes with it but not so much more than others within the style even the great ones to its credit there is also much more than the banana hit the notes described almond and vanilla presence and vanilla is a definite theres also some cinnamon or maybe clove reference that with the abv provides a nice bite overall this drinks mostly sweet and spicy the aforementioned stickiness is much better than it being too thin theres no glass lacing and little alcohol hit which is only an asset to the overall taste this hits all the right notes for a belgian quad so those that love them will love this one
5365,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.18,750 ml bottle into a chalice secret code l19a21 had 82121  pours a medium reddish amber a little cloudy with a one and a half inch foamy head with very good retention and a decent amount of foamy lacing aromas of caramel malt banana spices grapes candi sugar a bit of a sweet aroma as it warms mostly similar flavors caramel malt spices grapes candi sugar some plums a light earthy hop bitterness midway through the finish smooth semi dry a very good medium body well carbonated  this is lighter than typical for the style but matches up well to any quad the grapes and caramel are the most prominent very enjoyable
5366,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),3.57,pours a clear hazelnut brown color with a subtle eggshell colored head  smells of sugared boozy raisins spicy molasses and a note of milk chocolate  has a well carbonated mineralic mouthfeel which despite the beers elevated abv gives it a pleasant refreshment  tastes of rustic bakers chocolate earthy cinnamon and sweet licorice together with a stony carbonation burst offers a nut forward middle part together with caramel and a whiff of honey finishes with a noble spicy dryness among rock sugar and cakey malts  solid with a pleasing depth together with a profound malt backbone establishing a well working balance
5367,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.85,love this beer one of my favorite belgian imports pricy but not as bad as the deleriums or chimays
5368,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),3.94,750ml bottle into a goblet coding hard to understand but may have been bottled this year  splendid looking beer dark reddish brown body big creamy off white head persists in good form throughout impressive given the abv leaving a lot of interesting lacing  nice banana on the aroma there is also something slightly floral which is not as pleasant  on tasting malty banana smooth quite strong but not overly boozy not getting and dark fruit though  mouth full finish warm slightly sweet banana  overall not bad not quite as good as i expected but an enjoyable drink on a snowy pennsylvania night
5369,Pacifico Light,2.74,12oz bottle review from notes  on my journey through the depths of mexican lager i came across this light beer my review is simply that i am glad it has 45 abv bc it is worthless otherwise  refreshing and can possibly get you drunk
5370,Pacifico Light,1.95,very watered down even more than youd expect for a light beer i like the clara a lot more than a traditional mexican lager but unfortunately the light one has much less flavor than clara or even other light beers not bad on the beach but id take a corona or others over this
5371,Red's Rye IPA,4.18,on tap at founders  pours an amber red with a one finger foamy white head smells of caramel and biscuity malt peppery rye pine and citrus peel malty up front with caramel notre mid palate gives citrus zest and pine resin the finish gives some malty sweetness with a citrus linger medium body with moderate carbonation foamy mouthfeel and finish
5372,Red's Rye IPA,4.57,astounded that i have not reviewed this yet it is the single beer that i have never fell out of favor with others come and go as tastes change but this one always hits the sweet spot for me pours a lovely burnished red and sports a manilla colored head for a little while the aroma is hoppy and malty and just an ideal combination of these the taste is where this really shines crisp is the word such a balanced layering of flavors from spices to caramel to citrus and a refreshing bitterness to finish the sip the feel is ideal for the style i am not sure it can be improved oa its always on draft around w michigan which is good as they seldom bottle or can it as it looses flavor quickly or so they say id rather drink an older container of this than not drink it at all really good beer
5373,Red's Rye IPA,4.04,pretty good rye ipa dark amber color with ample white head rye flavored ipa with nice flavor profile and few offputting flavors overall eminently drinkablenot too bitter for an ipa not too sweet well rounded and well crafted
5374,Red's Rye IPA,5,best beer ive ever had
5375,Red's Rye IPA,3.75,355 ml bottle courtesy of cardinal pub  bar stavanger abv is 66 70 ibus reddish brown colour big and lasting offwhite head nice aroma of floral and citrussy hops dry hopped with amarillo also sweetish notes of caramel and orange marmalade the flavour has also notes of orange marmalade and caramel malts but is not extremely sweet there is a distinct hoppy bitterness towards the end with grapefruity and resinous notes lasting through the long aftertaste good stuff
5376,Duchesse De Bourgogne,2.18,i wanted to love it love sours and all kinds of fruit beers but this was not my cup of tea looked wonderful but one whiff of the rotten apple smell put me off thought ok smell isnt great but taste had to be better nope as bad as i didnt like the smell i liked that more than the taste to me tasted like what i would envision nail polish remover tasting like hubby didnt agree with my acetone comparison but he too thought that it was just not good
5377,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.74,opulent  bright acidity balanced with medium carbonation make this beautiful palette cleansing opener bright cherry and balsamic vinegar on the nose wish a dash of barnyard funk tart cherry notes evolve into a sweet but not overly so balsamic vinegar finish that just begs for another sip those who resist will enjoy the long lavish finish enjoy with wild game or short ribs  served in a burgundy glass at around 50 degrees fahrenheit
5378,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.6,the brew is solid dark brown more dull than shiny and opaque a good deal of light is required to catch a reddish tint this serving was drawn from a tap and presented in a clear pint glass on top lays the most marginal of heads thats sort of biege it brings those belgian smells of yeast malt alcohol and some hops the initial taste is a sweet and sour blast more sweet until as it finishes a vinegarlike presence is detected its an enjoyable transition overall this is malty big with not much bite from the hops that makes the sourness even more appreciated theres much less alcohol to taste as there was in the aroma thankfully the oak tannins dont turn this into something that tastes like a boilermaker even without a head nor glass lacing this looks good especially since it went down so rich and smoothly perhaps it will take having a sweet tooth to love this one
5379,Duchesse De Bourgogne,3.84,rather sour pleasantly so with a lemony lactate flavor
5380,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4,nice palette cleanser to start off with good balance of cherry tartness and sweetness the last batch i had in draft was noticeably sweeter than previous versions i taste tested against the bottle and it was obvious i hope it was merely an issue with that barrel and not a change in the recipe otherwise a great beer
5381,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.51,l  brown with bright red hues and highlight with a tan head that dissipates somewhat slowly leaving behind a thin cal s  tons of brett funk bready yeast sweet malts and fruit esters  red berries t  complex brett funk and bright cherry up front and throughout intermixed with notes of caramel bready yeast balsamic vinegar figs and dates maybe even some chocolate f  light bodied with high carbonation o  a truly unique and fantastic belgian ale
5382,Duchesse De Bourgogne,3.64,this tastes like balsamic vinegar with sweet fruity notes woody notes and cheesy notes just like balsamic i love balsamic if you hate balsamic vinegar this is not the beer for you the beer does not feel thick like vinegar  it has a nice drinkable mouthfeel the beer does not look like vinegar  it has a lovely rich dark brown color although it does not look or feel like balsamic it tastes like it a birthday gift from carrie and erik
5383,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.33,dark ruby red on the eyes and red wine vinegar on the nose full of fruit flavor dominated by cherry it is both funkysour and sweet with neither overpowering the other medium carbonation and feels like a wine although maybe my mouth is influenced by my eyes very good i would have one again
5384,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.03,look deep reddish brown with a beautifully thick creamcolored head  smell im immediately reminded of red wine vinegar but not in a bad way oak and some sort of red berry with a distinct musty funk again not in a bad way  taste an elegant mix of sweet and sour but not overall as complex as the nose no real fruit in the taste and not much funk beyond the general sour nature of the style  feel more carbonated than expected thin but not watery  overall one of the most winelike beers ive ever tried i come to this after already trying the sour cherry variant and while i miss the cherries in this version its still an excellent beer and one of the defining examples of its style
5385,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.21,this is a beautiful great tasing beer murky reddish brown color with an absolutely gorgeous fluffy head and outstanding curtain lacing tart fruit smell and taste dark cherries figs dates oak both sweet and tar and a bit funky maybe a tad too sweet very nice beer
5386,Purple Haze,5,has a subtle sweet and tart raspberry flavor and one of the most delightful smelling aromas ive ever experienced i first had this beer back in 2005 and it smells and tastes exactly like it did back then absolutely delicious while the taste is great purple hazes downfall comes in its low abv and high ticket price so its a special occasion only beer i also havent seen it in bottles in my area in a long time at 13 dollars for a 6pk there really should be a bottle option available  style fruit beer  tapcanbottle can  abv 42  rating 5
5387,Purple Haze,3.03,it was okay raspberry taste is a little too strong i honestly expected more i dont know why
5388,Purple Haze,3.71,super solid im a fan of these fruited beers not too sweet
5389,Purple Haze,3.69,love their turbodog picked up a couple of sixers of this on sale for 629 at abc lets give it a whirl popping the top i get faint malt wafts pours to a deep orange with a creamy offwhite head that stands well taste is a nice raspberry pop up front then transitions into a malty middle then the bitterness builds in the end and leaves a clingy bitter aftertaste not sweet but more tart and bitter at the same time a good fruity beer for those who still want some nice bitter hopping i like the fact that it is not sweet and doesnt finish sweet
5390,Purple Haze,3.24,12 ounce well chilt bottle straight up smells like berries but not in a lambic way boones farm ish taste is a bit tart the pilsner and wheat malts along with vanguard hops give balance aftertaste is sweetly floral nothing memorable here0 thin medium carb overall next time i got my gold  purple beads on ill grab one of these little fruity lagers
5391,Purple Haze,3.08,date april 14 2023 occasion watching a sort of homecoming with shan and a beer i hadnt had in a long time glassware sam adams custom lager a hazy dirty yellow body streams tiny bubbles upward into an offwhite ring the opening scents are metallic hops raspberry blueberry smarties chalk and a strange funkyyeasty annoyance that nonetheless gives it a unique memorable aroma slick oily wateryyet refreshingly so some lowend effervescence at the throat the strawberry and blueberry are punchy bright and sweetly interwoven with its bready malts at 4 and change crushable and embracing in its friendship tough to argue with its effect it might not be one worthy of an upclose profile but it will win in the right context or gathering a nice accompaniment for a warm spring night like this
5392,Purple Haze,3.41,ok so its sorta pink  ish in color if back lit its got a mild raspberry aroma under the malt hops may or may not have been used in the latter part of the boil most likely not but maybe the flavor is light raspberry ale with a bit of actual malt sweetness to give it some  not much  body finish is dry with a tart hint of red berry
5393,Hurricane Malt Liquor,2,had that one time at a party back in the day i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included today at 0616 pm edit delete
5394,Hurricane Malt Liquor,1.85,purchased as a single tall can from exxon for 299 poured into a nonic pint glass  l  clear goldenrod with a minimal pale white head s  slight ethanol on the nose corn flakes refined wheat t  same as the aroma but with a little bit of a metallic note ill blame it on the can a little bit like dryer lint as well f  lightbodied with plenty of carbonation really easytodrink if you ignore the taste o  its pretty bad but one of the better macro malt liquors out there not as good as oe800 but better than mickeys ive had this before but this is the only time ive gotten to actually give it a review if youre pregaming before a big trip to a goodwill to look for parts to build a space shuttle this is the brew for you
5395,Hurricane Malt Liquor,1.17,drainpour
5396,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.12,l a very nice clear hold with a hint of amber and a full white head that quickly dissolves into a thin ring and islands s corn malts no hops or off aromas t okay a mild corn sweetness with some apple or pear a bit of buttered biscuit and the slightest hint of hops f mildly carbonated slightly sweet at the front of the swallow fairly smooth going down and leaving a very slight pepper on your tongue and a slightly bitter sweet aftertaste o this is the driest and lightest tasting on the malt liquors ive tried you can tell it shares the ab bloodline in a blind test hurricane could easily be mistaken for one of the budweiser or busch beers if you like bud youll probably like hurricane
5397,Hurricane Malt Liquor,2.38,the head fizzled away fairly quickly but there are still a large amount of bubbles forming an rising to the top to quickly have their gas escape into the world  the nose is a mix of malt and weak brown sugar sweetness and metallic medicinal notes that are filling in for hop bitterness in an unsuccessful attempt its actually somewhat offputting  luckily the taste avoids the aromas pitfall its actually not that bad it has a little bit of toast mixed in with the sweetness that it brings and its not overly sweet by any means theres a generic bitterness that i might argue is slightly woody maybe it had some contact with some beechwood chips theres a slight unripe banana note in the aftertaste  the nose hurts this a lot and warmth isnt its friend but there were some parts that werent so bad drinking fairly cold was better
5398,Hurricane Malt Liquor,2,another downer i had its high gravity counterpart and while it was below average it was much closer to average than poor this one is right at the 2 level that separates poor from terrible pours mostly clear yellow aroma is sweet and grainy but something is off taste is sweet in an unpleasant way not overly sweet just not a good sweet
5399,Hurricane Malt Liquor,2.19,this is by no means a great beer but it is my preferred lol malt liquor 25 oz can ice cold goes down smooth and easy 2 cans for 3 at the local weis sold seriously its malt liquor but in my opinion one of the better ones offered cheers
5400,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.51,40 oz clear bottle category 5 6 alcvol 18292 code purchased cold decanted into tulip  l crystalclear brassycolored liquid topped with loose bouncy offwhite suds which collapse in 2 min actually several boogers of lace gets chunkier with longer rings with each pour also keeps a collar  s dried grass dried flowers musty burlapcardboard soft hint of skunk underlying hang of cereallike graininess kixforward faint metallic overtone dull presence of alcohol  t dominant note front and center of a mildlysweet hard candy with a dull citrus andor butterscotch flavor  havent tasted quite this shade of malt syruposity in any other malt liquor kind of a champagne soda aftertaste with a very delicate spicy phenol lingering as well as a faint nutty husk note  f with first pour very little carbonation to excite the palate even with subsequent pours kicking up a tall head it doesnt translate to anything remotely prickly on the tongue the body starts with a mild oily grip but immediately thins out leaving no impression of dimension rather delicate warmth stirs after each sip  o skunk not as bad as others goes down pretty easy and it grew on me but id recommend drinking it colder to avoid the odd hard candy element  its not that bizarre of a flavor for something like this seemed to trail off but lacks a secondary flavor to balance it at any rate surprised at its relative quality  didnt intend to but drank almost the whole bottle
5401,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.47,decent malt liquor picked up a six of pint cans while out of town aroma is sweet fruit and corn flavor tracks with green apple and grape making an appearance with a grassy finish cheap easy drinking
5402,Hurricane Malt Liquor,4.37,my daily driver preferred beer in my book i drink about 3 25oz cans a day dont know why i prefer over other beers i dont get drunk on this beer i dont know why my tollarence is so high
5403,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.73,perfect if you want to get hammered make sure to get the 40oz love the taste but it varies on bottle to bottle sometimes ill get one and it smells and tastes like cough syrup probably due to too much bleach during the sterilization process other than that in idaho the abv is 81 but ive seen others like ny la nc and ca that are locked in at 59  6 great malt though definitely recommend you to try it if youre wanting to get drunk
5404,Hurricane Malt Liquor,4.7,appearance nice golden with a very thick white head aroma sweet malty corny ricey lots of white breadiness low hoppinessnot much taste very sweet malty corny ricey white breadiness and decent hop bite mouthfeellightmedium with a lightmedium body overall its a great malt liquor to try from abinbev a nice well rounded beer flavored malt liquor with a slight fruity note better than king cobra in my opinion would recommend
5405,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.05,as hurricane with category 5 on the label but the abv listed at the top of the label as being 6 abv  not 81 or 58 or 59 abv as ive seen on other hurricane branded beers  malt liquor 6 abv 138 kcal per 12oz  57739 kj per 12 oz 000 fat per 12 oz 420 carbohydrates per 12 oz 90 protein per 12 oz  ingredients water corn rice andor dextrose syrup barley malt hop extract yeast  glass bottle in the classic 40oz format purchased at a 711 in manhattan for 331 including tax and deposit clear glass branded black screwoff cap  pours a clear pale copper body  obviously filtered  below an offwhite cap of mediocre consistency and above average retention 57 minutes  aroma hints at graininess in addition to decently disguised corn adjunct cheap 6row barley and pale malt inoffensive doesnt suggest a syrupy or watery beer but im reading it as on the thicker side based on this aroma hop profile isnt completely absent i think i get some mild grassiness suggests an innocuous malt liquor with no egregious flaws but plenty of shortcomings in terms of complexity depth of flavour subtlety balance and build aromatic intensity is below average doesnt seem boozy and i detect no offnotes  taste is indeed innocuous and inoffensive which is high praise for a malt liquor sure theres a bit too much 6 row and pale malt sweetness as well as corn adjunct and its a bit too thick but it isnt syrupy or watery and it isnt cloyingly sweet or overly adjunctemphatic ive certainly had worse and theres a slight scintilla of grassy hop flavour to its credit  certainly not dialedin but its not imbalanced shallow and simple but approachable and pleasant enough for a 6 abv malt liquor offered in the 40 oz format lets be fair  theres far worse out there this may be a bit insipid but that isnt always a bad thing in the budget beer category  texture is slightly overcarbonated and crisp unrefreshing owing to its slightly syrupy feel and overly thick presence on the palate has too much weight on the palate for a beer as insipid as this not oily gushed tannic astringent rough hot boozy or scratchy this mouthfeel doesnt elevate the beer as a whole or accentuate specific flavours but it also doesnt clash with the taste  overall its mediocre at best but its one of the better least bad attempts at the style ive tried recently 299 usd plus tax and deposit is as fair a price as youll find in manhattan for such an inoffensive brew and this is probably up there with ballantine xxx in terms of my goto budget 40oz format brews many will shit on this because it happens to be brewed by anheuserbusch but in a blind taste test im confident itd outperform most competing brands judging it strictly to style its actually pretty decent fare and i wont mind taking down the entire 40oz bottle  low c 305  above average
5406,Troegenator,3.8,malty background yes but not overwhelmingly so forward sweetness not recommended on an empty stomach
5407,Troegenator,3.9,12oz bottle best by 82123  poured at fridge temp into a tulip glass  pours a deep coppery brown and crystal clear clarity with a 2 finger tan head quickly settled into a fair ring and loose cap 4  off the bottle i get lots of dark but freshripe stonefruit mostly plum fig but also something brighter and sweeter dates maybe whatever it is its awesome 4  chocolate malt is clear and gentle deep ripe plum and toasted grain slight alcohol warmth but its barely perceptible 375  full and chewy body but not syrupy or too thick carbo is moderate and lingering grain  stonefruit is great 4  overall a delightful and well roundedcrafted beer enjoyable warm or cold 4
5408,Troegenator,3.94,tastes like a classic double bock but is flat and should have much more foam and carbonization  there are better out there
5409,Troegenator,4.11,drank 2 for this rating one warmed for a few minutes and one straight from the fridge  pours somewhere between copper and amber slightly hazy with a quickly dissipating 35 finger khaki head  smells upfront mildly of hops and definitely of malt maybe a tiny bit of lemon  tastes very sweet initially followed by caramel with an aftertaste of dried fruit with very little bitterness throughout i notice more bitterness the more i drink but it still remains very low i still taste the caramel notes during the second bottle i began tasting toast and bread very good malt tastes in this beer  this is extremely smooth likely the smoothest non stoutporter ive had  absolutely willing to buy this again as a 6 pack which is how i bought this to celebrate german beer day price was decent so thats another thing in its favor
5410,Troegenator,4.17,dark brown with a bready aroma taste hints of caramel pumpernickel good balance as it warms
5411,Troegenator,3.5,pours a deep amber no foam stone fruit aroma sour fruit body nutty finish tastes like a fruitcake not really my style
5412,Troegenator,4.18,awesome beer for the winter season although i have easily enjoyed one or two during summer i prefer ipas but this is a really good double bock very rich and heavy not for amateurs 0
5413,Troegenator,4.25,freshest by 32923 drank 122322  pokemon communion  semiopaque brownpurple appearance  nice khaki head decent lace  plum caramel  leather notes in the nose  medium thick mouthfeel  plum leather  caramel flavors up front mild booze heat  faint banana notes on the finish  sweet but easy drink  quite enjoyable
5414,Coors Non-Alcoholic,3.22,poured from a brown 12 oz bottle has a pale straw color with a 12 inch head smell is of grains light malts taste is the same as the aroma some notes of corn feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall its refreshing and somewhat flavorful considering the abv
5415,Coors Non-Alcoholic,1.84,i dont ever drink non alcoholic beer but i tried a few of them in a lineup recently to asses the best and the worst and next to heineken and buckler this is without question the worst of the three its intolerably bad where the others had some beery redeeming elements this i almost had to spit out its shockingly sweet has no real malt flavor though at all and doesnt get crisp enough in the finish to fake its way to being a lager like if i wanted a coors and i got this it wouldnt scratch the itch even a little bit the carbonation is the only thing they got right its awful i think its cool that there are some craft options for non alcoholic beers now some of them are good too but even still in the macro realm there are a lot better options than this one and i feel sympathy for anyone who is stuck with these if i was a bar i would carry anything but this as an option it seems like something they could revisit and improve im sure its only a small fraction of their business but they really should this is a turnoff of the highest order
5416,Coors Non-Alcoholic,3.53,clear pale gold with two fingers of white five minute head good amount of lace the smell is sweet grain bin taste is sweet bread dough malt with a tiny note of grassy hops mouthfeel is thin with strong carbonation the finish is dry and sweet overall a good looking beer with just a hint of beer character
5417,Coors Non-Alcoholic,1.95,coors nonalcoholic served in a pint glass  look straw color with brilliant clarity head is bright white with great head retention and a meringuelike head with small bubble texture  smell high levels of bready yeasty malt aromas that are followed up by moderate levels of sulfur presumably from the bottom fermenting lager yeast seems somewhat high for a lager however no detectable hop aromas which causes the beer to smell overly malty similar to oldstale beer  taste bready malt flavors followed by the yeast flavor low levels of hop bitterness with a low level of grassy spicy hop flavor hops are barely detectable sulfur and dms flavors are low to moderate more moderate as the beer warms balance is all malt bready and fermentation character yeast sulfur dms not a pleasant drinking experience  feel moderate levels of carbonation light bodied no lingering harshness or creaminess no alcohol warmth obviously mouthfeel is typical of adjunct lager style  overall beer looks good and the mouthfeel is typical but the aroma and flavor are pretty terrible i wouldnt drink this unless i had to best bet is to find a better nonalcoholic beverage
5418,Coors Non-Alcoholic,2.66,comparing only na beers bud light and miller lite not my favorite sierra nevada pale ale the color was a nice straw yellow this na beer poured with a 2 finger head that disappeared quickly it gave off a nice light beer aroma from the head the taste was that of beer malt and hops flavored seltzer water the overall taste and body was that of miller lite without any corn taste
5419,Coors Non-Alcoholic,4.61,i travel a lot for my sons high school athletics and enjoy a few good beers when i get home sometimes it takes a couple of our and do not want to risk a dwi i found the coors na on the shelf and thought i would give it a try i was blown away with the taste i could not believe how great it tasted for a na beer it totally satisfies my craving for the beer taste without the alcohol in my system for driving the only problem i have is finding it i was just in walmart and bought the last 6 pack will buy more if i can find it
5420,Coors Non-Alcoholic,3.04,coors na really catered to my tastes with a breadlike light taste it was a crisp smooth and overall pretty nice experience ive tried alot of nas on the market and this was definitely one of my favorite
5421,Coors Non-Alcoholic,2.25,apours a straw color with a slight head and lacing aaroma has slight malt hints tthe taste follows the nose with a slight malt flavor ma light bodied well carbonated beer oa decent beer
5422,Boskeun,4.1,330ml bottle into a tulip no bottled on date but likely a few years in the bottle  hazy golden yellow body with a persistent white head yeasty aroma and the taste adds a warming sweetness to it
5423,Boskeun,4.6,one year old can to wine glass  l pours a slightly opaque golden brown with an extremely stable pillowy white head that leaves plenty of lacing some tiny yeast floaters visible  s herbal grassy and fruity with notes of fresh bananas malty and minimally sweet  t herbal and spicy malty and hoppy sweet and bitter fruity and earthy dominant notes of ripe bananas and honey  f full and crushable at the same time medium carbonation quite warming  o full of contrasts yet nicely balanced and very complex tastes like a classic belgian blonde with a twist and definitely sticks out of the mass great modern interpretation of the style very well crafted
5424,Boskeun,4.21,pours a hazy i always aspirate my yeast back in deep orange colour plenty of bubbles run up the side of the glass supporting an incredibly dense head that has these big rocky bubbles at the top gorgeous honestly  a sweet mild herbal and yeasty aroma banana and general phenolic spices present as well  all my last reviews have been simple taste follows the nose but not this one the aforementioned aromas are present in the palate but its quite a complex and interesting flavour profile first off the abv is present but in a complementary way it inflects off of the delicious yeasts and drives up the spicy phenolic character quite a bit cloves cinnamon on the back end cardamom not sure if thats what im thinking but theres something else in there too  banana bread honey the floral notes in the aromas are transformed into more earthy tones here maybe this sounds strange but apple peel usually i taste fruit in beers its just apple or pear rarely peel unless its citrus zest in hop forward beers but i get a real apple peel flavour here  mediumlight bodied with moderate carbonation that is fairly active lightly tickling bubbles beer definitely leans to the dryer side on the finish and despite the sweet notes that are all throughout the beer the dryer finish brings out the bitterness thats present in the background of this beer  well if i knew this was an easter beer i wouldve saved it for easter but only after i cracked it did i read it was a beer ive never ever seen in canada nor will we likely ever this was a special gift from a friend who brought it back from the good ol united states its beautiful looking complex and delicious goodness me i wish i had another one to open on easter oh well what can you do this is belgian goodness in a bottle id honestly say im liking it as much as orval and ive got 5 of those in my cellar hope to be able to get another one of these soon
5425,Boskeun,4,present from diamonds des who floats around the globe big blonde beauty with frothy white head candy notes in the flavour nice kick at the tail end of the flavour

5427,Boskeun,4.85,one of the best beers ive ever tasted loved every sip drank the 9 version and hated to swallow it
5428,Boskeun,4.1,on tap at armsby abbey clear golden with an ample white head smells of herbal notes earthy belgian yeast sweet golden malts and some booze tastes fruity with herbal undertones sweet honey some slightly deeper maltiness and spice and clove from the yeast boozy fairly sweet and pretty heavy but quite tasty

5431,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,3.4,had about a 5oz pour from a 40 just to sample it really didnt pick up any off flavors at all fairly easy to drink im sure a headache would result if you drink more than 12oz of this however
5432,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2,had that one time at a party back in the day i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included
5433,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2.99,poured into a 12oz glass from an undated 25oz can  on the pour a decent 15 finger white head formed the head has decent retention but its a pretty fast dissipation to a thinner cap the body is a solid gold with lots of fine carbonation  aroma us a bit rough some off apple juice and a bit of a funky lager a bit malty other than that but meh  taste has a bit of off flavor there is a nice malty sweetness right off the bat and its quite attenuated and stays pretty balance there is a twinge of tartness but for the style this is decent biscuity finish with a hint of corn  feel is drinkable and relatively crisp but its not the most chuggable beer with some odd esters here and there medium finish with a pretty neutral mouthfeel   overall for the style this is pretty good i still prefer colt 45 or mickeys but this is a lot better than oe or hurricane not bad for a cheaper buzz
5434,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,3.77,the first time i ran across this beer was 30 years ago in jacksonville fl i was in florida for the daytona 500 and swung by the anheuser busch brewery in jacksonville on the way to daytona at that time my beer palate wasnt all that developed and the extra malt flavor of this beer was appreciated since i was drinking pilsners at the time 30 years later i stumbled across the 25 oz cans in a local gas station i never said it was highbrow and decided to give one a shot upon arriving home i cracked the can open and poured most of the beer into a 16 oz glass the color is light for a malt and the head is respectable due to the fairly high carbonation the first sip brought back memories of the caramelmalt flavor i remembered from years ago it was refreshing and was a good match for the 102degree heat this is not a complex beer nor is it something that one would go to the ends of the earth for however it is a good cold beer for a hot afternoon and has fallen back on my lawnmower beer list
5435,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,5,goes down super easy but dont let the smooth taste fool you this beer packs a punch which makes it a staple in my house whenever i can find it but lately something has been afoot at the circle k and i cant find it anywhere pours a nice golden color gives you a little head doesnt have a disturbing odor satisfies your thirst when you take the plunge and doesnt make you regretful in the morning
5436,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2.27,40ozer  no date  i bought this in honor of kingcobrajfs thats whats up looks like urine and doesnt taste much better intense blast of corn mixed with a touch of grassy hops and garbage can juice  shout out to my cool cobras out there twu

5438,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2.27,pours golden yellow with a 1 white head which fades to a wisp moderate lacing  aroma is grassy bready faint sweetness  taste is the usual corn associated with cheap beer bready grass light maltiness slight sweetness  light body moderate carbonation dry finish  as far as malt liquor goes this one is fairly ok

5441,Old Milwaukee Beer,2.77,12oz can date stamp on bottom for best by is oct0923 clear straw colored body thin fizzy white head small lacing spots are left behind aroma of faint grain malts and a slight fruity hops taste is slightly sweet from the grain malts sulfur note later in the profile wet cardboard malt in the aftertaste thin mouth feel and not much else except for the fizziness okay carbonation americas beer or so it says on the can this is an acceptable cheap beer and provides a buzz but not much of a reward for getting there
5442,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.63,light color like a blonde very lacy i poured like in that miller ad and it created a big fluffy head smells like 1970s to 1980s bar without the cigarettes  surprisingly malty leaves a feeling of both meaty heavy and refreshing light  as a side note the last time i tasted this i was a minor about 10 or 11 yrs old i have tried beer since i was a toddler only little sips and all mostly dixie and this one but after dixie closed down it was mainly this now dixie has reopened and was pressured to change its name to faubourg because dixie is offensive to some people hope the bring blackened voodoo back
5443,Old Milwaukee Beer,4.15,poured from a can into a pint glass has a nice thick head that slowly fades lots of carbonation bubbles light gold in colour smell is wet grains taste is barley with some corn finish is dry good  edit a couple minutes later still have a thin head much like a draft beer
5444,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.61,16oz can best by 73123 pours a clear golden color with a finger of foamy white head grainy wet cardboard smell light body with plenty of carbonation sweet corn flavor with a strong floral hop finish not understanding the low ratings this is pretty much a classic aal you dont have to like the style but this is good for what it is
5445,Old Milwaukee Beer,3,poured from a 16oz can best by june 5th 2023  on the pour about a finger of head that quickly recedes to a thin cap body is light straw yellow high carbonation  aroma is very dry but there is a slight skunky sulfur note that isnt very pleasant hops are present but they add to the smell in a strange skunk boosting way like a lower quality mexican lager maybe some light alcohol is on the nose  taste loses a lot of the hop character except for right up front with a slightly spicy or zezty and herbal but cheap hop note immediately malt and corn character build in a crackery and popcorny way while maintaining a dryness  feel is surprisingly full bodied with a slight dryness but medium long grainy moutcoating finish  overall this is an interesting beer the aroma made me think it was going to be worse than it was but surprisingly refreshing once on the palate the hop notes also make this beer unique for a pabst product
5446,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.14,l light straw color nice white top that disappears quickly s corn syrup not much else t i drank many of these years ago and old mil had a distinct flavor that set it apart from other aal not anymore f very light smooth nothing to report o sub par aal i picked up a 30 pack and i am having trouble finishing over many weeks i would suggest hamms or modelo especial or strohs over this beer
5447,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.53,way underrated  especially considering the style which essentially is classic old style milwaukee adjunct lager like what was served in midwest bars in the 70s and 80s accept it for what it is  extremely drinkable kind of creamy easygoing moderately light tho with acceptable taste yes ranging from malt to hops and reasonable body if it was more expensive   everyone would probably give it get a higher rating   and if youre lucky    you get the version with the 1940s pinup girl on the label  perfect
5448,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.6,could be worse  could be bud light miller lite or shudder to think coors light
5449,Old Milwaukee Beer,2.92,355ml can poured into kitchen glass i dont intend to let it warm up  might be the palest beer i ever poured pours a pale straw yellow with one finger of sudsy white head that leaves some decent chunks of lace as it recedes  smells of white bread crispy corn flakes faint flowers and a bit of veggie hops  tastes of more bready malt corny adjunct and more faint veggie floral hops  feels light and fizzy light bodied with bubbly carbonation finishes offdry its warming a bit and the taste of corn is getting more annoying  verdict not recommended not very good but i cant really complain probably good after mowing your lawn but then again so is weihenstephaner
5450,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.38,found a 12 pack of cans for under 11 bucks in a ghetto liquor store after work its nj remember they pull your pants down check to see if your socks match and may as well stick a gun in your face for how expensive everything is in this dump state drier than a high life possibly better than a pbr fine lasting head great lacing dry finish recommended  brewed in latrobe pa
5451,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.26,this beer is the epitome of an adjunct lager if you like this style i cant see why you would rate this beer poorly or awful as ba reviewers did its crystal clear highly carbonated color leans more yellow than gold taste follows aroma nothing out of the ordinary does lack depth and finish is a bit course but overall easy drinking good hot weather beer 6 pk 16 oz was 499  tax if you like adjuncts this is a good choice
5452,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.19,doesnt deserve the awful rating a lot better then most of the massproduced pig vomit that is out there perfect summer fun beer
5453,BDCS,4.48,sampling a cellar temp 12 oz can poured into my snifter vintage 2022 but no other date stamp on the label received in a trade courtesy of russpowell thank you  the beer pours a rich dark coffee brown color and no light passes through my glass when i hold it to a light source a dense creamy head of 1 cm of tan foam rises up from the pour and quickly fades to a sturdy edge layer that sticks around throughout my sampling there are also a few small islands spinning in the center of the glass also get some scattered lacing when i swirl the glass or take a sip aroma is malt forward with milk chocolate vanilla brown sugar and a good whiff of bourbon note no warm or fusol alcohol more of the sweet side of bourbon also no hop presence here at all on the nose first sip reveals a very smooth textured medium bodied beer with fine soft and gentle carbonation the carb is very fine and gentle which all makes for a velvety smooth physical experience flavor is what the nose advertises with sweet chocolate brown sugar and some vanilla all giving way to bourbon notes and a little warming on the swallow bourbon flavor lingers and also coats my lips i do get a little bit of a coffee note in the back of each swallow too again no hops to be found quite a nice imperial milk stout one that i would gladly drink again

5471,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),2.22,pabst blue ribbon one of the most cheapest and popular beer on the market  you have that corny smell the smell is not offensive  the taste is like the smell but on the finish its terrible and the after taste is not that great at all maybe is because of the agent than sleeman put in their pabst but hey its drinkable and this is one of the best economic beer on the market  would i recommend it  sure for the price u can t go wrong with that  would i buy it again  no
5472,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),3,l transparent yellow no bubbles or head s semi sweet and alcoholic grainy corn and skunky apple lager notes t similar to the smell its not overly sweet and it is somewhat flavorful although its not the best tasting the taste leans towards the warm malts with some skunky hoppiness not very bitter or drying f medium body a bit foamy feeling little carbonation o not as good as i remember but not bad probably better with food than drunk alone
5473,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),3.15,first time i tried this canadian version and the only reason was it was made by sleemanpoured a clear pale gold with a 2 finger puffy white cap that lastaaromas are demure bready malts some grassinessflavor is rounded and malty with enough hopping to balance clean drty finish from brewers rice hops become more evidentbready taste at the endactually a very decent preprohibion american lager malty dry enough hops to be balanced quenchingno down side here
5474,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),2.64,i have had this in bottles and cans but im basing this review of when i had it on tap which is my most recent tasting of the brew its good for a lowbudget aal and is nicely carbonated and was very crushable on a night out i love my craft beers trappist beers many different beers but i judge beers by type im not comparing it to a st bernardus abt 12 that would make no sense at all i like it much better than coors light or molson canadian which are the usual beers on tap at the karaoke bars here in the can pbr is not very good though
5475,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),2.29,have drank this stuff many times and i never really liked it much its an ehh beer tastes ehh looks ehh feels ehh been around forever and i even have a friend who swears by this beer i prefer to swear at it
5476,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),4.18,it is an amazing cheap beer sure its not premium beer but for the price you cant go wrong it pours about 2 fingers thick with a fast fading head smells like a sweet malty hoppy beer i swear i thought i smelled apples for a split macro second lol its kinda like how you wish budweiser tasted like its got a sweet taste again i almost think of apples even tho its clearly not in the taste pallet but still you can taste the hops or grains for sure so that ads to the authenticity of the lager a surprisingly nice amount of carbonation and might be too much for some though as i hate micro lagers they remind me of fizzy pop bleck very smooth going down and can easily drink 6 cans without a problem but then be in a problem cause ive just pugged 6 cans of some good brew and might need to take a walk and have a cup of coffee leaves a slight bitter aftertaste but nothing special for the price this beer is friggen good
5477,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),3.49,overall the best bottomshelf aal that is widely available hands down there are others that i like better but are hard to find or overpriced cant go wrong with pbr
5478,IPA,3.46,fourteen years ago when i moved from california to massachusetts it was the first local beer i fell in love with it was always a lot better on draft than from the bottle and i still will order it at logan airport or in boston restaurants if nothing that holds great appeal to me is available its a little too bland for my taste now still a good solid ipa
5479,IPA,4,just looking through all the ratings and reviews this beer has garnered during its long run and cannot find anything new to add except to reemphasize many of its fine qualities from its handsome appearance to the tasty balanced finish it is a solid well made 4 that has not abandoned its roots
5480,IPA,4.32,appearance clear amber fluffy white head with good retention  aroma citrus and toasted bready malt  flavor citrus toast and bread moderately sweet moderate bitterness  mouthfeel drying moderate carbonation medium length finish  overall another iconic old school ipa pours a clear amber color producing a nice fluffy white head with good retention the cascade and cluster hops provide citrus aromas of grapefruit and oranges that distinguish the nose you also get some toasty bread hints from the lightly roasted malts tastes include citrus notes combined with the sweet malt that you would expect from a beer of amber color bitterness is quite restrained however the sweetness is as well giving it a nice balance between the two it finishes on the dry side with a medium aftertaste well crafted classically balanced ipa
5481,IPA,3.57,pours a slightly cloudy deep golden orange 15 soapy head with good retention and lacing nose is malt and roasted barley with a nice background note of pine and earthy spice taste is also malt forward though theres enough hop presence to keep things balance would like a bit more bright spicy hop but this still satisfies mouthfeel is moderate with light carbonation
5482,IPA,3.67,good traditional ipa certainly more balanced than many out there today
5483,IPA,3.75,12 oz bottle pulled out of a cooler full of ice water nice genie of steam rises from the bottle when popped open smells original classic ipa tastes like an un fussied with ipa its hoppy crisp malt balanced feels carbed and smooth tingly overall just an ipa in the fondest of terms
5484,IPA,3.92,i havent had this ipa for a while good to revisit in light of all the unbalanced weird flavored ipas ive been tasting in the past few years mildly hoppy good malt backbone standard fare good go to ipa
5485,IPA,1.76,real bad
5486,IPA,3.75,a solid starter ipa of the traditional back in the day variety i drank a ton of it for a while  similar to but inferior to in every aspect the great snpa
5487,IPA,3.74,pours a slightly hazed gold body with a billowing white frothy foam head that has moderate retention and leaves a ton of thin sticky sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a patchy froth cap with defined halo  aroma is sweet and grainy malt forward with floral and slightly piney hops on the wings  taste is sweet and juicy with a floral flair up front that fades to an earthy light bitterness tinged with pine with the finish  mouthfeel in fairly thin bodied with high carbonation running slightly watery and grainy with a pillowed juicy edge before finishing mildly dry and leaving a slightly sweet herbal aftertaste tinged with earthy bitterness  overall solid session ipa that runs mostly sweet and juicy but manages a solid balance thanks to a cascade hop bittersweetness wouldnt consider it one of the greats but its in the top 15 for me as far as highbrow craft ipa flagships
5488,IPA,3.22,not one of the better ones i have had from harpoon but still solid enough to enjoy comparatively speaking its not as sweet smelling or juicy as others but the mouthfeel was fullbodied which made up for a less than favorable taste again when you take it all in its solid just not necessarily memorable
5489,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.02,i love the intensity it is a treat
5490,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.1,notes from 201112 12oz bottle into a pint glass l copper fairly clear lite tan head s caramel candy earthy and fruity t malty sweet with a fine hop bite that doesnt go too far some pine lingers f fairly smooth drinking with a medium heavy mouthfeel on par with lagunitas o reminds me of a christmas ale but not as bitter excellent

5492,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,3.93,the pour from a tap into a plain pint glass brings an amberbrown fluid closest to 16 on the srm chart theres a nice light biege head atop but attention quickly shifts to the enticing malty hop aroma there is rich body here as evidenced by all the pretty glass lacing the initial taste is good malty but with some hop contributions what kills the enjoyment is the cloyingly sweet after taste if a honey like finish to a beer sounds good here it is
5493,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4,12 oz bottle pours a deep amber in color with a beautiful creamy beige head that leaves sticky sheets of lace in the glass strong hop aromas of grapefruit and pine full bodied with a thick creamy mouthfeel flavors of pine and grapefruit more of a strong ipa
5494,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.91,this here is the one that turned me onto american pale ales  i think apa is now my favorite beer and its thanks to undercover investigation shutdown and others like it  doesnt look or smell too special but it tastes like a million bucks for the high abv you mostly just taste the hops and it is delish  one of my top 5 beers i always look for and enjoy in season  great job lagunitas
5495,Old Milwaukee Light,2.64,from a 12oz can  appearance pale yellow good head  smell mild malt hint of sourness  taste mild sweetness light corn flavor very mild bitterness in the finish  overall grabbed an extra after softball for a review pretty decent light beer some flavor and even a bit of bitterness easy drinking and inexpensive i might have to grab it instead of miller lite on occasion
5496,Old Milwaukee Light,3.97,old mil has a beer i drank when i was in college because of the price when i was in college was 9 bucks a case and as i have got older its made a resurgence in my area after being on a single case stack at the local beer store they now carry it by the pallet this beer is extremely smooth and to many drinkers tastes like beer nothing offensive but does not blow you away can basically copy and paste this to the old mil premium but no point to go with premium due to no noticeable taste difference and just higher calories edit review this beer has replaced busch light as my go to beer combination of flavor and cost there is a reason that this product has won so many award and is the most award winning light beer regardless of hipsters and fanboys wanting to trash it because it is a cheaper beer people need to realize that just because a beer costs more does not mean it is better
5497,Old Milwaukee Light,3.78,12 ounce can into lager glass best before 9232019 pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation aromas of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit wood pepper and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness a bit of fruity corn aromas but not overwhelming nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale maltgrains and lightmoderate earthy hop notes with solid strength taste of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit wood pepper and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness light herbal floral woody grassy peppery bitterness on the finish lingering notes of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit wood pepper and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit very nice robustness and balance of pale maltgrains and lightmoderate earthy hop flavors with a great maltbitterness balance and no astringent flavors after the finish fairly crispclean finishing very clean on lager flavors with minimal fruityyeasty notes lightmoderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation mediumplus carbonation and light body with a very smooth moderately breadygrainy and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great zero warming alcohol as expected of 38 overall this is a very nice light adjunct lager all around nice robustness and balance of pale maltgrains and lightmoderate earthy hop flavors very smooth crisp clean and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitterdrying finish very flavorful and not watery for the abv nice clean pils maltgrain showcase with great earthy hop presencebalance for the style not overdone on adjuncts minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness a very enjoyable offering and outstanding style example one of the best macro light lagers ive had as expected of pabst
5498,Old Milwaukee Light,4.88,i usually drink labatt light blue royal or milwaukees best light but old milwaukee light was 50 cents cheaper than the best light i tried it nice clean sweet taste it didnt have foam overkill like best light overall a much better buy than bud light miller light or coors light best bang for the buck
5499,Old Milwaukee Light,2.42,pretty sure i had this before pabst acquired them was never a go to but was cheap easy to drink and readily available it comes in at just below halfway between poor and average
5500,Old Milwaukee Light,2.42,from notes taken 092417  very pale and clear straw gold lemonwhite cap of fine uneven fluff with surprisingly good retention nose is faint lemon sweet not sour pinch of yeast some grass light grain palate adjunct but not distractingly so no honey suggestions which is good overall like mineral water with a few drops of lemon and melon juice pretty standard fare refreshing enough light in body with tight spritzy carbonation
5501,Old Milwaukee Light,2.67,an hour before my buddys wedding in bascom oh this week i decided more emergency beer was needed for possible late night so i ran down the road to tiffin to pick somehing up and this was what i ended up with i was going to do the regular old mil but they only had thirty packs and that seemed excessive  this is incredibly bland and flavorless but also overcarbonated and watery fine for easy pounding but not something worth looking out for

5521,Tank 7,4.38,tank 7  l 75 transparent burnt orange liquid  creamy tight light tan foam that turns spongy as it slowly settles 425  n apple produce dept yeastiness allspice clove cinnamon 400  t  apple skin touch of mango skin clove apple grappa heat or alcohol wood barrel a touch of light herbal thymol hops and maybe black pepper 45  f super fine effervescence slick and smooth medium body dry lightly alcoholic finish mild heat 45  o a fine beer and a style that i like if this is close to a top representation i appreciate no real barnyard and like the subtle flavor cues good tang to help the malt 45
5522,Tank 7,4.04,smells hoppy and is overall has a brighter fruitier hop profile compared to the hop profile of something like saison dupont its an american take on hoppy saison and i didnt really like it that much compared with something like saison dupont normally the citrusy or fruity flavors in a saison come from the yeast but here the hops shine brighter than the yeast also the taste and finish are sweeter than i like despite the generous amounts of hops its a great beer but a little too sweet and with a weird choice of hops for my personal taste maybe if you like american style ipas and saisons but you like ipas more you would like this
5523,Tank 7,4.24,aroma of vaguely sweet aromatics carbonated satisfyingly spicy mouthfeel taste of sweet florals honey fruits and a citrusy body just as described
5524,Tank 7,4.05,hazy high bitterness but still clean and bright classic beer flavor reminded me of a more european style
5525,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.98,355 ml can part of sleemans mixed 6 served cold into a pint glass  appearance  pale golden straw colored beer good expressive carbonation and a finger plus of head that has some staying power  smell  quite a bit of grainy notes and some cooked veggies not unpleasant and more aromatic than expected but doesnt inspire confidence either  taste  strangely flavored nothing off but theres not really any grain very watery not unpleasant but not great either  mouthfeel  clean and somewhat crisp carbonation is pretty intense yet theres a sensation of this going down so so easily  overall  better than i thought itd be but not great gassy but goes down surprisingly easy
5526,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,3.5,medium capped pils glass opacity bright with a faint mist of minerals color almost golden with low activity head slightly foamy 12 finger legs decent okay swirl reaction smell cabbageminerals taste barleyfloral feel cerealnoble hops body medium slick carbonation prickly overall feels like a german pils does the job well not much adjuncts pretty good quality probably the best one they brew  visual 610  flavors 610  sensations 610  balance 710  freshness 810  intensity 510  complexity 610  appreciation 6510
5527,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.48,regardless of the name on the label virtually all of sleemans core brands look the same silver creek lager is no different light yellow in colour with an antiseptically clean complexion and bubbles so plentiful yet entirely ineffective that they must be artificial they cant sustain a proper head  theres a certain characteristic that from day one ive noted in all sleeman products its especially prominent in the aroma its been many years since ive last had an offering of theirs but i still feel confident i could pick them out in a lineup with other massproduced domestic brand lagers  now i realize it must be the brand of corn syrup they use this sweet stenchy skunky note has an industrial ring to it a synthetic flavour that is markedly different from the wholesome toasty graininess of actual malted barley this taste is more like canned corn kernels and is unpleasant even offputting  the one thing i hear in defense of large commercial breweries is that theyre consistent like mcdonalds their beer taste the same everywhere you always know what youre getting to replicate a fermented product like beer to the same standards time and time again on a massive scale isnt easy this is true  but who wants to make shitty beer and who wants to drink shitty beer i tasted my first silver creek lager over a decade ago and it was just as insipid then as it is now thats an impressive feat but not one i think worthy of commending consistency is a good attribute  quality is a better one  the folks at sleeman arent dummies theyve left this recipe the same for good reason it sells this lager may be an injustice to the czech and german ones that originally inspired it but sorry to say its bland sweet lightbodied and firmly carbonated qualities are exactly what most consumers look for
5528,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.68,a golden light active carbonation white head s apple skunk corn mild t apple mild bread corny mild sweetness pleasant bitterness f crisp and bright but just slightly over carbonated o inoffensive but unremarkable i wouldnt avoid it but i wouldnt seek it out either
5529,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.56,a  pale straw colour good deal of carbonation head fades quickly with no real lacing  s  a slight skunky smell at the beginning with an apple scent as well almost has a ciderlike sweet smell but not in an appealing sense when im about to drink a lager  t  more of the apple like smell but the taste is fortunately not as sweet slightly bitter aftertaste though no real hop presence a bit of a musty taste at the very end as well  f  carbonation is appropriate for the style fairly crisp and refreshing  o  overall slightly unimpressed with this one not that i had overly high expectations i think i can say this is my least favourite sleeman product and im not typically a big fan of the company either i havent had the light or the original draught in a while but from what i remember i enjoyed them both slightly more however it is still a serviceable lager that could be consumed in large amounts and the unappealing factors would likely diminish after the first 2 or 3
5530,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.5,flashback 309
5531,Special Double Cream Stout,3.95,this was the first beer from bells and one of the first craft beers i ever tried
5532,Special Double Cream Stout,3.54,pours dark brown with a very nice one finger head aroma is nice roasted malt there is a degree of sweetness to the aroma as well taste is on the lighter side of moderate sweet with roasted malt though not as much as hinted at by the aroma the brew is smooth and creamy the abv is nearly absent a bit on the watery side for my personal taste but drinkable
5533,Special Double Cream Stout,4.09,poured stout black and much to my surprise had virtually no head but left offwhite lacing the aroma was mild for my nose but thats normal i did get that lactose sweetened malt and smooth coffee the taste features malts galore cocoa and chocolate and coffee and toast and the expected sweetness was present just not as a major player the feel was a bit thin for a stout especially a double but as the abv makes it possible to drink more than one without falling over the thinness works in its favor glad its local i get some every year just never rated it before
5534,Special Double Cream Stout,4.16,very tasty but light for a stout
5535,Special Double Cream Stout,4.23,on first taste smoothness is more prominent than taste not too sweet has a well balanced stout flavor
5536,Special Double Cream Stout,3.87,12 oz bottle glass nonic pint temp at pour 47 f abv 61   look very dark browntoblack with some chestnut highlights when held up to a light 1finger dark tanlight brown head that quickly dissipates to a thing cover and then that begins to disappear i suspect that the age of this bottle is a factor here  smell sweet roasted oats and rich semisweet chocolate touch of coffee here and there  taste initial molasses sweetness is quickly joined by roasted oats and some char the semisweet chocolate appears and transitions to bittersweet chocolate and obvious coffee notes emerge anise shows up near the end finishes on a sweet fading chocolate and molasses note  feel smooth and creamy body is in the heavier side of medium  overall this stout is a perennial favorite of mine i pick up at least a 6 pack each year if i can the coffee and chocolate notes remind of coffee stouts but are much less in your face the heavier body is nice somehow this particular bottle hid in the cellar for 2 years it didnt last long after i found it
5537,Special Double Cream Stout,4.29,l  black with mahogany highlights and a creamy tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind some lacing s  notes of semi sweet chocolate roasted dark malts coffee  smell is somewhat faint t  follows the nose with semi sweet chocolate and roasted dark malts intermixed with sweet cream and coffee along with a somewhat nutty finish f  medium bodied with light to medium carbonation smooth and velvety but a little thin on the finish o  a nice milk stout that doesnt really do anything wrong
5538,Special Double Cream Stout,3.62,poured gently from a bottle into a snifter glass forming maybe a finger of tan head deep cola brown color smell is sweetroasty oats taste is similar to the taste just mostly roasty with some sweetness taste got a bit much after it warmed wasnt a fan at all at that point medium bodied with moderate carbonation a fine milk stout if you like the roasty nature
5539,Special Double Cream Stout,5,its a very good strong and sweet stout with the heavier body and roasty characteristics youd expect from a stout magnified with the extra maltiness and higher abv of a double stout the hop malt roast and sweet flavors are well balanced and overall its just all around an excellent beer  on the newer brown label the words double cream are larger than the rest of the name so the two of us read that as doubly sweet stout rather than sweet double stout which is what it actually is  a maltier stronger version of a sweet stout its still a cream stout so of course it is sweet but its not dessert levels of sweetness which is good in my opinion  in other words a cream stout is a sweet stout and a double stout is a stronger maltier stout so this double cream stout is both of those put together it makes sense in hindsight   ive liked pretty much every beer ive tried from bells although theyre the most expensive 6packs you can buy around here at least when other craft beers were 10 for a 6pack bells 6packs were 17 so i normally never buy them
5540,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.33,2006 vintage  pours clear mahogany with crimson edging lively carbonation but a rather short lived head and zero lacing dark fruit and red wine in the nose medium bodied with a slickish oily mouthfeel dried plums dark cherries red apples on the palate finishes nicely tart with an acidity perfect for the depth of character
5541,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4,2007 vintage drank 3323  owen  engine  opaque purplered appearance  no head no lace  balsamic vinegar vanilla  red cherry notes in the nose  medium mouthfeel  balsamic vinegar  vanilla flavors tart red cherry notes on the finish  odd but somehow pretty good love to try one fresh sometime
5542,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.2,375ml bottle into a tulip 2015 vintage 7 years old  dark reddish plum body with no head until the last pour which turns the body muddy brown  light tart aroma  this one comes under the heading dont judge a book by its cover the look and faint aroma didnt promise much but the taste certainly delivered strongly sour and tart lots of dark skinned fruit sweetness buzzes in and out abv invisible could not believe its an 110  mouth closer to medium than full finish a fruit laden drying sourness  overall excelled flanders red sorry i went with the smaller bottle
5543,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.25,2019 bottle poured at fridge temp but allowed to warm for a while serving temp is 61 to 64 f pours a dark orangelight brown with zero head the nose is intense and insanely good tons of sour and funk tart sour cherries peaches red wine lemon floral and rhubarb  the taste is really interesting the lack of carbonation really makes it punch hard tart cherries lemon peel funk sour oak red wine and a slight nutty flavor really nice the alcohol is high but not detectable in any way  mouthfeel is medium bodied  low carbonation and dry very enjoyable
5544,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.84,this is my favorite sour hands down the mouthfeel is reminiscent of champagne despite the slender head and the nose is yeasty with a note of oak but the flavor is where it truly excels reminding me of a very fine wine tinged with unripened mango its hard to do it justice with words i could drink st good dog all day if i could only get my hands on a regular supply
5545,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.25,one of my thanksgiving beers taste was excellent but the look and feel a bit off  poured into a tulip glass clear brown color with little head or lacing smell and taste of dry red wine oak and warm spice cinnamon tart cherries went well with the turkey
5546,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.23,l rich burgundy and starts off with a khaki head s whisky sour mash caramel and wild flowers t cherries tangy malt and molasses f good carbonation and mouthfeel  my main issue with this is that you call definitely tell this is an 11 beer its about as subtle as a smack to the face otherwise quite delicious
5547,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.5,tastes like a malted milk ball candy so yummy
5548,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.24,12 oz bottle into a dimple mug l pours black with a creamy 14 light tan head low carbonation good head retention light scattered patchy lacing s dark chocolate fudge dark roasted grains black bread distant raisins  dates t sweet dark chocolate toasted dark caramelized malts a hint of char background raisins dates  prunes a very mild and distant suggestion of mineral taste it is gently bitter in the finish which lingers a bit f smooth and lightly creamy mediumbodied feel with a lightly fluffy center and a gently dry mediumlength finish o aroma and taste are nearly identical it is a bit sweet and is dominated by chocolate pleasant drinking and lightly dry it is outstanding in its style
5549,Organic Chocolate Stout,3.84,lumpy twofinger head which settles to a film of bubbles plenty of wider streaks as the beer is consumed dark brown color with no light passing  the smell is of freshly opened semisweet chocolate nibs minor chalk  sweet cocoa flavor above average body creamy on the initial sip but a bit watery in the swallow odd the carbonation is a bit on the low side this stout has no burnt bitterness might be better described as a chocolate porter the semisweet chocolate is the flavor all the way through the moderate aftertaste candylike and a onetrick pony
5550,Organic Chocolate Stout,3.9,pours black with a vigorous head aroma is light chocolate malt taste is light in body creamy sweet and a light milk chocolate flavor abv is quite light altogether quite respectable
5551,Organic Chocolate Stout,4,pours black 1finger brown head that quickly moves to being a collar  aroma of malt chocolate burnt marshmallow fig  taste is very sweet marshmallow caramel brown sugar and fudge  mouthfeel is medium bodied and decently cleansing  overall nice drinkable sessionable worth a try
5552,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.37,from a bottle pours a nice black colour with a thin head that sits nicely smell is faintly alcohol taste is amazing chocolate malt is predominant with a very slightly bitter finish
5553,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.77,16 oz can moderately chilled color is burnt umber with a tan head the feel is thin but silky smooth the cocoa is prominent without coming across as sweet allowing the malt roast to come through very wellbalanced and one of the most perfect beers ive ever had
5554,Organic Chocolate Stout,5,this is a 5star stout  the aroma doesnt knock you over with hops or alcohol the flavor is complete and doesnt become overwhelming or loose its punch as the glass is drained it has a good ritch mouthfeel that is not biting and is more smooth than chewy though it is definitely a stout you can chew  it pairs well with artisan pizza chicken alfredo grilled chicken and it stands alone very well on a cool night under the stars or by the campfire  it is a filetminoin or dessert stout something to savor not a quaffable daily driver
5555,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.5,pours dark tan foam chocolate aroma rich milk chocolate body sweet but not too sweet creamy smooth light bitter finish delicious
5556,Imperial Russian Stout,4.66,beautiful beer taste smell
5557,Imperial Russian Stout,3.21,i thought this beer was nasty but damn it sure is beautiful in the glass syrupy boozy whiskey barrel or wine beautiful cut with a knife thick long lasting dark head
5558,Imperial Russian Stout,4.4,stone imperial russian stout pours a deep dark black with a 2 finger dark tan head perched above nicely carbonated and beautifully laced this beer is a visual treat for stout lovers as bold as the beer looks the nose is surprisingly muted but i do detect coffee chocolate and malt in equal measure which is reassuring the taste is bounces right back to the boldness of the look and is complex coffee chocolate and malt notes are there but hops push right in this is one of the hoppiest imperial russian stouts i have ever had and i find that amazingly appealing as you swallow a fully rounded sweet aftertaste arises bold like molasses this brews balancing act of coffee chocolate malt hops and molasses is artfully composed and unique each flavor stands out and taken as a whole this is a fascinating brew i have been wondering for a decade why everyone speaks lovingly of stone imperial russian stout and now that i have tried it i believe the rave reviews i have read are all fully justified what can i say i will be stocking up
5559,Imperial Russian Stout,4.31,a jet black pour produces a deep tan creamy head lacing is streams and spots with varying stickiness feel is pretty aggressively bitter fitting in with stones reputation but it has the effect of roughing up the nearly full body of the beer for me aromas open with chocolate and coffee emphasized in the dark malts with the piney hops starting to play in as the beer warms up bitterness is up front in the taste seeming at first coming from the hops but the roasted notes of coffee hiaghcacao dark choclate and even a little campfire ember combine and take over by midtaste carbonation level is nice keeping the dark malt richness from weighing down each sip too much
5560,Imperial Russian Stout,4.32,havent had this in a very long time found it on draft in dallas  poured into a snifter absolutely beautiful beer dark brown color with a gorgeous brown head and excellent curtain lacing smell and taste of dark chocolate and burnt rye toast licorice and dark berries bold bitter finish dry and old school very nice
5561,Imperial Russian Stout,3.53,can certainly fits promotional description and some of the recent reviews very dark black lots of head dry bitter chocolate and coffee taste one reviewer compared it to soy sauce which i can see apparently a top selection of this style which i dont seem to resonate to my ratings reflect my preferences would omit if i could i think i like sweeter stouts like oatmeal stout better and those with caramel notes or less bitterness
5562,Imperial Russian Stout,3.81,pours black with a little head the aroma is dark malts maybe some vanilla and hops the taste is citrus hops dark malts licorice some bitterness with a little bit of vanilla and a tad bit like soy sauce this is an ok stout but drinks somewhat like a strong black ipa and id just prefer having one of those over this now the espresso irs was something special but this is a one and doner and i did have a higher opinion when i had it a few years back but many good stouts later my palette has probably shifted as it has with other beers as well cheers
5563,Imperial Russian Stout,4.17,canned 102022 4 months ago  appearance pours a completely dark black color with a massive dark tan head srm of 2324 425  aroma strong aromas of dark chocolate cocoa some bitter coffee roast underneath somewhat dry  flavor strong and rich flavors of dark chocolate cocoa some vanilla dark fruit light espresso roast yeasty in the middle and ultimately finishes with lingering dark chocolate notes  feel mediumbodied strong carbonation somewhat clean on the palate surprisingly dry  compared to sierra nevada narwal 22023 pours similar with a larger head milder aromas more dark chocolate and roast less pine more of a roasty bitterness with less pine  compared to north coast old rasputin 32023 pours similar darker head stronger aromas more dark chocolate and bitter pine less bittersweet chocolate english black malt and cream darker heavier and more bitter pine  overall a verywell made russian imperial stout dark chocolate coffee roast yeasty yet incredibly dry and drinkable the drinkability and dryness is the key here and how it hides the alcohol only this one and old raspy are the two that ive had that can do this this may be a close second to old raspy rating 417
5564,Imperial Russian Stout,3.93,never rated the original legend and i will not bore everyone with my history looks like stout aroma this is canned which kills aroma and i hate 99 of the time cans taste bitter chocolate black currant ill buy that if i knew what it was molasses slightly ive had better no coffee whatsoever hugely malted smooth satisfying but thin massive beer but i much prefer the old days 6 an bomber for this and at 19 a six pack no need to have again one and done the pathetic state of craft beer these days 
5565,Imperial Russian Stout,4,i do really enjoy this one its just plain good not really mindblowing but satisfying enough and good for the style idk why they removed the word russian from the name for this rerelease i mean i can assume why but its silly when you know the history of the style anyways i agree they shouldnt have taken this away i know theyre known as an ipa brewery but ive genuinely enjoyed their other beers as well
5566,Miller Genuine Draft,3.37,a faintly gold clear body with minimal sparkles weakly builds a short white head of airy foam that dies fairly quickly  if ive had this before it was from an uncles stealth at as a preteen but even now i really cant be sure just how incrementally different this is from high life not having them side by side  its lightly bread softly effervescent semisweet and very mildly herbally tangy the nose is a faint touch toastier and also a little white grapey
5567,Miller Genuine Draft,2.29,its a pretty standard american lager theres not a lot to set it apart from anything else out there getting it on tap in milwaukee is really the only way to drink it after having that drinking it out of the bottle anywhere else just tastes off
5568,Miller Genuine Draft,4.83,this is a good smooth tasting traditional lager for a backyard bbq or sitting by the pool on a hot summer day if youre looking for something crafty then look elsewhere but if you looking for a good lager at a decent price then mgd is the beer you want ive been drinking it since the 80s and i havent found a mass produced beer thats better
5569,Miller Genuine Draft,2.68,look clear golden yellow with 15 fingers of white head that dissipates quickly smell subtle hints of wheat not much aroma taste clean lager flavor with hints of corn feel lightbodied with moderate carbonation overall drinkable but nothing special this is a passable beer if you are a college kid with a very limited budget
5570,Miller Genuine Draft,5,for the category that its in it is excellent for those who compare it to a craft beer discount their opinions craft beer has gone way too far in the hazy category enough this is a nice return to traditional american brewing since world war ii it is affordable and delicious many craft beers have gotten way too pricey and not worth it the beer knower
5571,Miller Genuine Draft,1.29,pretty sure i wont like thisbut hey i really want to reach 400 reviews on beer advocate so lets give it a go  contains corn syrup as its american this is probably genetically modified oh well i had a shit day and really need a beer so fu ck it oh but its brewed in the czech republic so hopefully not who knows  quite a pale colourlight head aroma is unexciting and pale like the appearance not that pale is an aroma but it still describes it perfectly slightly ricey and corney  taste is kind of ok in terms of the hops its kind of sweet with the corn syrup prominent a little bit of a soggy cornflake taste hops are quite interesting and different from most german czech polish romanian dutch mexican and belgian pilsners but for me there is much too much corny sweetness i wouldnt want to drink a lot of these even though it is easy drinking its not crisp enough or dry enough to work as a refreshing or session beer in my opinion with a bit less corn syrup and more hops and more alcohol it could be ok  feel is watery with a little complexity in the hops and corn syrup  definitely not greati prefer a budget lidl or aldi pilsner over this and im definitely not a fan of the corn syrup better than some but not something i would ever buy or order again unless there was no other choice  
5572,Miller Genuine Draft,4.48,some of you guys need to chill a bit this isnt 2013 anymore its just beer a pretty decent one at that ive been there and back again in the craft beer world over the years hell i almost started up my own farmhouse brewery the only thing that stopped me was risk aversion and a total lack of business sense or knowhow as far as how to raise capital  this is a beer that reminds you of old times of dad and grandpa letting you take a sip of beer as a kid back in the late 80searly 90s you cant get those kinds of moments back but you can remind yourself of them through food and drink everyone dies someday but corporations are forever  is it a mass produced product of a giant corporation hellbent on dominating the market and crushing craft beer at all costs yes  but is it damn good too yes  bread water salt yeast and light hops  classic and filling
5573,World Wide Stout,4.57,1000th ba review  12 ounce bottle purchased in redding ca at a bevmo in august 2017 6 ounce pour pours a rich black colour with scant brown head that emerges briefly with swirling aroma awakens as warms  bready malt caramel fudge there is a note of raisin brown sugar but also a bit of char and some wafting booziness taste is a bittersweet blend of cocoa toffee brown sugar a hint of coffee raisin and bready malt with an earthy hop bite the sweetness is accented by the distinct booziness that manages to not be overpowering but this is a sipper full rich mouthfeel  sweet but never cloying  leaving with that warming boozy after burn
5574,World Wide Stout,4.85,a pours a very bark black color the head on top is a deep brown by the looks of it you know its going to be strong  s the smell of this beer consists of both bourbon and coffee the aroma lets you know that the taste will be rich  t very rich in flavor you can taste chocolate coffee plum and bourbon the beer is very rich an wonderful with its taste  mf this is a heavy full bodied beer  o excellent imperial stout i toughly enjoyed this one
5575,World Wide Stout,4.25,pours dark as night tan foam earthy aroma big sweet roasted malt body cocoa and coffee very heavy alcohol not as prominent as you would think bitter finish a very good imperial stout
5576,World Wide Stout,4.41,poured from a bottle with date of 110709 purchased from the rehoboth beach location a few years back by a friend  pours a thick black smells like its been barreled aged tastes like a vintage sherry decadently sweet but not in an off putting way drinks like liquid figgy pudding
5577,World Wide Stout,4.5,i tried a 10oz glass of this beer off the tapper at dry ground brewing as a guest tap in paducah kentucky it poured an opaque dark with thin tan head that did not leave much lace the scent had subtle common russian stout notes the taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip there was dark chocolate roast malt and subtle bitter hop presence the mouthfeel was fuller in body with good carbonation overall it is a solid beer
5578,World Wide Stout,3.95,2016 vintage from the bottle it pours a deep dark brownblack color with a tiny head that soon dissipates the nose gets burnt malts and alcohol the mouth gets a smooth creamy black malt flavored brew a real sippin brew 2019 vintage enjoyed in 2023  still yummy after all these years
5579,World Wide Stout,4,super high alcohol content it tastes good but it doesnt really taste great because it is like drinking toasty booze fun to try once but not really worth having more thn once or twice a year due to the super high price
5580,World Wide Stout,4,dark brown with a ruby hue and two fat fingers of airy mochacolored head rocky dissipation fairly quickly settles into wisp and crown  big aroma of chocolate cherry cordials and finger nail polish strong umami and shoe leather behind  plenty of umami and leather in the taste a good kiss of chocolate and plum too a bit of root beer decent alcohol heat relatively dry finish  slick oily feel light carbonation  tasty and complex 11116 bottling

5582,Maharaja,4.51,purchased as single at pilgrims market in cda id  canned may 1023 100 abv pours a chill hazed golden apricot bronze with two fingers of creamy off whitetawny tinged head nose is a burst of hops  citrusorange piney resin some tropical fruit and even a bit of peach there is a tiny bit of a soapy floral aroma and notes of caramel malt taste is initially sweet citrus mango again some peach with caramel malt resinous pine a herbal dank and sticky bitterness slowly builds there is almost a touch of vanilla orange creamsicle sweetness full and sticky bittersweet mouthfeel with a pleasant alcoholic warmth
5583,Maharaja,4.09,excellent imperial very heavily hopped crisp and drinkable despite the higher abv the hops bites like a snake as you sip it but it quickly fades away and is replaced by a mild sweetness theres nothing overly complex going on here no exotic notes to speak of its a fairly basic imperial ipa in composition but man is it done well will be buying this again and would probably put it in my top 5 list for imperials  a borderline worldclass imperial ipa in my opinion its good give it a try im always impressed with avery beers whether it be an ipa a stout or whatever else
5584,Maharaja,4.27,l beautiful golden orange that you can barely see through billowy white head that is slowly dissipating i wouldnt say turbid but lots of small floaties  s piney and rosin with some citrus zest  t sweet with a boozy bite slight bitterness that lingers on the tongue orange citrus notes  f slick with a little chewiness lightly carbonated but still bright  o very enjoyable for a 10 ipa i wasnt expecting it drinking this clean
5585,Maharaja,4.36,1272023 brew date very drinkable double ipa many dipas at 9 or above start to taste funny like too much sugar residue or just bland or unbalanced in some way this one tastes very solid a bit piney hoppy bitter like an ipa should taste i say this is well done and ive had most dipas out there worth the 3 a can at 10 abv
5586,Maharaja,4.39,from a can produced 12723 amber color with an inch of foamy tan colored head piney hop smell full bodied big caramel malt flavor followed by dank piney hops this thing packs a punch

5588,Maharaja,4.22,i used to drink this one back in 201415 in bombers when i could get it i recently picked up some cans and although i enjoyed it did not have the same reaction to what i remembered in the past the nose on it is what really convinced me something was different i used to be blown away by just how big and fruity the smell on it was but the cans were muted in comparison still a great beer
5589,Maharaja,4.1,this is some good stuff  even though i broke one of my rules  picked this one up less than fresh package 12722 consumed 7122  happy 4th still good  my rating reflects past fresher versions l from the can  stylish s sweet pine t lots of hoppy notes crashing through piney bitterness boozy f rich and smooth o its a winner  belongs in your rotation if you like this style
5590,Maharaja,4.1,pours a rich dark gold with ample head smells fruity herbal and hoppy the taste is grapefruit orange lemon piney and pretty bitter on the back end but its a mostly good finish this is a dry hoppy strong dipa that is more than serviceable for the price cheers
5591,Maharaja,4.89,this is an amazing beer i have no idea why the named it after the official beer from india the indian made beer is like a nice coors lite this is a mans beer fruity mango nice balance between 10 and sweet n bitter love it get it if you can
5592,Maharaja,3.66,ok this one is pretty its a orangeish copper barely translucent with a white head that settles into a nice cap and leaves lacing all over the walls of the glass it smells very sweet with caramel bites and a touch of piney mangoes but its not as fragrant as expected the alcohol is present on this one the gates is sweet and warming up front followed by a nice tropical fruit flavor that compliments the alcoholic sweetness nicely this one goes down too smoothly for a double digit abv beer i could drink 2 of these in a row without feeling like ive over done it which is rare with me and dipas if you see it on draft get yourself a pull but i dont see myself buying a four pack of this
5593,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.31,off the hard stuff running nothing like a guinness after a day made of work and running for health so well balanced like the extra stout from the bottle better than the draught these days though i like the pub draught atmosphere of course as much as the living room i dream of this beer on my runs and keep it to two a day in training a beauty
5594,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.18,from a 22oz bottle imported from ireland not brewed in baltimore bottle  l3036gd002  0008 into a guinness pint glass very drinkable with just enough body to balance the bitterness with a low creaminess so as not to be coating on the palate not my favorite style but when compared to the style requirements its almost as if they the style was written based on this beer regardless i cant rate it a five just yet 425  a  pours a clear but opaque black in the glass with red highlights with a threefinger frothy light tan head that slowly dissipates 45  s  dry and roasty nothing burnt sweet nor coffee some very minor dark chocolate 40  t  roasty malt but dominated by a dry almost burnt hoppy bitterness no sweetness or hop flavors 425  mf  medium light body with a dry almost astringent finish not creamy in my opinion but not a nitro pour 40
5595,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),2.53,much as it shames me being about 70 irish heritiage i simply cannot like this beer many do its just not for me
5596,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.79,pours opaque black with a thick light tan head good retention great lacing aroma is roasted malt and dark chocolate flavor follows the nose dark bread and roasted malt feel is smooth medium bodied with low carbonation overall a very nice irish stout
5597,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.85,aye tis be a fine day fer da post o stout ye shall recant a purvew o the generalities o blightys and irelands lovely brew  enough proofy prothy wonky and cobblygoobly talk here we go  the look onyx  the smell at times the scent of dark malted barley literally and coco nibs  taste when traveling the exhausting terrain of tralfamadore my senses were heightened ever since then every beer tastes precisely the same except a traditional stout a lovely biscuit dark chocolate and roasty veggies would pair well the brew itself roasty and slightly bitter not the style  feel completely devoid of human interaction i found the comfort in the only beverage available to humans a toutshsawgoh the first sip of this threw me into a stupor my mouth felt a cozy forthy and welcoming presence to these parched lips  overall for every action there must always be an equal and opposite reaction so said the doctor gallifrey mustnt have any porters or stouts since this brew allows bipedal individuals to time travel just to taste it this traditional stout is a classic and can still manage to transmit alienlike messages to our inner selves just to show us it rocks
5598,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.5,has that chocolaty kind of metal tasting guinness flavor of the original just a bit thicker  style stout  tapcanbottle bottle  abv 56  rating 35
5599,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.67,have had before but first time reviewing  allowed to acclimate to room temperature for 15 minutes and poured into a tulip pint glass not a tulip glass  pours black ive read guinness is actually very dark red with beautiful dark amber mixing with red hints around the edges with a 3 finger khaki head with foam that remains like seafoam when the head dissipates  initial aroma is slightly metallic followed by light olive green hoppy and dark tan bitter smells smells almost as if it doesnt have much body  initial taste is bitter and a little sour followed by malty as well as slightly reminiscent of purple grape soda when this mixes with the bitterness its a little like grape medicine but not unpleasant at all more bitter in the aftertaste mixing with cocoa that lingers on the back of the tongue and the back of the roof of the mouth its dry throughout the entire tasting process as you would expect an irish dry stout to be as i get more than halfway through i notice a note of molasses as well as a general sweetness throughout in addition to the bitterness  mouthfeel is richer than average overall smooth it goes down very easily and i have zero complaints about it but unfortunately i struggle to find any ways to describe what the carbonation does in the mouth or how it sits on the tongue  will buy again at some point but were it not attached to the guinness name i dont know if i would and i find myself leaning towards not overall a solid beer
5600,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.24,its been a while since ive had this and it is much better than i remember nice depth of flavor and id say a superior beer to the draught or at least the draught in a can  im getting an aroma primarily of malt and chocolate sweetness which is what hits first on the taste as well it then progresses with a wave of roast and a balancing bitterness semidark chocolate and char that nicely offsets the sweetness on the finish and aftertaste there is a slight addition of dark fruit medium bodied and moderate carbonation
5601,Modelo Light,2.13,id like this one much more if it had somewhere around 4 abv  at 2 abv it just isnt worth drinking tastes like watered down corona light which means it tastes like water with extra water
5602,Modelo Light,1.9,appears very slightly yellow color with a foamy head that dropped quickly and no lacing smells very lightly bready corn lightly floral taste follows the nose mouth feel is very keen light for the style watery overall i dont like light beers but if you do you might like it i probably wouldnt order again
5603,Modelo Light,3.08,a lot like regular only thinner along with malts and a beery finish was expecting it to be very light but drinkable and that pretty much sums it up
5604,Modelo Light,2.12,straight from the bottle to wine glass very cold beer appearance light pale yellow minimal head a lot of lacing aroma scent smell of malt nothing else taste not really great mouth feel very carbonated overall good beer for the hot weather
5605,Modelo Light,1.63,watered down modelo especial less flavor less calories less adepts modelo made this in response to tecate light a very succesfull beer in mexico but its not even close in sales or fans
5606,Amigos,2.86,1115 fl oz bottle bbe feb 2013 im not scared found a single bottle of this on the floor at the local bottle shop got it for 99 cents cerveza especial product of the uk  not what youd expect to read on what appears to be a mexican style lager label lists a 600 abv  poured into a kentucky bourbon barrel ale mini snifter  a  pours a standard dark golden body the same as it appears through the clear glass bottle conjures hardly anything for a head merely a quarter inch of white froth that falls to a thin ring quickly appears aptly carbonated but has no real head some thin sticky scattered random lacing when given a nice swirl  s  aroma is where this one loses me its not typical of a lager or a malt liquor or a light beer for that matter has a bit of faint dusty bready malt sweetness with some vague notions of citrus fruit  citrus peel probably lime or lemon  t  taste is extremely sweet  syrupy with a hint of lemonlime tartness that is actually quite nice definitely over the top sweetness dominates this one with the citrus flavors coming in second its not awful but its certainly not complex stuff  m  feel is smooth  sweet easydrinking definitely doesnt feel like 600 abv needs better carbonation  overall this was probably an old as hell bottle so i will do my best to try this one again fresh until then well just call it interesting  amigos 35
5607,Amigos,1.93,330ml bottle from local express kings cross london this one was a really terrible beer by no means the worst ive tried but to be honest i wasnt expecting much else from it  it probably wasnt even quite as bad as i feared going in obviously itll not be one ill pick up again given it was far too sweet thin  offputting but i guess it could have been a lot worse
5608,Amigos,3.34,i expected this to be another subcorona clone but was pleasantly surprised by the citrus taste and the overall drinkability
5609,Amigos,1.55,refreshing but dull too overwhelming citrus flavour ruins this beer
5610,Amigos,2.49,poured from a clear bottle into a dogfish head pint glass pours a medium golden amber with a thin white head that dissipates to light patchiness no lacing aroma is immediately noticeable on opening the bottle and pouring a strong fruity and agave tequila citrus smell malt is subdued flavor is watery tequila lime sprite citrus sweet light bodied apparently an import to compete with the light fruit beers and drinks this does not taste much like beer a faint hint of malt but really tastes almost exactly like a left over tequila and sprite drink from last night with melted ice cubes not familiar with this style but its not for me
5611,Amigos,2.52,a 500ml clear glass bottle with a bb of sept 2014 acquired a while back from a supermarket described as a tequila flavoured beer allegedly created in honour of the aztec god huehuecoyotl inspiring  poured into a straight pint glass a clear golden colour with good carbonation forms a smallish head of white foam that lasts for a moment before dissipating aroma of sweet artificial fruits and sugar with vague hints of lime weak malt and a whisper of stewed leaves decidedly subpar  tastes like an artificial fruit cocktail with a sweet finish notes of lime juicyfruits sugarsweetener faint malt weak stewed leaves and a harsh quality in the background little bitterness to speak of but a touch of acrid cardboard upon swallowing mouthfeel is smooth and tingly with prickly carbonation and a thin watery body mildly astringent followed by an aftertaste of lime cocktail sweetener and harsh stewed leaves  blech  not much of a beer looks pretty normal however the aroma and flavour possess a cloying sweetness and fake fruit notes that jar the senses insipid body a fairly unpleasant experience at least for anyone with functioning tastebuds one to avoid
5612,Amigos,1.69,found this bottle in manhattan ks i thought it was a typical mexican lager but closer inspection revealed it to be from the uk further inspection of the ingredients led me to the discovery that they put sugar flavor and citric acid in it all of those ingredients make it taste like a corona that has already had a lime added to it or possible like a miller chill its fizzy and works okay with tacos but it was just not my thing

5617,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.31,poured from a twelve ounce bottle the body is a deep brown or black one finger of a light tan head and good lacing  aroma is the barrel vanilla chocolate and dark fruit a bit of cherries  taste follows nose with an assertive bourbon flavor and some oak chocolate dark fruit and malty char at the end of swallow a light bitterness appears as the stout warms everything softens wonderful  creamy mouthfeel with good carbonation not the thickest stout feel but flavor more than makes up for it  a top notch barrel aged stout

5621,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.09,appearance pours a very dark brown body with a mediumsmallsized light khakicolored head  smell a sliver of char with woodsy bourbonmoist barrel tones leading to bittersweet chocolate morsels smooth roast and brown sugar with a slight fruitiness of blueberry blackberry  taste sweetish chocolaty with plenty of warming oaken spiced woodsy bourbon tones a bit charry and ashen more brown sugar and again the softly tangy fruitiness but its fairly wellintegrated as in its not gankylevel sweet or housing a jolt of fruitiness final zip of fruitiness sweetness and heat though it wraps up reasonably dry for a big stout  mouthfeel mediumplus body mediumlight carbonation just a bit chewy though far from being gummy or gloopy  overall it houses a sound richness yet the beer is surprisingly wellattenuated tasty and tight in its overall execution

5624,Dead Guy Ale,3.79,pours a cloudy honey amber color with a decent head which dissipates quickly with almost no lacing aroma is malt and yeast taste is nice definitely malt with some nice bitterness and spicy follow up feel is honey with some carbonation and sharpness very nice one of the few maibocks ive had
5625,Dead Guy Ale,3.72,great maibock mild flavor but well balanced id describe it as a malty light ipa  gorgeous color
5626,Dead Guy Ale,3.4,pours a clear amber brief 05 head that rather quickly fizzles to a thin ring no lacing nose smells sweet of caramel honey and yeast esters as it warms starts to resemble golden syrup with a little warming spice taste is very honey forward  reminds me most of those honey straws you bite the ends of and chew down spicy barley notes as well which give it some more savory notes that help prevent this from becoming too sweet light bitterness comes through long on the finish something about it reminds me of less sweet more hopforward and spicy barleywines mouthfeel is on the light side with crisp and slightly creamy carbonation
5627,Dead Guy Ale,3.5,i drank it from a can poured into a goblet color is light amber there is almost no smell malt dominates the taste as expected in a maibock the sweetness is appropriately balanced with hops  although i would prefer more i would rate it higher but i prefer a lighter bodied beer overall  it is a a very good beer and is deserving of this rating
5628,Dead Guy Ale,4.28,delicious the flavors change as you drink it with a slightly bitter finish great beer overall
5629,Dead Guy Ale,3.35,from a 14 month old 16 oz can a cloudy shade of apricot with a cherry tint minimal head which quickly disappears no lacing taste is hard to quantify not much of anything stepping up feel is medium cloying zero carbonation overall i dont think this may be a fair evaluation due to its age and i got it off the shelf
5630,Dead Guy Ale,3.91,12 ounce bottle poured into a dimpled mug  l hazy medium amber 2 finger manila colored head foam is rocky and persistent s big malty bread aroma orange tea honey t malty and medium sweet to open biscuit orange herbal tea bitter woody and light orange hops take over the back half aftertaste is woody with some malt sweetness f medium body medium carbonation soft and fairly clean feel o decent love the malty opening but find the back half a bit sharp for my palate
5631,Abraxas,3.94,pours an opaque pitchblack coloration with a small fizzy head smells of roasted caramel malt and strong milk chocolate and cinnamon aromas with hints of vanilla coming through as well taste follows the nose with a poor balance of roasted caramel malt and strong chocolate and cinnamon notes with the cinnamon standing out particularly as well as some vanilla and just the merest hint of chilis finishes bittersweet with a medium sweetness light bitterness and some cinnamon and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste full mouthfeel with a mediumrich body and carbonation  ba abraxas has got to be the most overrated stout that i have ever tasted and perhaps unsurprisingly the same goes for the base version which suffers from exactly the same poor balance that i already disliked for the barrelaged version its basically a total cinnamon bomb the cinnamon being way too overdone here and pretty much drowning out everything else except the chocolate which only underlines the sweetness of the cinnamon theres hints of vanilla as well but next to no chili heat coming through which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness at least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet but i have had plenty of much better mexican imperial stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me i will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here rich and velvety while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms also the abv is very wellhidden this drinking surprisingly smooth and mellow this is by no means a bad beer just feels more like a pastry stout than a mexican stout to me
5632,Abraxas,4.53,2022 vintage cacao and a hint of chili on the nose taking a first sip the cacao really pops a light chili and cinnamon aftertaste follows the chili isnt spicy but its flavorful  this is a fantastic imperial stout at first i thought this might be a little too sweet but as i drink more its really not the sweetness does a great job of balancing out the bitterness of the bakers chocolate as well as the cinnamon and i can see why they did it i might have dialed it back just a hair but thats a nitpick  full bodied nice and thick like an imperial stout should be almost chewy as the beer gets warmer the cinnamon gets more noticeable  long after a sip vanilla takes center stage as it lingers on the tongue with the cacao chili and cinnamon still noticeable in the background wonderful  overall this is one of the very best imperial stouts ive had excellent job i will buy a few more of these and see how they age assuming i can keep them around for a few years without drinking them first
5633,Abraxas,4.54,truly an excellent beer  bought a bomber of this beer at the brewery this past march i decided to have it for fathers day  poured into a tulip glass rich oily dark brown color with a brown head and excellent curtain lacing needed to let it warm for the nose to open a bit smell of dark chocolate cinnamon vanilla and chili pepper follows to the taste initially the flavors of fresh stone fruit contributed this transitioned to stronger chocolate cinnamon vanilla the chili also becomes stronger as it warms apricot and cream seriously pleasant booze and malt background flavors are so nicely woven together luxuriant smooth feel i would love to try the barrel aged version sometime a great fathers day treat
5634,Abraxas,4.45,deep copper with a 12 tan head which slowly fades minimal lacing  aroma of cinnamon chocolate hot pepper vanilla caramelly as it warms  taste is cinnamon peppers chocolate roasty vanilla stronger on the nose than palate  full body light carbonation thick  oily finish  bottled 102317 as expected with a 5 year old high abv stout it has little head  minimal lacing apart from that this is a very good imp stout
5635,Abraxas,4.5,2021 115 abv
5636,Abraxas,4.66,l poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter  heavy black pour with very little dark foam risen to the surface s notes of chocolate coffee dark fruits vanilla cinnamon very on point with the description and its awesome because you can smell the chili in there as well t wow definitely getting the bakers milk chocolate upfront along with some vanilla cinnamon dark fruits chili peppers and malts this is so good f thick syrupy heavy bodied easy to drink the abv hides very well in this o i knew once i read chili it would be a hit or miss because sometimes with other beers you cant taste it as much but this hits it on point great job
5637,Abraxas,4.84,2021 vintage  poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter  look black opaque no visible particulate dark brown frothy head slightly below average lacing average head retention  smell cacao vanilla chili pepper slight ceylon cinnamon medium strength of scent  taste cacao vanilla chili pepper ceylon cinnamon moderately sweet mildly spicy high strength of flavor  feel medium body highly silky slightly below average carbonation highly mouth warming moderately mouth coating moderately sweet mildly spicy  overall black and opaque with average head retention bouquet was a fantastic mix of cacao vanilla chili pepper and ceylon cinnamon with medium strength taste was a high strength blend of cacao vanilla chili pepper and ceylon cinnamon that was truly delightful this beer had medium body with high silkiness and mouth warming properties overall this beer provided a fantastic experience and is one of the best stouts i have ever had
5638,Abraxas,3.66,2022 vintage  contains lactose   way too sweet and unbalanced with some off flavors
5639,Abraxas,4.5,poured into a tulip very modest head zero lacing very dark brown but not quite black essentially opaque not as viscous as some of the style  very pleasant and melded aromas chocolate coffee cinnamon vanilla and cashew  roasty but sweet malts on the tip of the tongue coffee and nuttyvanilla notes in midstream bitterness boosts here to the end the cinnamon gives way to the ancho warmth at the finish hides the booze well  mediumfull bodied but not quite chewy modest carbonation but not sticky or cloying  this brew and bomb are sixes and sevens for me and thats a high compliment this is a more restrained take with a bit less sweetness and heat and more nutty goodness
5640,Not Your Father's Root Beer (10.7%),3.05,bomber from winco dark brown with thick creamy head aroma is root beer some sassafras some vanilla taste takes a downturn alcohol burn up front licorice obscures the root beer aroma sweet medicinal earthy finishes the same started out nice and went downhill from there
5641,Not Your Father's Root Beer (10.7%),5,i love itsad you cant get the real stuff any more the pabst one cant compare to it
5642,Not Your Father's Root Beer (10.7%),3.91,definitely one of the best options available for those who love soda and want an alcoholic drink other than jack and coke ive rated this one unobjectively as an overall product to the target demographic
5643,Not Your Father's Root Beer (10.7%),3.24,mahogany brown in color with an fingernail of brown around the rim and covering half of the top the aroma is flat root beer with a slightly sweet boozy edge the taste is smoky root beer and black licorice theres plenty of booze and it isnt well hidden theres a bit of dry stickiness and theres definitely a boozy burn on the way down not sure what i was expecting but not sure what some of the others see in this my opinion of this beer increased greatly as it warmed
5644,Not Your Father's Root Beer (10.7%),4.79,this very unique and fragrant rootbeer pours a nice dark color with very little head  the nose is super complex and spicy with strong hints of vanilla cinnamon cloves anise cherries alcohol and earthy notes  the taste is also very complex and compliments the nose perfectly the complexity really comes out as the root beer gets a bit warmer this also leaves a pleasant warm glow in your stomach again the presence of strong hints of vanilla cinnamon cloves anise cherries alcohol are all there  the mouthfeel is slightly more watery than i expected but this could easily be attributed to the volume of alcohol  overall this is an exceptional root beer i highly recommend trying it as it is very pleasant to drink
5645,Not Your Father's Root Beer (10.7%),4.54,wow really surprised poured from a 25 oz bottle into a snifter the appearance is pitch black with a small tan head the aroma is root beer and alcohol the taste follows the nose the best hard root beer i have had
5646,Pale Ale,3.28,in a bind taste test i wouldnt guess this was a gluten free beer in fact my guess would be coors banquet with just a touch more hops like banquet its corn forward and slightly cloying but overall inoffensive
5647,Pale Ale,3.88,gluten free pales and ipas are a struggle these are not easy brews to make this is one of the best i have had as it would be an pretty good beer if you did not know it was gluten free overall i believe they did a very good job on this brew
5648,Pale Ale,2.34,crystal clear color of light gold brief onefinger head absolutely zero lacing on the glass  the smell is dry malt with a caramel touch theres a bit of cardboard to the nose as well  high carbonation level with not enough body to balance it despite this this beer is too sweet cloy even there are overtones of apricot and caramel but it isnt appealingtoo dessert like the hop is nearly nonexistent which is unfortunate since this beer needs balance think double bock without the body or rich malt presence a clear miss
5649,Pale Ale,1,if a 0 was possible i would have given it such this is easily one of the worst beers i have ever tasted i had to actually pour it down the sink and i think it worked better as a drain cleaner than a beer dont waste your money
5650,Pale Ale,1.24,awful tastes like plastic oh my god was this bad like pour it out bad i cant even cook with this stuff avoid at all costs
5651,Pale Ale,2.06,it looks nice but not a solid gf option
5652,Pale Ale,1.51,no thanks really strange i need more words but i cant
5653,Pale Ale,2.69,very carbonated nice gf substitute but there are much better options if you are not gluten intolerant
5654,Boxer Ice,3.96,was looking for a new beer to try i bought it without knowning its a canadian beer 1 pint for 3 cad thats sounds a good deal love the colour the foam really thick and rich taste good can not say the best lager beer i tasted but the fact its family owned and no preservatives made me love this beer
5655,Boxer Ice,1.02,i recently consumed a king can of boxer ice on my birthday from the first sip i knew their was something wrong despite the hiss of the can as i opened it their was a lack of carbonation it had the sweet taste of malted corn syrup and the aftertaste of the can it was in i question how something like this got past quality control as this is probably the most foul cheaply thrown together beers out there stomach cramps will induce after about half the can and your desire to drink afterwards will only be driven by your desire to wash your palate any beer tastes better after drinking this
5656,Boxer Ice,2.56,this beer is aggressively mediocre but for the price thats about all you could hope for it is a run of the mill light beer it does not taste like vanilla or cream soda like some of these other reviews are saying it starts with a slightly rotten wheaty flavor and finishes pretty smooth well smoother than you would expect i wouldnt recommend this beer but its drinkable if you lose a bet this is a good choice if you want to give the victor a revenge beer that is still drinkable
5657,Boxer Ice,2.27,drank from a 12 ounce can scores are based on the style  look  kinda cheap design befitting of the cheap price tag looks like the local softball teams jerseys you can definitely tell its an ice beer because of the ice cubes  smell  very light grains wafting in from a distant wind  taste  cream soda its weird mostly nothing but a slight vanilla flavor  feel  light body and strong tingly carbonation fairly typical  overall  eh mediocre slightly higher alcohol and 14 for 36 cans i guess its a fine party beer
5658,Boxer Ice,3.5,well i dont mind this beer myself of course my taste buds are shot but its heads and tails above boxer lager which is way too sweet and it has a good kick to it rarely pour it in a glass but when i have theres a decent head not to little not too much  plus im on a limited income and 1711 including tax is hard to beat for a 36 pack better than miller imo
5659,Boxer Ice,2.28,ok its cheap tastes like ice beerand goes down easy this is not a beer to think on i found it on sale for 899 for a 36 pack 25 a can at that price it is hard to beat
5660,Boxer Ice,3.36,710 ml can served in a pilsner glass  this beauty pours a brilliant golden color and is topped with several inches of eggshell head that leaves no lacing  the smell is light grain notes  it has mild malt flavor it is extremely clean with a dry finish  thin mouthfeel  at 95 a can how could i go wrong i would even pay 1 if it was 8 it is cheap and easy drinking great high school kid or college beer
5661,Boxer Ice,1.82,aroma and flavor is sweetish cornmalts an odd but expected off funk and tart finish not much in the way of flavor at all apart from the off funk
5662,Boxer Ice,2.07,served straight out of the freezer into a room temp weizen glass  pours an apricot golden blonde color 20 opaque tall 4 finger head eventually it eats away to 1 finger and then finally a creamy ring  aroma is wet cardboard herbs apple cores banana peel corn kernels it actually smells pretty fresh and clean with character  a deep malt and straw base starts it off but quickly fades to corn juicethen cotton candy to draw a picture  think of a buttered cob of corn dipped in powdered sugar some tin follows  its rather thick and juicy for an ice beer but still somewhat crushable medium bodied dare i say and a carbonated finish  for a dollar nine its really not terrible but i can afford better so obviously i wont be having this again i still say when and if im ever down on my luck miller high life will be my brown bag jam
5663,Boxer Ice,1,worst beer i have ever drank 
5664,Boxer Ice,4,surprisingly good for what people call a cheap beer in fact i think it could impress in the value department on how good a cheap beer can be category golden color light head good carbonation slight sweetness that gives it an almost oak beer taste  aroma i would put this above a lot of beers good value
5665,Boxer Ice,2.71,this beer is comfortably in the shcategory as evident by the fact that you can pick up a 36pack for less than 15 bucks with that said i do consider boxer ice to be on the shthrone as the ruler of cheap beers proudly looking over her kingdom of coors budweiser and pabst  very drinkable both hot or cold slightly metallic might be due to the can however the sweetness of the beer hides a lot of its flaws definitely not something ill buy to impress someone but for if you only have 15 and want drinkable quantity at the lowest possible price this is your best bet  much better than the regular boxer just a surprisingly nonshy beer  for being a sh beer that is
5666,Pannepot Reserva,4.35,bottled and received in the post but so long ago i cant remember from whom but either from someone at struise or a friend of somebody at struise pours a rich dark brown body with some good off white head aroma is toffee and christmas spice flavour is plums and a note of patchouli
5667,Pannepot Reserva,4.5,i think i like struise pannepot better over struise pannepot reserva
5668,Pannepot Reserva,4.07,330ml bottle 2018 label 06102020 dated 5 years poured into a stemless wine glass  the beer pours a deep burgundy color cola hues with a thin finger of khaki head loose bubbles that offer no retention nor lacing the aroma is nice deep rich stone fruits hearty grain brown bread clove fruity yeast caramel brown sugar vanilla oak raisin and licorice the flavors are good lots of stone fruits raisin licorice strong belgian yeast brown sugar caramel lots of brown bread soft oak anise and a bit of spice the mouthfeel is okay coating a bit thin a little more on the flat side than expected but with a hearty finish  verdict a nice quad from de struise the beer could use a bit of life in the body but flavor wise its all there delivering the type of complexity and depth that makes the quad such a captivating style
5669,Pannepot Reserva,4.53,2018 bourbon ba version
5670,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.46,9823 on tap at chilis in uniontown pa visited after our first lymes disease trial shot  not much in the nose considering the decent bready banana wheat spice notes  i consider this a nice decent average mass produced witbier
5671,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.73,24 oz can acclimated to 48f and poured into a tulip glass  pours hazy the color of apricot juice nice color produces a 1 finger white head dissipating quickly and leaving lacing that fades quickly  initial aroma is orange peel and juice with some yeast slight note of hay maybe after agitating im hit with a funky and cooling smell that reminds me of sea spray  initial taste before swallowing feels like it hits the same receptors as salt its juicy and yeasty with a peachy and apricot taste after swallowing i first taste a peachyfruitynectarjuicy taste i then notice a fermentedbreaddoughyeast taste that seems to grow in intensity when the other tastes fade in the aftertaste is a bitterness that i dont find pleasant sort of a rotten vegetable taste  mouthfeel is rather juicy feeling heavy and somewhat sticky but not syrupy dare i say silky its the proper descriptor but implies a little higher quality than id call it  overall its good for the price its not amazing and its not got many layers of flavor but it satisfied me well enough i did enjoy the yeasty bread taste quite a bit and the mouthfeel was impressive would be a decent session beer if kept at the recommended temperature and not allowed to warm too much  not likely to buy again ive had it in the past but wanted to try again maybe in several years like i did this time i might but whatever
5672,Blue Moon Belgian White,4.6,smells like faint over ripe bananas taste is a floral orange blossom with a pinch of coriander anise pumpkin seed and white flower amalgamation
5673,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.66,uk brewed version poured from a 330ml bottle this beer is very cloudy light orange  an inch thick tightly bubbled head forms bit is short lived and leaves no lacing  highly carbonated looking the smell is of yeast fruit and light malt and the taste follows this with the addition of the classic  for this style  addition of orange and coriander its slightly sweet and bitter in a nicely rounded way and has a nice mildly dry finish  very fizzy with a good viscosity overall pleasantly surprised the flavour is rounded if a little too mellow but its overall tasty and refreshing not as good as hoegaarden used to be better than the glucose syrup laden stuff it is now 
5674,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.48,probably the best mass produced beer very easy to drink and decent abv
5675,Blue Moon Belgian White,1.22,terrible ill tell you why it tastes like sun tan lotion literally banana boat sunscreen
5676,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.66,500 ml can from bilkatogo denmark abv is 54 hazy yellow colour large white head wheaty aroma hints of coriander and orange peel smooth mouthfeel citric and wheaty flavour a hint of coriander low bitterness refreshing

5678,Celebrator,4.94,my first doppelbock when i read what a doppelbock was i knew i would love it this beer is soo good malt malt malt extraordinary will be in my permanent rotation
5679,Celebrator,4.44,excellent doppelbock dark color dark translucent light barely shines through at all still clear feel is ok but it tastes great easy toasty but not smokey smell is nice but too subtle
5680,Celebrator,5,one of the finest beers on the market the look is similar to a brown ale lots of malt  chocolate and toffee on the nose the nose definitely transfers to the palate its not overly heavy a very nice balance of dark and rich maltiness the 67 abv gives it enough punch to compliment the flavor profile o e of my most recommended beers
5681,Celebrator,3.27,very deep amber nearly black malty spicy smell taste is the same very fizzy in mouth not bad but not that interesting
5682,Celebrator,4.1,330 ml bottle poured cold into a pint glass deep brown with a good dense tan foam aroma is bready malt  reminds me of spent brewery malt really and yes pumpernickel taste follows tasty malt forward with coffee in the middle the coffee lingers finishes lightly sweet slightly dry overall i think i got a reasonably fresh bottle to grade ive had many that were tinny this is a fine beer
5683,Celebrator,4.93,112 oz bottle stamped l2224 into a 12 oz tulip glass l pours black with a 2 rounded light tan creamy head that has excellent retention with a light cap good steady fine carbo bubbles spotty random lacing and some light sheeting s highly caramelized malts toasted grains dark chocolate a hint of minerality background dark fruits t moderately complex masterfully balanced chocolate caramelized malts dark fruit notes of fig dates plum red grape char darkly roasted grains raisins dark brown bread crust and a tender mineral taste it is very gently bitter f creamy mediumheavy body with a mediumlength fairly smooth standard finish o one of the most agreeable beers ive ever tasted gorgeous fantastic balance encapsulated in chocolate lightly sweet bitter toasty malts smooth finish incredibly pleasing tastes rated 1 because it deserves it one of the finest beers in the world it is worldclass
5684,Celebrator,2.94,had high expectations but it was just okay
5685,Celebrator,3.97,330 ml bottle poured into a tulip  clear and saddle brown with ruby hues and a two finger manila colored head the foam is persistent fairly dense and leaves a little lace a lively glass of beer  the nose is malty with bread caramel and dried fruit aromas over lesser milky lactose and mineral notes less malty and sweet than expected the taste is overall sharp with a woody hop finish there is caramel and chocolate malt flavor but bread isnt coming through carbonation is mediumhigh but the mediumweight body is soft and creamy  fist time trying this and as stated it is more sharp and less malt forward than i expected my bottle is just over a year old and i am curious if a fresher bottle is that much different
5686,Funeral Bock,4.2,canned 1021  just in time for halloween very dark brown nice nose of coffee and chocolate taste is highly layered with an upfront bitterness followed closely with an unmistakable dose of roasted grain more expresso coffee and maybe a bit of licorice exceptionally smooth and clean this lager has close to mystic qualities the 7 abv is enough to give a warmness with no alcohol bite  highly recommended this is great stuff
5687,Funeral Bock,4.18,poured from a can at fridge temp pours blackvery dark brown with a good amount of tan head the nose is full of chocolate burnt toast dark malts and some oaky bitterness an earthy note is there as well  the taste is excellent here im getting some burnt toffee dark chocolate oak some charred wood slight coffee grounds and some big bready malts maybe a touch of dark fruit but thats definitely not a big player the aftertaste is mostly a woody bitterness  the mouthfeel is dry and medium bodied overall this is an excellent beer
5688,Funeral Bock,3.68,dark brown pour head settles go a thin cap of light brown  aroma is burnt toast dark fruits molasses and a grain note as it warms  tastes is chocolate toast dark fruit and a roast note and a little smokey vibe in the aftertaste  medium body but very full feel to it fairly carbonated clean dry finish just the ever slightest hint of abv in the throatnasal cavity
5689,Funeral Bock,4.06,excellent dark brown body smells of chocolate and toasted biscuit slight burnt malt floral and citrus bitterness on the backend like a chocolate marmalade medium body good carbonation yummy
5690,Funeral Bock,4.17,handsome dark russet amber brew with finegrained foam in the blanche de chambly goblet quite sweet with a winter ale sort of taste but seems to be all dark malts and no spice fruit cake with some burnt sugar and a dark coffee aftertaste toffee notes with a nutty finish  here is actually an unusual beer i would gladly drink more of the combination of the dark flavors with the sweet bock taste is quite appealing more for sipping than quaffing from the 16 oz can purchased at new seasons dated 102521 intriguing black cat label
5691,Funeral Bock,3.93,16oz can from tavour near black pour ring of head light roast malt aroma taste is mildly sweet nutty with a light roasty bitterness super smooth
5692,Funeral Bock,4.13,16oz can with a canned on date of 100520 bordering on dopplebock territory with this abv very dark brown color with a finger of head aroma of cocoa roasted malt bread and earth much the same in the flavor surprising amount of roast and that gives some bitterness so this beer does not get too sweet good body and appropriately carbonated
5693,Ephraim,4.25,pickedup two fourpacks of cans at hill farmstead brewery in greensboro bend vermont for about twenty two dollars my twenty first brew from these guys good but a bit overrated for me
5694,Ephraim,4.43,look  nice hazy tannish orange with a ncie white head rimming and lacing smell  more faint than i would guess mostly citrus slight floral dank taste  dank resin citrus with a slight caramel malt backbone feel  full body with a lighter carb slight creamy overall  almost like a cross between a west coast and an east coast
5695,Ephraim,4.5,while boneyard notorious is still my favorite traditional  west coast stylized triple ipa this is quite enjoyable  dank a touch fruity big in hoppy bite and some ethanol yet still pretty smooth dig
5696,Ephraim,4.5,12oz can from hf hazy golden pour fine white foamy head piney hoppy aroma citrus peel taste is oranges citrus peel light caramel malts very smooth juicy lingering bitter finish sublime
5697,Ephraim,4.25,canned on 52522 consumed on 61422  pours a hazy largely translucent dark orange body topped with two fingers of fluffy slightly offwhite foam good head retention leaves a halffinger of cap a slim frothy collar and myriad spattering of webbyspotty lacing strewn across the walls of the glass  aroma highlights dank orange oils and accents of sunflower petalsgeneral florality upfront leaving crackery malt lingering into soft grassy resins glossing over soft lemon peel over time  taste features waxy peach zest within a resinous overlay as grapefruit steadily washes over a cattypeppery undertone light moss and wilted mint over the midpalate fade to residual pine past the finish  mouthfeel brings a medium body and a choppy fluff of moderate carbonation dispersing dry textures and a pseudobittering over the midpalate before eventually fading to a flaky crispness a resinous glide brightens over the back end as bits of residual grit prickle the finish  a warming aggression peeks through the stability of crackery malt and floral resins an unforeseen grit waving across the normally clean hill ipa profile the subtle bittering and choppier tones of earth the result ultimately lend to a slightly more varied and intense profile to contrast the largely delicate base
5698,Adios Ghost,4.44,opaque tanyellow with a short bubbly head of offwhite hue  just after drinking a hohum ipa this exploded as super verdant dank herbal cannabic tropical spicy and everything else in between without anything offensive

5706,Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4,this one was pretty good seemed to lean more heavily into the fruity ester notes along with a nice malty backbone and some belgian spiciness enjoyable to drink
5707,Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.24,well what an nice belgium tripel one of my new favorite tripels cloudy fruity hints of apricos bananas and citrus soft bitterness well hidden alcohol

5709,Alpha King,4.4,from my review in nbw 138  hello all lets get this new beer weekend started shall we  this one is three floyds alpha king sent to me by the inestimable turkeysdrinkbeer many moons ago and one that has been begging me to drink it for some time now  so onto the review     this beer has sat in my fridge for six months it came to me pride beating in simmering waves from its aluminium chest across the continental usa leaping the pacific ocean and docking prouder than john holmes in a ruler factory at the back of my fridge  since that time it has mocked me dared me to drink to partake of its malty dank body but i have been iron of will and clear of mind other beers have begged attention required consumption or perched testily at the edge of my fridge this one has waited and i have been strong  today though today is dawned bright clear and autumnal the air is crisper than it should be autumn has slid sneakily to my house bringing weather not yet welcome for months it is cool but i wear shorts in stubborn refusal to bow to sensibility it makes me angry i am stubborn and i am steadfast but as afternoon breaks i am wroth and this beer is front and centre  angrily i pour this beer has mocked me but now i call the shots in response it flares its fluffy white warning clouds at me unperturbed i sit and wait still and at one with time ere long it subsides meekly it exposes its dark caramelamber coat easel to its thin offwhite head moderate carbonation follows but king of my liquid domain i barely acknowledge the elemental offering of carbon and oxygen no ritual obeisance will slake my thirst l 425  i offer my nose as the beer unbowed by curt dismissal of its visual defences throws rich chewy caramel notes at me i rebuff the scent but it follows with a volley of umamilaced soy background notes i pause hark my nasal messenger do i detect the glory of the titanic pale ales of my spotted craft beer youth my first stumble the first scintilla of doubt does this bear the ghosts of the pale ales of yesteryear if so can i stand before its glory s 425  i regain my chestforward arrogant composure the taste will not mirror the nose without a doubt a tropical umbrellabedecked fruit tingle lies in ambush beneath the olfactory assault i have endured beer of 2023 can not follow malty talk with commensurate walk but i am mistaken taste mirrors the nose with rich tangy chewy caramel and toffee in backup are deep umami malt notes that envision unearthed deep soil and the bugs that huddle within it follows with moderate danky retronasal bitterness sitting at the back of my tongue building and building before turning back into a long tangy caramel finish this is no tropical fruit bomb i am bereft of defence to this sorcerous beer i twist and turn refusing to partake but am trapped in this beers embrace and it knows it it knows lord it knows i must take more i am slave to this delicious throwback to malty pale ale goodness t 45  it refuses to let up it throws a smooth and full mouthfeel at me as though nought but an afterthought it waves away my loving embrace of its carbonation previously dismissed like so much unwanted chaff this beer knows better and it knows how to play its cards it is harmony yet it has broken mine m 425  this beer has sat in my fridge for six months watching waiting it pounced when i suffused with arrogance sought to bring it to its barleykissed knees instead it reminded me of the power of malty hoppy goodness reminded me that a whole history of beer lies unloved forgotten in our lust for tropical sour and pastry highs discarded as soon as the next sacrifice kneels at the block this beer has held its own after an improbable journey to my fridge and then beaten my senses back into shape as it taught me a lesson i should not have needed to learn and will study for time to come o 45  cheers 212

5718,Weissbier Hell,4.59,enjoying a half liter in their braustuberl which is pretty packed for a german holiday weekend but also surprisingly touristy much busier in the food and beer lines compared to weihenstephaner and much larger outdoor seating area with a similar a la carte ordering system this is i think the last major beer from them i havent tried so i was happy to order it super hazy yeasty and funky not too heavy on the banana and other typical hefe flavors which is why i like this so much this brewery is popular for a reason and their beer is seriously consistent

5723,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,1.68,disgusting shameful this is real crappy beer new belgium has made terrible changes to their beersonce i drain the 24 pack purchased  costco i will steer clear of new belgium beersadi used to appreciate fat tire ipa  their attempts  belgium style beers all we can hope for is their leadership is fired
5724,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,3.54,poured from a can into a pint glass pours yellow orange with a nice white head smells of bright tropical fruit and some fruit punch notes smells processed tastes of tropical fruit but an artificial sense beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation overall an above average beer
5725,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,4,i am transported back to 1969 with the memory of stirring a glass of hawaiian fruit punch from concentrate the fruit taste lasts through out with an underlying taste of voodoo would be good for the ladies that dont like the ipa taste and at 95 abv would be a cheap date
5726,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,4.51,my favorite ipa out right now downing a sixer of these on any off day i can find deliciously juicy and quite hazy lacking the super bitter hops but maintaining enough body to make sure you know what youre drinking nearly perfect beer
5727,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,1.34,this is possibly the worst beer i have ever tried  i have been a beer lover my whole life  i have been drinking beer for over 40 years i never drank american beers even when i started as a teenager in the 1980s i worked my way through every funky high alcohol import i could find back then and loved them all pilsners porters ales ipas clear cloudy thick thin you name it every variation i could find  as an adult i have tried beers all i over asia and europe i can find something to like about almost every beer i have ever trieduntil a ran into fruit force  this is a perfect example of just because you can doesnt mean you should  it tastes like hawaiian punch poured into a mediocre ipa with a half shot of vodka thrown in for good measure  unrefined unnatural and horrible  why  a horrible beer by a decent brewery and i am an alum of colorado state in ft collins  do yourself a favor and stay away
5728,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,1.33,made it through about 23 of a can before realizing this was one of the worst beers ive had not worth finishing 23 and done
5729,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,5,this ipa is amazing i dont understand all the hate it tastes great and gets the job done highly recommend great on a hot summer day my new go too beer this summer
5730,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,3.88,im a big belgium beer fan and have tried many including the ones in the states that try to duplicate honestly i find omegang my preferred not because i live in upstate ny and support local businesses but because they did a fantastic job of duplicating and improving probably why large belgium brewery purchased them  but back to the whole point of this new belgiums new trip into voo doo ranger brand growth  i drink all of them especially the imperial ipa which is my preferred but in the scorching texas heat it is nice to have a strong ipa with hints of fruit and citrus that tastes light but gives you a bang for the buck  now there a many other belgium golden ales that blow this juice for ipa out of the park but for the price its not bad if you are just chilling in the heat and want some refreshing beer  note i drank the juicy force before the fruit force and think the juicy is much better
5731,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,1.32,what the what seriously i just grabbed this at the store because you know new belgium normally knocks it out of the park i didnt even see the fruit punch ipa text at the bottom of the label i just thought oh a new belgium i havent tried talk about a disappointment i literally signed up for beer advocate just so i could complain about this disaster  my wife actually asked me if i just ate a fruit gummy candy right after i opened the can i hadnt even taken a sip im beyond amazed that new belgium even let this crap out at all unless theyre trying to target elementary students creepy but that is how it tastes never again

5742,Imperial Jack,3.55,somewhat british in nature rhinelander brewing takes that uniquely sweet hoppy and balanced taste and simply amps it up  imperial jack leaps right out with a lightly foggy honey amber for a slight orange appearance a foamy and froathy cap gives a slight sandy hue that soon succumbs to its strength  strong malt aromas portray bold elements of peppery hops and their citrusy herbal stone fruit and grassy perfumes with a balanced scent of toast honey and nutiness flavors of sweetness soon follow with an earthysweet taste of caramel barley corn buttered toast sorghum and biscuit  a rise of british hop flavors reveal aspects of tree bark earthen peat and light walnut provide a nealry tobaccolike sweetness to bridge the sweeter early palate with a more earthen midtaste trending toward the bitterness of fresh cut grass and resiny pine the balanced but not overly complex beer fares well but not nearly to the extend of the high ibu rates prescribed by the style  full bodied to start the beers sweet weight persists into a worty finish with a candied hop balance finishing maltysweet and residing slightly on the sweeter side of bittersweet the beer may fare well in traditional england as a strong or stock ale but todays imperial ipa have drier more bitter and more hop aromatic standards
5743,Imperial Jack,3.43,865
5744,Imperial Jack,3.03,this is definitely not a stellar beer but it is actually drinkable smashableyou just need to give it some help it looks like a good micro the aroma is kinda skunky and soapy with a hint of malt base taste is a bit dank and has almost an apple cider noteagain the bit of soapiness yet it is not terrible for a cheap dipa reminds me of new belgium imperial ranger ipa the flavor grows on you but i personally never forget that this is really not good cheers
5745,Imperial Jack,1.5,dark orange very murky  decent white head strong lacing  not much of a nose just a hint of malts  citrus faint  heavy mouthfeel  flavor is faint  bad like licking an aluminum can hops are nowhere to be found i can only hope i got a very old bottle a bit bitter on the back end but calling this an double ipa is ridiculous  not going to finish this one
5746,Imperial Jack,5,dark bold and one my favorite cheaper than every other double with just as good taste you like heavy beer this is your beer
5747,Imperial Jack,4,not sure why people rated it so poorlyi enjoyed it if you like more of a malt forward aipa its pretty good not too hoppy and doesnt really go down like a double ipa or an ipa its definitely different i can smell and taste some banana goes down smooth for an 85 6 pack for 699 cant go wrong
5748,Imperial Jack,1.12,imperial jack is the weirdest beer ive ever tasted it cannot be an imperial ipa rather its a dank lager with a hint of fumes which escape slightly from the corpses of long dead hops which are completely overpowered by a mash filled dripping sweat sock of malt the aftertaste hits you in the face like a mud  footed bullying jackrabbit leaving you grimacing and saying to yourself wtf was that its only saving grace is the alcohol content so after a couple bottles you dont feel bad for having bought a six pack of this swill
5749,Imperial Jack,3.01,by the date code on my bottle containing 2017 and this being early february i think i bought a fresh bottle the aroma was of an old beer gone bad maybe improper handling maybe a confirmation of previous review this tasted like an experimental recipe of a a friend who homebrews time to change it up
5750,Imperial Jack,4.15,im a huge minhasrhinelander fan being from wisconsin imperial jack is a dam good beer at a low price point you cant argue with that
5751,Imperial Jack,2.71,aroma is fairly strong and hoppy with a hint of sour citrus but not remarkable it pours a clear amber with a soso pale head that doesnt last too long flavor is hoppy a little bitter just slightly fruity barely says its an ipa  let alone a double ipa texture is smooth and firm none too fizzy though it leaves a hoppy and woody finish and a persistent tingle on the lips fair to middlin and leanin towards fair give it a try anyway
5752,Birra Peroni,2.36,bottle to shaker pint at a fine restaurant in phx crystal clear pale straw appearance with a minor soapy white head that sticks with medium bubbles sweet and bready minor fruity floral characteristics highly carbonated easy drinking but not much to it
5753,Birra Peroni,3.25,drunk at the spuzzuliamm pizzeria in napoli italy 067 liter bottle  look shows a light golden color with a small foam head and lacing left behind smell light bready hints and floral taste breaady taste feel light bodied well carbonated beer overall it is a good beer
5754,Birra Peroni,5,lots of fives  from my heart  soul  lots of fond memories peroni red ao rosso the most popular beer in italy its been maybe twenty plus years since its been available in the united states replaced by nastro a different animal i dream about peroni red we eat pizza spaget ital chow all the time red was at every italian restaurant that sold beer it was the go to i can see that tap or that nice looking brown bottle with the red  white label folding a hot slice in one hand a cold peroni in the other a beer that belonged anise that anise taste  smell felt so good someone should have it for sale in the usa help
5755,Birra Peroni,3.31,perfectly fine mass lager from italy made in bari roma padova i prefer this to other moretti forst italian lagers bravo much better than a heinekin too when in italy order peroni
5756,Birra Peroni,2.75,bottle and draught very light golden colour moderate head neutral pilsener flavour yes another one drinkable but nastro azzurro is better
5757,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.53,resinous and bitter in the first sip with a rounded citra sweetness each sip gets less bitter and rounder extremely smooth going down but the mouthfeel could leave more to be desired aroma is a huge citra bomb and i wish they made candles like this pretty dang hazy too exactly what youd expect in a neipa
5758,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.34,canned 4623  i had the og ghost in the machine early last year and while i enjoyed it quite a bit i found the hop burn to be a bit of a problem with it a ddh version sounds like it could make things even worse on that front but this is a highly regarded beer so i had to order it when i saw it on tavour lets crack it open and see what its all about  pours a hazy milky yellow with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  the nose is aggressive here but its aggressive in a great way that does not suggest hop burn im picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe pineapple juice orange juice bready malt grassy hops dank weed white pepper and a touch of caramel  and unfortunately this one also gets a bit too aggressive in taste but im still enjoying it on the front end of the sip im tasting earthy hops orange juice dank weed overripe cantaloupe bready malt white pepper and light pine the swallow brings notes of earthy hops dank weed orange juice overripe cantaloupe pithy grapefruit bready malt pine pineapple juice and an odd hint of gasoline  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a slick beer finishes mostly dry and bitter because of the hops burn but it eventually settles out  i really wanted this one to be better than the original but its really about the same a bit less hop burn leads to a greater drinkability but the odd gasoline note prevents me from bumping up the taste score
5759,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.63,poured from a 16oz can into a veil willi becher pint glass pours a thick milky hazy orange with a finger of bright white foam candied melons and oranges on the nose maybe even a little peach as it warms big citrus in the taste slightly bitter finish but overall juicy and smooth thick full mouthfeel incredible nedipa
5760,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.54,sweet orange citrus hoppy slightly malty and an orangetangerine hoppydank nose on this one taste follows with an orangegrapefruit citrus slightly malty and hoppy bitter swallow this is nice and murkysoftwith some juiciness midpalate this is fantastic
5761,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,5,ddh ghost in the machine pours a hazy golden color with a fluffy white head that leaves behind a beautiful lacing on the glass  the aroma is incredibly inviting with prominent notes of tropical fruit citrus and pine the double dryhopping process really shines through in the aroma with a depth and complexity that is unmatched  on the palate the beer is just as impressive the first sip is bursting with juicy hop flavors with mango passionfruit and grapefruit dominating the taste profile the bitterness is wellbalanced and not overpowering allowing the fruity flavors to shine through there is also a slight sweetness to the beer likely from the malt bill which provides a pleasant balance to the bitterness  the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a medium body that coats the tongue and leaves a pleasant aftertaste the carbonation is just right providing a refreshing bite without being too fizzy  overall parish brewing cos ddh ghost in the machine is an outstanding beer that deserves all the accolades it has received it is a beautifully crafted ipa that is both complex and balanced with a flavor profile that will please both hopheads and beer novices alike highly recommended for anyone looking for a topnotch ipa experience
5762,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.49,12 oz bottle cold into a can glass pours hazed orange white foam big time aroma hops hops and juicy juice taste follows exactly citra hops really dominate in the best possible way grapefruit lemon  orange flavors compete for dominance then the resiny hops chase everything down the throat leaving a great fruity bitter finish with a hint of alcohol burn feel is medium heavy mediun carbonation overall citra is the sensation in this well executed neipa
5763,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.21,draft poured into a 9 oz collins glass looks like orange juice in the bar light hazy nice foamy head good lacing citrusy smell lemony taste initially but then becomes piney hoppy overall an exemplar of neipa not my favorite style but i think ill have another
5764,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.47,this was a share at my local beer enthusiast club bottle shop iron  glass look is orange haze smells of citra to the second power absolute juice bomb medium feel overall an amazing ne ipa
5765,Cara Pils,5,wonderful belgian pils always very handy when youre broke as a nigga would definitely recommend
5766,Cara Pils,1.3,i drank a can of this beer at a friends place he hated them but didnt want to throw them away it is a beer generally drunk by homeless people on the street to give you an idea it looks like a regualr pils beer although much lighter it has a very unfresh smell and the flavor is awful cant really put my finge rto what it is eaxctly but i never tatsed something like that before the beer also leaves a very penetrating flavor and felling in the mouth definitely the worst beer i ever drank
5767,Cara Pils,1.69,cara pils is generally drank because it is the cheapest beer available in the belgian market thus is carries a bit of a stigma in belgium people drink this for the sale purpose of getting drunk as cheaply as possible when they have absolutely no money it is crap but it is ridiculously cheap i mean really really cheap buying an equal amount of water at the supermarket costs more money than this beer  second note i believe that piedboeuf doesnt brew this no one actually brews cara pils they just buy this stuff from whatever brewery makes it the cheapest sometimes contracts change i have heard that they put failed batches from several pils brewers into this stuff probably including stuff from piedboeuf the french brewery champigneulles tcb beverages who specializes in this kinds of beers most likely makes most of this stuff these days  review bright clear golden urinecoloured with little brief white head musty wet corn in the nose hay dirty water rotting lemon watery corn wet and dusty rotting hay light rotting touch metallic rotting lemon expired medication unnerving bitterness bitter disgusting aftertaste wattery not very good touch better than expected
5768,Cara Pils,2.52,this belgian cultpilsener is not as bad as you would expect its cheap and has a bad image but compared to world famous beers like heineken it can still hold its own on any given summer sunday i prefer an ice cold cara over most popular pilseners  sure the taste is not great it tastes somewhere in between foul and average but at the bargain price of 02633cl this is to be expected bad image aside this is just a regular pilsener which would be much better liked if it was branded better
5769,King JJJuliusss,5,perfect neipa
5770,King JJJuliusss,4.62,l  opaque light orange with a offwhite head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind a good amount of lacing s  orange and mango up front with pineapple and some grapefruit slight notes grassy hops t  tropical forward and throughout  mango and orange dominate intermixed with grassy piney slightly bitter hops along with notes of grapefruit and pineapple  theres some bready malt in there to balance everything out f  full bodied with moderate carbonation fluffy soft smooth o  a truly great and well balanced neipa
5771,King JJJuliusss,4.82,whats left to say about the best of the best of the neipa style i dont know but it pours an absolutely gorgeous opaque turbid chewy looking beast aromas and flavors burst with nevertoobitter juices ridiculously smooth pillowy mouthfeel and soft easy finish just incredible
5772,King JJJuliusss,4.39,poured from a can into a snifter appearance the beer pours a super hazy orangejuice color with a massive puffy white head the head has a great level of retention fading slowly over time and leaving spiderweb lacing all over the sides of the glass smell  the aroma is huge of an orange rind smell mixed with sweet notes of tangerine and orange as well as plenty of herbal hops and a strong showing of pine and earth mixed with thee smells are some juicy pineapple mango and papaya with some citrus hop smell with a ruby red grapefruit other citrus notes of lemon and lime as well as some bready malt and light grain are there as well mixing in with some raw hop smells to produce a rather dank and green hoppy smell overall m taste  the taste begins with a thick bready malt flavor that is composed mostly of a smooth wheat doughy and oaty flavor there is also a moderately sizable fruit flavor upfront with orange and peach being the strongest but with notes of pear and apple and a hint of lemon in there as well the hop is strong from the start as well with a earthy and herbal hop being the most pronounced followed by some notes of pine and floral hops as the taste advances the pine and herb grown stronger while the earth fades bringing more dankness to the tongue that said the sweetness picks up a tad balancing out the hops rather well and with some very raw hop and grassy flavors coming on at the end one is left with a dank but sweeter and malty taste to linger on the tongue mouthfeel  the body of the brew is thick and chewy with a moderate to higher carbonation level quite nice for the thick and dank tastes of the brew and certainly makes for a nice slow sipper overall a quite nice and tasty brew with a lot of hop attitude but a balanced demeaner while not quite up to the hype it is certainly a well crafted brew
5773,King JJJuliusss,4.56,appearance a bubble show lifts the head to a fullsome three fingers perched atop the cloudy goldenstraw colored liquid strong retention with clumps of lacing left behind  smell mango mandarin orange and ruby red grapefruit aromatics with hints of passion fruit pineapple and melon  taste mango pineapple and mandarin orange forward with some melon underneath the passion fruit and ruby red grapefruit emerge in the middle the finish is juicy with moderate bitterness and a touch of hop burn in the aftertaste  mouthfeel medium to full body creamy with moderate carbonation  overall a top quality effort from tree house but very similar to countless others i have had from them
5774,King JJJuliusss,4.29,pours a not sure how describe this color its not golden its not yellow its not brown somewhere between maybe some orange off white head not as pungent aromatically as batch 6000 theres orange grapefruit some textured soapiness idk this is really good is it an improvement on regular ass kj idk the moniker seems excessive the beer is not
5775,King JJJuliusss,4.69,very tropical nose sweet and orangeish like sunnyd with nice acidity and alcohol to balance a wow beer for sure one that sets the bar for how a hazy can taste

5777,Bourbon Paradise,4.55,2019 version poured from a 12oz bottle into a dogfish head snifter on 2152022 aged very well
5778,Bourbon Paradise,4.32,1822 name bourbon paradise style barrelaged imperial stuff location kreb oklahoma abv 137 date 2022  continuing with stouts i chose this from prairie using my jester tulip glass i let the beer warm up to 56 degrees a hard pour created a half finger medium dark tan head the retention is dismal and dropped as fast as it formed the color of the beer charts arounds srm 36 dark brown with ruby hues the beer is opaque but does show some carbonation bubbles on the sides of the glass overall the appearance is average for this style i wanted to see a longer lasting head  nosing the beer i detect dark chocolate vanilla coconut with espresso after smelling the beer several more times i notice caramel bourbon oak hints of floral dates raisins slight char roasted malts bready and a touch of maillard  the chocolate weaves coconut with vanilla seamlessly other flavors in the beer are caramel bready roasted maltiness raisins figs oak bourbon oak anise soy sauce oranges hints of floral maillard and char  the heavy roasted malts gives the beer a heavy body and a low carbonation a chewy thick mouthfeel and a lasting finish  the beer is tasty yet i have a few complaints i wanted more coconut flavors and less char overall the beer is a wonderful example of imperial stout i enjoyed sipping this one on a cold winter night
5779,Bourbon Paradise,4.77,as good as it gets
5780,Bourbon Paradise,4.5,on tap at frisco taphouse in crofton md definitely lives up to expectations  pours pitch black with a tan head huge aromas and flavors of dark roasted malts chocolate coffee bourbon vanilla and some coconut rich and sumptuous mouthfeel stellar
5781,Bourbon Paradise,4.63,its incredibly rich and decadentits deliciousperhaps the thickest creamiest beer ive ever had the bourbon is quite evident as it should be the coconut wafts in and out like a ghostincredibly intense experiencehaving this on black friday morning while cooking a breakfast casserole warming to the belly after a few healthy sipsthis is a real banger  the sort of beer you pull out for just the right moment i love itone is enough due to its intensity and richness  a masterpiece
5782,Bourbon Paradise,4.28,poured from bottle to wine glass super dark color with rich brown head totally opaque head is very small and is soon totally gone there is some lacing however strong scents of soy sauce and dark malt i like this though it is bordering on being too strong taste there is a lot here extremely rich strong flavors of raw coconut bourbon soy sauce roasted malts licorice it is delicious but it is simply too much the beer is creamy and the finish is incredibly long a great beer but it is just not for me
5783,Bourbon Paradise,4.45,look  fantastic looking ba stout black and thick with a really nice thick tan head and fantastic rimming and lacing not sure what you can do better smell  nutty dark chocolate woody smell im sure that nut smell comes from the coconut but i dont get the coconut more just nut maybe some molasses caramel deep in there taste  a little sweet but not overly sweet dark chocolate some char woodiness along with the toasted coconut and vanilla feel  medium full body with a medium light carb slight creaminess overall  i like how the vanilla and coconut arent overly done and instead just bring out some great flavors of the beer in different ways the barrel to this beer is fantastic well done not overly sweet ba stout
5784,Bourbon Paradise,4.56,awesome pricy sure but worth every sip the art of the craft stuck 2 in the cave for xmas
5785,Prima Pils,4.38,i like a pilsner with a little funk that taste of the cellar or cave and prima has a little funk it also has a slight skunkyness which i am less enamored with but the slight skunkyness is dissolved by the hoppy bite at the end all in all one of the best pilsners ive had and one of my favorite brews
5786,Prima Pils,4.16,this is generally considered an american classic take on german pilsner and theres a darn good reason for it  theres a wonderful hoppy bite but it carries the almost spicy neutrality of noble hops not the over the top citrus or tropical fruit of new world varietals its hoppy and bitter but its by no means an ipl drinks crisp and clean with a bready grainy deliver of the malt bill fairly dry finish  its also less complex than the best pilsners but at the same time its not exactly a low volume boutique offering getting this kind of quality from a readily available six pack is frankly pretty impressive
5787,Prima Pils,4.02,the second time ive had this so time to review pours a golden orange with good head smells a little funky skunky and sweet tastes like citrus a little spicy grassy a little skunky but its a good skunk and a nice bitterness from the german hops a good pilsner and a refreshing beer cheers
5788,Prima Pils,4.22,from a tap it was delivered inside a clear pint glass theres some pleasant white head with bright amber colored and nearly translucent liquid beneath typical pilsner hops and malting hit the nose like many of its style brewed in pennsylvania this is an outstanding one with a body thats supple yet both smooth and light it carries the taste near perfectly theres just enough bitterness to the hops as it should be the finish carries that as it becomes dry not much to witness when looking for glass lacing but thats not why people drink beer it may not be the best pilsner brewed in this commonwealth but its better than most made in america
5789,Prima Pils,4.08,best by 72023  appearance pours a completely clear medium golden color with a moderate white head that laces srm of 7 400  aroma strong aromas of floral and lemon citrus hops some yeast with a slight belgian spices of lemon and juicyfruit 400  flavor strong flavors of floral and grassy hops bitter off the front followed by some belgian yeast and some lemon citrus pale malts then with a smooth finish bitter finish 400  feel medium bodied strong carnation grainy bitter and clean 425  compared to fair state pils 52023 pours darker milder head stronger aromas more yeast and belgian spices of lemon and juicyfruit less bitter flower dryer and cleaner  overall a very nice drinking german pilsner here strong floral and bitter hops also with a strong yeast presence that gives hints of juicyfruit dry bitter yeasty and clean seems like it blends a german pils kellerbier with a touch of goodness from golden monkey its complex and drinks well rating 408
5790,Prima Pils,4.3,on draft at trident
5791,Pumking,4.77,best pumpkin imo
5792,Pumking,3.37,bourbony circus peanuts is the first thing that came to mind as i poured the light pumpkin orange translucence into the glass and it settled under two fingers of fastdissipating creamcolored foam a closer sniff said something closer to overripe bananas foster with a hint of nutmeg nutmeg comes up first from a fairly rough mouth feel then something boozy and a little dry that overpowers any fruitiness now it is certainly possible that this has lost a step since it has been sitting in my fridge for a couple months while i abstained from alcohol while not the pumpkin beer i was looking for i will give it another go later this year with a fresh bottle
5793,Pumking,4.58,delicious elegant complex smells great
5794,Pumking,4.2,beautiful amber orange with a tightbubbled thin head light pumpkin with notes of cinnamon brown sugar and strong nutmeg beautifully creamy and smooth nutty pumpkin taste with a very natural pumpkin and cinnamon finish that sits warmly on the palette light body with low carbonation thin ale served in a snifter at world of beer beautiful look and complex and wellbalanced flavor
5795,Pumking,3.78,well within its generous date range poured from a 12oz bottle into a samuel adams perfect pint glass  appearance pumpkin golden oneinch head that dissipated only gradually adequate lacing  nose sweet pumpkin and pumpkin spice inviting  mouthfeel medium heavy  attack pumpkin spice nicely balance by hops carbonation and alcohol evident  finish medium hop bitterness  overall this won a tasteoff i hosted of various pumpkin ales a couple years ago and i have every confidence it would again the only pumpkin ale id rate more highly is avery rumpkin when you can find it but its really in a whole different class
5796,Pumking,3.66,light caramel in color with a slightly white head cant discern too much immediate pumpkin notes that makes me think this is pumpkin pie in a glass definitely some enjoyable cereal grain malt notes it comes off as fairly boozy and at 86 it definitely is i think this is a good beer but its not pumpkin pie in a glass as advertised clove some nutmeg but lots of cereal grains and intermeshed bitter notes im not sure whats going on because a lot of reviews are saying this tastes extremely pumpkin pie like and others are decrying it as being watered down im definitely in the latter camp because this is coming up pretty short in the sweet pumpkin pie regard it is a good and strong imperial beer but comes off closer to a barleywine than a pumpkin ale frankly there might be some quality control issues somewhere in the manufacturing or supply chain that are creating such a variance in assessments of this beer
5797,Pumking,4.37,im not real wordy but this is good stuff not a sweet as quaff on tastes just like pumpkin pie slight bitterness no head slightly cloudy good stuff i would buy again
5798,Pliny The Younger,5,perfect boozy be careful
5799,Pliny The Younger,4.86,ive been chasing this beer for the better part of 13 years today was finally the day 500ml capped bottle into a fuzzy ipa glass  pours crystal clear goldenrod with a slowly building 2 finger foamy white head that sits around patchy stringy lace sticks to the inside of the glass nose is citrus pine grass and sap fresh aggressive resiny very pungent beer opens grass pine and citrus zesty towards the middle with loads of fresh pine unripened tropical fruit and tree sap finishes with a crystal clean bitterness that is dry and lingers in the aftertaste body is light to medium with ample carbonation prickly and lively on the palate and goes down dry with a lingering sticky aftertaste  i may be buying into the hype a bit after all this time but in a category that everyone in the world tries to do 10 times over this is somehow the best of the bunch a near perfect beer in every way this juice is worth the squeeze
5800,Pliny The Younger,4.68,bucket list beer pretty darn good
5801,Pliny The Younger,4.88,fantastic beer very light and golden in color very little head on it much better than pliny the elder theres a very subtle fruitiness to it and it goes down very easily
5802,Pliny The Younger,5,quite literally the nectar of the gods
5803,Pliny The Younger,5,on tap at finleys pub in denver absolutely delicious 
5804,Pliny The Younger,4.5,poured from a 172oz bottle into a snifter at home thanks darin for the share i love the pine in this
5805,Pliny The Younger,4.99,good god man holy shit this is a really good beer having been blessed with national travel for work and fly fishing trips  and the expendable budget to have had the opportunity to try many of the top beers on beer advocate and those celebrated by fellow beer lovers ive had many many ipas from vermont to colorado and new york to california  but my brother and his gang of beer connoisseurs demanded that i join them in boulder colorado for the tapping of a 2023 pliny the younger at the annual celebration at backcountry pizza  taphouse and i couldnt be more delighted that they did  might be best beer that have ever crossed this unrefined pallet perfect all around and holy shit drinkable 
5806,Stella Artois,3.12,22 oz bottle acclimated to 40f and poured into a footed pilsner glass  pours a clear slightly vibrant yellow gold with a 15 finger sudsy head lasting a decent while and leaving about average lacing  initial aroma is marijuana with cumin oddly enough smells yeasty and almost salty but really boring else noticable after agitating i smell a clear bread smell  initial taste before swallowing is skunky with a mellow sweet yeasty background after swallowing i get a big hit of breadiness i quite like which dwindles into the aftertaste but remains appearing somewhere in the middle is a hop presence youd expect from a lager not strong herby being slightly dry and olive green and a little spicypeppery and floral through the entire process exists that skunkiness and it just isnt pleasant its more bitter than i would expect but not enough to slow down my process  mouthfeel is actually impressive definitely has enough body to it to feel substantial i dont think id say creamy but theres a little richness seems as though it glides  overall its about where id expect solid but not great i must say i was surprised how skinny it was which really subtracted from the experience but the other flavors present were nice the mouthfeel was pleasant and made it easy to drink where the flavor put me off a little nice average beer id say  not likely to buy again but i could be convinced if its cheap dont remember how much i paid for it
5807,Stella Artois,3.91,dont be fooled by its look or its smell nothing extraordinary there the canned version of this beer is remarkably smooth without being tasteless it pairs great with a meal in my opinion its a solid beer for its price
5808,Stella Artois,3.76,presentation 12 ounce bottle poured into a beer stein  look light golden color moderate carbonation frothy head that lingers longer than expected  smell primarily smells grassy and flowery moderate hops aroma minor fruity aroma  taste it has a well balanced taste with a variety of flavors it tastes hoppy grassy flowery and even a bit smokey  feel smooth velvety mouthfeel  overall this a good beer very easy to drink but also flavorful very refreshing on an hot day apparently its brewed in saint louis and not in belgium now which is sort of disappointing i would recommend this beer to anyone whos looking for a flavorful lager without any frills this beer is easily better than other european import beers and its readily available at most stores
5809,Stella Artois,3.21,25oz can date code stamp on can bottom  03may24 clear straw colored body two fingers of white head and this reduces slowly leaves behind partial lacing webs aroma of barley grain malts and floral hops taste is mild caramel malts and floralfruity hops with a slight bite mostly early sweetness with mild bitterness at the end medium mouth feel clean finish with some drying excellent carbonation has enough flavor to pair with food and provide enhancement but without stepping on toes
5810,Stella Artois,2.6,look pale straw colour smell barley malt tart smell taste mild malty hoppy flavour feel refreshing fizz of a lager overall bland fizz lager with little to encourage me to buy again
5811,Stella Artois,3.24,poured from a 25oz can into my guinness glass  looks golden slightly goldenbrown not too yellow thick fluffy white head that stayed for a while  smelled that slightly skunky smell that i get on pretty much all lagers smell got worse with every sip as it warmed eventually getting uriney    tastes better than it smells smooth and bready no real topend crispness but very little bitterness full in the middle range  feels smooth too not overly carbonated  waaaay better than standard american lagers id happily drink it if it were offered dont need to go out of my way for it though
5812,Stella Artois,3.48,pours a very pretty crystal clear brass color nice very white cohesive head that settles into some clumpy white islands some of which try to cling to the glass in a show of minor lacing swirling the glass around gives a nice visual as the carb is visible and replenishes the head  nose is a mix of white bread cracker wafer like light macro lager skunkiness and very light floral leaning hops i would stop short of saying floral though  the taste is surprisingly refreshing while cold especially has a generic very light maltiness that carries a very minor touch of sweet reminds me of wonder bread but less doughy some definite hop presence lightly peppery but they are definitely outshined by the malt the malty sweet slowly becomes more powerful as this beer warms  light body slightly effervescent some light sweetness coats the tongue but it finishes surprisingly dry with a lowmoderate bitterness has a nice snappy finish to me as this beer warms it becomes sweeter and has more of a macro lager tastefeel to it  im enjoying this beer a lot more than i thought i would have compared to other mass produced euro lager it actually isnt half bad worth giving a shot in my opinion
5813,Stella Artois,3.34,smell is overwhelmingly skunk taste is smooth though and goes down easily great lawn mowing lager
5814,Cuv√©e De Castleton,3.86,2017 vintage
5815,Cuv√©e De Castleton,4.49,decanted from a 127 oz 375 ml bottle into a conical pint glass 2017 vintage a pours a clear golden color with a shortlived with large bubbled white head disappears rapidly no lacing at all s sharp aromas of apple pear vanilla and chardonnay grapes t semidry and pleasantly tart flavors largely follows the nose very drinkable m medium bodied with medium carbonation goes down very easily o well made highly palatable sour which i could see in numerous pairings a bit pricey
5816,Cuv√©e De Castleton,4.23,2017 bottle has higher 84 abv great sour with strong grape notes and smell some toasted oak although this brewery has better options  hops nroses
5817,Cuv√©e De Castleton,4.38,great grape prefer this to rosso and hops n roses all other beerwine hybrids could learn something from this beer
5818,Black Butte Porter,4.19,an excelent porter very distict roasted nut flavor and smell definitely on the better end of the spectrum of this style kudos
5819,Black Butte Porter,4.58,very nice malty taste definitely a beer to sip and savor my favorite porter and its local too
5820,Black Butte Porter,3.83,decadent dark chocolate malt truffle on the smell body is largely the same with biting bitter cacaoinfused malt followed by mellower milk chocolate truffle and espresso its a great porter not quite as much a class act as deschutes stout though
5821,Black Butte Porter,4.34,pours darkest of browns nice light brown head creamy looking it leaves quickly but a nice persistent film remains just minor lacing from initial head nothing after that  nose is nicely rich roast powdered chocolate light coffee all present pretty evenly a light fruit skin like twang to it  taste is so bold yet so drinkable light dark chocolate with a bite of slightly overroasted coffee light sweetness with a nice ever so slightly piney finish chocolate lingers in the form of cocoa powder and light roast  mouthfeel again like the rest of this beer bold at first but just for an instant quickly becomes incredibly drinkable and almost light there is nice little bit of hop bite on a finish that is remarkably dry much like the nose hinted at it has a twang on the finish light light fruit skin like acidity
5822,Black Butte Porter,4.35,l pours a dark brown reddishcolor with a small brown tan head and no lacing  s a nice roast malt with hints of smoked meat a rich chocolate and a touch of caramel  t earthy and roasted malt with some bittersweet chocolate and a medium to stronger bitterness  f smooth and medium body  o this is a classic and always a good one to have
5823,Black Butte Porter,4.14,not used to having this on the east coast and ran into this on draft at the capital ale house in harrisonburg va as my wife and i are traveling i enjoy porters and rips and this a very nice porter i wish i could get it back in maine where i live oh well got it once
5824,Black Butte Porter,4.13,12oz bottle packaged 111622 5 months ago poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp 55 abv 30 ibu the beer pours medium brown with mahogany highlights and khaki colored head the head recedes to an irregular ring and rocky island the aroma is mild with black coffee and dark chocolate the taste is more of the same with the roasted malt being prevalent and the earthy hops following behind with a moderate bitterness mouthfeel is thin bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish overall very good
5825,Black Butte Porter,4.25,look black nearly opaque deep reddishbrown when held to light with a tan head  smell coffee some dark chocolate and earthy notes  taste follows smell mostly bold bitter coffee not so much of the chocolate sweetness  feel mediumfull body normal carbonation leaves kind of a dry mouthfeel  overall very solid porter pretty easy drinking id say not as sweet as some ive had but i wasnt too bothered by that
5826,Black Butte Porter,3.75,was a tad too bitter for my tastes
5827,Black Butte Porter,4.58,an excellent porter from a fine brewery
5828,Black Butte Porter,4.16,12oz bottle poured into a weizen glass at room temp  no discernible bottling date  pours dark black with a fair tan head  incredibly rich chocolate and roasty coffee nose  dark chocolatey sharp and extra creamy  fairly easy drinking and crushable
5829,Carlton Draught,2.51,650 aud per 570ml pint at paddys irish pub port douglas australia  innocuous little brew hitting on 6row minerality and some buttery notes but little else lacks overt hop flavour or any malty richness  suffers from subdued though present metallic off flavour  not much good for anything save quenching thirst in the queensland heat but not terrible for what it is  overcarbonated not unrefreshing a bit creamy  high d  not recommended   123022 middy as part of a 20 aud steak  fry  beer deal at beaches bar airlie beach australia  ive had worse and this is relatively innocuous  c  below average
5830,Carlton Draught,1.89,can best by june 29th 2019  it pours a clear gold with an ample head of foam  big corny notes in the smell hints of vegetables wee bit of bitterness  taste is below that of xxxx gold too much cornvegetal metallic  body is not better than the xxxx despite its higher abv  pretty poor beer
5831,Carlton Draught,2.06,used to be a fantastic beer on tap is still okish but in bottle the chemicalmetallic after taste ruins it never buying again
5832,Carlton Draught,1.03,somewhat refreshing and mildly attractive but the strong chemical taste feel and smell ruin this lager
5833,Carlton Draught,5,i love carlton draught it is one of the best beers in the world the look smell taste and feel are comparable with any beer in the world i could and do drink this beer all day why is carlton draught called an american adjunct lager if there is such a thing as heaven and if i do make it there one day i imagine breasting the bar having a carlton draught with god while watching the carlton football club win a premiership
5834,Michelob Golden Draft Light,2.28,16 oz draft pour at a twins game i was intrigued by the first sip which showed this beer is more flavorful than and superior to bud light however a few sips in my interest dropped to near zero ultimately its still a watery light beer with hints of barley malt and maybe hops maybe not who can say
5835,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.48,16oz aluminum can purchased at busch stadium and consumed from the bottle smells vaguely beery the taste is very light malt a hint of orchard fruit and lightly tart no real bitterness or hop presence very light bodied with high carbonation and a mostly dry fairly clean finish overall ok but id rather have bought a 30 pack of hamms for the money
5836,Michelob Golden Draft Light,4.74,its a good tasting beer the new can looks good
5837,Michelob Golden Draft Light,1.19,12oz bottle eb oct 2222 into a 12oz becher l pours light radiant clear yellow w a thin white head going quickly to edge foam lite carbo no lacing s corn grains clean  simple t grains a hint of caramelized malts lite bitterness adjunct waft at finish does not taste wellblended f lightly brisk colalike clean somewhat smooth lite bodied fast lightly dirty finish that is a little dry o it is slightly more rich than other light aal beers in this style but the taste of this beer does not appeal to me esp the adjunct flavors in the finish i believe there are other better tasting and more satisfying beers in this style that should be sought out
5838,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.25,my second favorite light beer beats out natural light my 3 for better body and smoother finish in my opion beats miller coors and bud lights hands down for the record lienenkugals light is my 1
5839,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.84,appearance pours a completely clear light pale golden color with a mild white head srm of 56 375  aroma mild to moderate aromas of pale malts white bread malts some white adjuncts on teh finish but has a fullbodied aroma  flavor mild flavors of pale malts white cracker lots of yeast a smooth light honey malt sweetness on the end but also finishes dry finishes smooth  feel medium to light bodied strong carbonation a smooth malt sweetness on the end  compared to miller light 72921 pours a slighty lighter color more cracker and dry yeast aromas less corn and adjunct malts dryer and cleaner  overall better than i expected for a light adjunct lager this one drinks with a nice balance of carbonation yeast and sweet malts on the finish a pretty nice light beer hard to beat miller light in a beer contest but this one was pretty good final rating 384
5840,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.6,pours a clear light golden yellow color smell is grain and barley wth some malts taste has slight hops with some grassy notes cracker bread malts  mouth feel is crisp and refreshing its an aal so to style very tasty crisp and drinkable 
5841,Michelob Golden Draft Light,2.7,light straw smallest hint of light malt on the nose same in the flavor wow thats a boring beer slightest spice technically refreshing but so is water
5842,Michelob Golden Draft Light,4.15,smells like biscuits mouthfeel is crisp and cold
5843,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.2,poured from can into a pint glass  appearance  the beer is pours a light golden color with a billowy white head of fizzy foam the head fades very fast to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass  smell  the aroma of the beer is light overall but consists of some cracker and bread as well as a bit of corn and caramel sweetness there is a little bit of light hop as well as some light papery aromas  taste  the taste begins light and crisp with a cracker and lightly corn and caramel sweetened taste the tastes are light upfront appropriate for a light brew and continue so throughout there is a little loss of sweetness as the taste advances and along with some increases in a grassy hop and a little bit of grainy malt flavor one is left with a light and crisp taste to linger on the tongue  mouthfeel  the body of the brew is quite light and thin with a carbonation level that is high for the light brew style the feel is great and makes this an easy drinking session style brew overall  overall  for the style this is a rather decent light adjunct not super flavorful but low cal easy drinking crisp and sessionable
5844,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3,tastes better cold  from a can get some barley on the nose tasting it gets me barley with a finish of hops it definitely gets the job done and is better than the heavy version
5845,Oktoberfest,3.34,not a fan of this one looked great in my sam adams oktoberfest mug but went downhill from there aroma foretold the sweetness that was to come also some earthiness and slight alcohol comes through flavor wise its too sweet for my liking but did have a little roasty earthiness to it and a slight bitterness on the end not enough to save it though alcohol poked out as it warmed glad i only bought a single
5846,Oktoberfest,4.19,draft pour into standard shaker pint glass light brown nearly seethrough and not much foam malty and breadlike on the nose with a light hop presence taste follows but i like it better than the nose mediumfull mouthfeel with a crisp finish this is like oktoberfest lite or at least its very easy drinking for 6
5847,Oktoberfest,3.79,pours a clear copper color with a nice head and lacing aroma has bready and malt hints taste has bready and malt flavors a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a decent marzen
5848,Oktoberfest,4.24,having lived long enough in austria to be able to tell what makes a good marzen and this one i know for sure is an excellent take on it the good thing is that it doesnt try to carbon copy a marzen but it takes it further instead makes the malts more caramelized puts more hops into the aroma and brings more richness and excitement into the whole deal sometimes marzens can get too sweet and overwhelming but this one does not this one feels like a craft marzen and not just a regular one but one made in the us  which made me realize once again how great and outstanding american craft beers are oktoberfest and a german marzen gets born again to beome a hop infused fresh and excellent craft brew with full of life i liked it a lot never get disappointed by founders
5849,Oktoberfest,3.73,poured into a grip shaped goblet color is copper transparent head presents 12 inch thick and dissipates quickly to thin top spotty lacing on the glass sides  smell is caramel toast honey malt light earthy hops  taste is thinner than most american oktoberfests threads the marzenfestbier styles with a grainy flavor intermixed with the caramel and german malts limited grape nut like note with more caramelhoney flavors  mouthfeel is lighter on the carbonation moderate sweetness crisp finish  overall this presents as a hybrid of the festmarzen styles  more grainyness less munich malt than the sweeter oktoberfest americanized versions and more caramel than the lighter festbier styling
5850,Oktoberfest,3.81,look it pours amber with a white head retention is excellent  smell it has bready and toasty aromas there are low spicy notes in the background  taste it has bready and toasty flavors with a bit of sweetness up front there are very low herbal elements in the background  feel it has a smooth texture with slight alcohol warming  overall the flavor is fairly sweet throughout the flavor tasting including the finish it does have nice toasty bready elements
5851,Oktoberfest,3.93,canned on 072222 poured a golden amber color into a standard pint glass brite white finger high head with tons of visible fizzy carbonation and spotty lacing aroma is mainly malty with earthy and biscuit overtones taste of honey malts with hints of spice permeate throughout light to medium in body is more in tune with the austrian style of m√§rzenbier smooth dry finish and very drinkable one of the top american version of this type of beer
5852,Oktoberfest,3.71,a the beer is crystal clear yellow in color and has hues of orange along with a light to moderate amount of visible carbonation it poured with a short white head that quickly settled down and left a thin collar around the edge of the glass s moderate aromas of sweet malts are present in the nose t the taste follows the smell but is also accompanied by a moderate amount of bitterness and hints of spiciness from the hops m it feels a bit more than lightbodied and a bit crisp on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation there is some dryness in the finish o this beer seems to be much lighter in body compared to other beers in the style its easy to drink but not as malty  serving type can
5853,Oktoberfest,4.04,in a can hearty and flavorful big taste almost ale like decent brew especially in a cold day
5854,Golden Monkey,4.55,a solid affordable tripel not quite as complex as la fin du monde funky with sweetness and bananaspicebready nutmegallspice to balance flavors linger on the palate in a pleasant way its well worth its price
5855,Golden Monkey,4.19,i notice the rating as a little lower than i would have thought and my question is where are you gonna find a widely available american tripel for this price and quality pours a bright orange cold with nice head as per the style but doesnt explode out of the glass smells funky yeasty moldy as expected taste is of the heralded spice light clove and banana some other fruit and a crisp hop bite at the end its similar to belgian ales but its also its own thing a solid version of one of my favorite styles kudos to victory for this beer and ive said it before but it bears repeating i like this brewery
5856,Golden Monkey,3.19,sugar spice and something mystiqal complex flavor profile combines banana citrus spicy phenols and a wellbalanced malt and hop smells spicy tastes fruity  spicy medium body and sodalike overall an easy tripel
5857,Golden Monkey,3.87,really like the spice element reminds me of boulevard 6th glass a bit very refreshing with a bit of a punch
5858,Golden Monkey,3.79,12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter  fairly easy drinking tripel dry and spicy with enough sweetness from bready malt and dried fruit flavor to balance the sharp spicy bitterness mouthfeel is mediumlight with crisp edges
5859,Golden Monkey,4.47,poured from 12ounce bottle into a tulip glass hazy almost opalescent dark reddishamber in color with an evanescent white head that collapsed to a thin ring lovely aromas and flavors of the typical belgian tripel with notes of dark fruit caramel dark bread coriander orange zest and of course yeasty funk to round it out medium bodied well balanced not at all boozy and a clean and mostly dry finish i could envision sitting around the dinner table breaking bread and drinking this with a bunch of trappist monks whatever your dreams though this is worthy highly recommended
5860,Golden Monkey,3.86,poured from a 192 oz can with a drink by date of 2092015 into a snifter glass l pours a medium to dark amber color with a frothy white head that dissipates quickly s  smells spicy t  tastes fruity and spicy f  medium body and carbonation o  nice boozy tripel
5861,Golden Monkey,3.81,may as well keep the tripel train going this was recommended to me by several patrons at my beverage center so i picked one up in a stovepipe 192oz can for 249  l pours a translucent goldenamber with a 3 finger rocky khaki head that dissipates into a decent cap minimal lacing is left behind  s light malt sweetness mild banana mild fruitiness and mild hops fairly mild for a tripel  t flavors follow the nose but the fruitiness is a bit more pronounced mild apples pears and banana mix with the malt there is an alcoholic bite in the finish not bad but definitely not as good as others in the style  f smooth yet slightly rough around the edges medium bodied and ample carbonation definitely not as smooth as others in the style  o this is fairly good especially for the price cheaper than la fin or westmalle but you get what you pay for if this is all you have available to you in the way of tripels itll do the job
5862,Ground State,4.28,appearance  the beer poured a silky black color with tan bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass  smell  the nose was like fresh ground coffee the good kind  taste  the initial taste was like fresh coffee it had hints of maple and brown sugar the sweetness was not overbearing and had a bit of nuttiness the sweet coffee lingered in the aftertaste  mouthfeel  though not exceptionally thick the beer had viscosity  overall  my 2018 bottle was a bit faded but quite nice
5863,Ground State,4.27,2017 version poured from a bottle into a snifter really nicely blended with a little heat in the finish
5864,Ground State,4.88,nice bba stout notes of coffee maple oak vanilla and bourbon
5865,Stille Nacht,4.29,served in a tulip glass from the bottle  appearance hazy brown colored body with a white head which comes off very foamy with an initial rise of over one fingers length off the body  smell bland aroma of caramel and malt its almost the fermentation smell when you visit a brewery not the most pleasant but the worst  taste complex toffee and vanilla with a mild cinnamon notes very addicting taste think of barley and honey meshed to with the above to make an addicting brew which is hard to keep down  mouth medium to strong carbonation depends how long you let it sit for softens a bit after you let it settle sticky body which stays with you but not as super potent  overall a gem could use tweaking but honestly why mess with something that is not broken salud
5866,Stille Nacht,4.31,2022 batch bottle sampled out of season on may 20 2023  attractive cloudy looking orangeamber appearance underneath a boisterous fluffy cream colored head that never quite dissipates lacing and legs  inviting aromas of belgian yeast dark bread crust banana grape nutmeg coriander and just a whiff of that 12 alcohol  medium to full mouthfeel soft and delightful  sweet bread and belgiany taste with bread herbs and spices maybe brown sugar tannin and a warming alcohol bite that keeps it mildly dry at the finish i am drinking it in may but this is something i would enjoy as much on a cold winter night
5867,Stille Nacht,4.37,300ml bottle into a brugges glass 2018 release so over 4 years old  nice looking beer amberyellow body with a persistent bright white head sweet boozy aroma tastes outstanding warming fairly sweet with a full mouthfeel
5868,Stille Nacht,4.5,nice to be sampling this seasonal upon the appropriate season uneventful cap pry pours a translucent limeyamber hue with effervescent capper which dissipates into a gurgling ring and mists upon surface slight but persistent carbonated bubbles abound nose is of fruity esters and prominent yeastybeasties taste is indeed of tart apples bitter grapefruit as the hop presence asserts itself underscored by a certain notdomineering sweetness swish of the tongue is complex bittersweet the rather potent abv jabbing along the gumline swallow is largely dry and fizzy light but deep body and a bittersweet finish as it descends down the throat id easily label this tripelish if under a blind taste test  for a holiday ale i suppose i was expectant of a bit more sugar  spice but its quite a nice pairing with this winter chill
5869,Stille Nacht,4.19,116oz bottle no dating information found cloudy deep gold colored body it took three pours because of the rising head to empty the bottle the white head rises and then coalesces to a thick cap and ring aroma of green apple and coriander expressive yeast taste is a combination of flavors  dark fruit and green apple toasted malt and fruity hops tangerine and lime the malts hold the hops in the aftertaste medium plus mouth feel has a certain stickiness along with a sour cleansing bite the head is forever very supportive carbonation the brew balance allows for a open exploration of the nose and flavors  all of which are well expressed
5870,Stille Nacht,4.22,bottled and purchased from beermoth from manchester city centre pours a warming if slightly hazy amber body with splatterings of white head aroma is candied peel flavour is candied peel
5871,Stille Nacht,4.18,2022 vintage bottle to wine glass  l pours a murky brownish orange with a huge foamy head plenty of very fine yeast sediment floating around  s apple spices a bit of cherry and some grassy notes  t green apple and white grapes paired with grassy herbal notes malty and tart at the same time  f very juicy and rather light bodied medium carbonation  o great christmas beer with a nice acidic twist pretty much what you would expect from de dolle brouwers
5872,Stille Nacht,4.12,look is retarded gentle pour and im waiting hour for the head to dissipate sorry not into it  smell nice fruity esters and belgian yeast whats not to like  taste  fruity everescent quintessiential  feel  vibrant refreshing crisp bright  overall  a very nice beer apart from the frothy look of taking a piss in a creek i cant say anything bad about it
5873,Stille Nacht,4.69,pours opaque dark gold in color with one quarter inch head taste is big apples hay candied sugar and belgian spice light bodied moderate carbonation slightly sweet wow is this great excellent combination of funk and sweet so many layers of flavor happy i picked this up
5874,Trois Pistoles,4.17,what a good looking pour on this one drank from a tulip glass liquid is almost stout like  its so dark offwhite foamy head whit thick lace on the glass im thinking tis is a rum barrel aged brew feel is somewhat dryer than i care for or expected but i am enjoying it
5875,Trois Pistoles,4.34,poured from 12oz bottle to a goblet glass look is dark brown with a tan head that falls to a thin cap lots of bubbles rising up to the top which you can see around the sides of the glass aroma includes dark bread spices including black pepper some dark fruits including raisin and plum taste is bold all the way through starts with spices like black pepper clove continues with brown bread yeast black cherry cola finish is spicy fruity and lingers for a while feel is lighter side of medium a lively carbonation nice overall the alcohol is noticeable here a good reminder to slow down this is an excellent beer and would really hit the spot come winter as a slow sipper on a cold day
5876,Trois Pistoles,4.25,this belgian dark strong ale pours a deep dusky brown with a massive tan head and aromas of belgian yeast caramel malts and dark fruits including raisin fig plum and black cherry the flavor profile includes rich bread malt caramel dark fruit sweetness belgian yeast and spices with a smooth slightly sweet finish medium to heavierbodied with strong carbonation its an authentic interpretation of the style that is exceptionally drinkable the appearance is a dark brown with a fluffy tan head good retention and lacing the taste is fruity with a mild spice note and finishes pretty dry overall its an excellent beer

5881,G'Knight,4.17,hazy red brew with an offwhite head hoppy nose evocative of grapefruit rich thick malty sweetness  also plenty of flowery fruity hoppiness warming this would have enthralled me in the 90s today im into subtler beers
5882,G'Knight,3.99,draught nearly clear medium dark orange with the slightest auburn tint nice allspice tinged medium dark toast caramel malt with a bit of fruitiness to the aroma some sharpness upfront lightly astringent bit of allspicecoriander type sweet spice in the background with a bit of a floral note to the taste and finish
5883,G'Knight,4.25,appearance  the beer poured a brownish maroon color with a white head  smell  the smell malts and dank hops were just right for the style  taste  the malts backbone was huge leaving a trail of sweetness the dank and grassy hops provided a nice contrast nothing was overpowering and a dry finish left me thirsty for more  mouthfeel  the beer was full bodied allowing the aftertaste to linger  overall  it has been too long since i had this one
5884,G'Knight,4.27,terrific red imperial ale
5885,G'Knight,3.12,too hoppy for my taste otherwise a very solid beer for the style but not red more of a slightly darker honey old chub is much better to me this tastes like the rest of the ipas in this style

5887,G'Knight,2.95,chilled 12 oz can poured into a chilled mug canned 082821 stamped on bottom of can consumed 110621 my wife bought a single can of this randomly for me to try it is the highestranked beer on this site that i have consumed to date rated 3 in the red ale  imperial style and 3096 overall at time of writing  l dark amber with a moderate amount of foam a slight amount of bubbles 375  s hard to put a finger on what this smells like smells like it will taste sour it has notes of a typical ipa but different 30  t tastes about like it smells kind of weird it has a harshness that sort of overpowers the other flavors of the beverage this is a higher abv than i am accustomed to which might account for the issues bitterness from hops is about the only other thing i can discern i get no sweetness at all even as the brew warmed 275  f not very easy or enjoyable to drink 30  o not for me 30
5888,G'Knight,3.92,yet another great oskar offering beautiful to behold with deeper colors at the top of the glass i guess just because the top is wider anyway a cool effect maybe just a little malty with the high alcohol content but great mouthfeel
5889,Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.06,i had this on draft 9523  the hopleaf  cloudy dull orange appearance  big khaki head a thick curtain of treerung lacing remained  artisanal soap fresh flowers mild banana  faint clove notes in the rather bold nose  creamy medium mouthfeel  banana cream lemon  mild fresh flower flavors up front dry clove notes on the finish  smelled a bit more interesting than it tasted but overall this is a fine tripel

5895,Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.26,330 ml bottle production date 06092021 purchased cold single from pinocchios in media today poured into a st bernardus goblet  l pale brassyamber liquid fluffy pillow of foam atop which gracefully breaks up into a messy collar and cratery cap laces a little but that messy collar retains  s buttery biscuit with grainy perimeter tones perhaps some mealy oxidation creeping in touch of underripe banana skin maybe a hint of coriander but not much subtle accents of phenolic booze and nutty earthy yeast overall relatively bold intensity approaches threshold of depth gradually reveals a floral herbal overtone  t oh yes spiced for sure much coriander perhaps some orange peel especially in the finish citrus oils semblance of pith a few sips in and its malt background begins to fill in lightly pancakey with a ghostly metallic highlight its citrusy fruitiness slowly builds in the aftertaste on the palate floor really helping to fill in its vertical spectrum of jagged flavorings  f very delayed emergence of warmth in the thorax lightbodied but with a luscious oily undercurrent delicately foamy approach but the spice and booze cleave it hard in the finish  o quite pleased with this tripel first time in a long while finding single small bottles of it did not expect the big spicyherbal punch kinda cant lay off of it mmm 2053
5896,Gouden Carolus Tripel,3.09,not my cup of tea nice color and a nice foam you can smell the hops and fruitiness but you can also smell and tast grain gins for me is this beer to strong to taste the real flavors thats too bad
5897,Yellow Bus,4.53,appearance pours a somewhat hazy golden color with a one finger head that fades to a collar squiggles of lacing  smell barnyard funk and tart peach with a floral peach blossom element very oaky  taste vinous peach with barnyard funk and a floral aspect oaky and tart through the middle with a dry somewhat sour finish  mouthfeel medium body with moderate to high carbonation puckery  overall a delightful sour with all the elements in perfect harmony
5898,Narwhal,4.82,this is an outstanding imperial stout deep black it has a large rich brown head steadily but not quickly shrinking but leaving minimal or no lace  aroma is rich and full bodied lots of strong roasty character almost a hint of charcoal some coffee taste has these elements plus hints of chocolate and maybe licorice firm sweetness but not overly sweet by any means with enough bitterness and just enough booziness to support it without also becoming overly bitter or boozy feel is robust moderately full bodied with just a little oiliness without being actually oil or getting heavy and having a tinge of liveliness quite balanced strong in character but easy to drink
5899,Narwhal,4.5,excellentmy first crack at this one
5900,Narwhal,4.21,poured from a 12 oz bottle dated 80522 into a snifter glass l  pours a dark brown almost black color with a slight tan head that dissipates quickly s  smells of booze chocolate and coffee t  tastes of booze coffee and bakers chocolate f  medium to full bodied and lightly carbonated o  nice beer to sip on a cold evening
5901,Narwhal,4.32,2022 vintage  poured from a 12 ounce bottle dated 81822 into a snifter  look black opaque medium brown frothy head average lacing above average head retention  smell coffee cacao toasted oats medium strength of scent  taste coffee cacao toasted oats high strength of flavor  feel full body average carbonation moderately bitter mildly creamy silky mildly mouth coating  overall look was deep black and opaque with above average head retention bouquet was coffee cacao and toasted oats with medium strength flavors were a great balance of coffee cacao and toasted oats with high strength the flavor and nose had similar profiles but the taste stood head and shoulders above the bouquet feel was full body with average carbonation and mildly mouth coating overall this was an enjoyable experience but the bourbon barrel aged version of this beer is superior to this iteration
5902,Narwhal,4.04,12 oz bottle bottled on date fall 2018 consumed on 26 feb 2023 glass snifter abv 102 serving temp    look black with a thin light brown head the head quickly dissolves to a ring and filmy cover  smell dark roasted malts with some char notes of bittersweet chocolate there is an earthy and mildly spicy bitterness as well  taste what is in the nose is here the earthy notes are front and center however along with a more noticeable bitterness as the beer warms the dark and dusty malts join earthy notes as the beer warms further i can detect some espresso and bittersweet chocolate feel viscous and mouthcoating the body is just about full  overall a solid imperial stout that makes a nice winter warmer
5903,Narwhal,3.98,l jet black pour into a sniffer from a 12oz bottle about 6 degrees lacing left behind as the liquid resolves back into liquid form s dark malts dominate the smell on this followed by dark fruits followed by heavy molasses the malt is so dominant that i didnt really smell the bakers cocoa espresso t same as smell intended the malts dominate the flavor but in the end you can sense the slight bakers cocoachocolate not really the espresso but chocolate f very smooth lightly carbonated not acidic heavy bodied thick easy to drink o this isnt a bad imperial id honestly rate it the same as old rasputin with a smoother complex to it as the malts worked in hand with the thick ending with the chocolate for me the malts were a bit to much maybe less malts would be good with the substitution of more bakers chocolate espresso very well done im curious to know how it would turn out if barrel aged or even added more bakers chocolate to the mix very well done
5904,Narwhal,4.18,12 oz bottle into a pint glass opaque motor oil color and consistency minimal tan head faded almost immediately smells of molasses brown sugar maple syrup bittersweet chocolate taste is much more bitter than nose suggested charred malt smoke bitter dark chocolate mediumfull bodied
5905,Narwhal,4.4,purchased at carwyn cellars in march 2022 drunk in january 2023  drunk in company so notes are perfunctory at best  l jet black with a thick dirty white head  s dark rich molasses with umamisoy undertones theres a cola syrup sharpness underneath  t very bitter burnt dark chocolate with rich caramel and ripe red berries some medicinal astringency follows and complements the bitterness well the beer leaves some harsh bready tones in the mouth after the swallow but again it complements the bitterness and astringency well  m mouthfeel is smooth and a nice counterpoint to the heat and bitterness  o excellent beer  an absolute sipper and well worth the time  cheers 193
5906,Narwhal,4.59,this stuff looks as black as old used motor oil its completely delicious and bombards your taste buds chocolaty malty coffee booze i would imagine the bourbon barrel aged version of this would be close to founders kbs this is my new winter favorite
5907,Lou Pepe - Framboise,4.64,enjoyed this in brussels love raspberry and the lambic balance was excellent the beer is relatively acidic to the mouth so be prepared love this as a desert 
5908,Lou Pepe - Framboise,3.5,750 ml corked and capped bottle courtesy of cardinal pub  bar stavanger abv is 5 made with 300 g of raspberries per liter beer clear signal red colour moderate pink head intense aroma of raspberries no surprise the flavour is very sour with notes of lemons and raspberries fairly dry and crisp
5909,Double Barrel Jesus,4.75,2015 bomber into a tulip about as pretty a beer as ive ever seen pitch black with a 1finger khaki head leaving lovely lacing  nose is roasted malt chocolate vanilla bourbon on the palate more roast and much heat followed by a long oaky finish huge body thick and creamy great old school big bba stout  240th beer on the ba top 250 surprisingly hard to track down
5910,Liberty Ale,3.5,as always my caveat i rate the way i do on untappd  i was able to snag an anchor variety pack that has steam california lager tropical haze and liberty ale  as i understand beer history this was one of the first craft ipas released its a good beer but unfortunately by todays standards its barely a pale ale edited to add according to anchors own web site now known as the first american pale ale and the beer that started the ipa movement  poured into my sam adams glass deep gold its got a little bit of malt character and a decent amount of hop bitterness but this beer gets lost in the competition theres nothing really remarkable about it
5911,Liberty Ale,3.75,i had this on draft 62123  the hopleaf  seethrough orange appearance  small white head nice lacing remained  grapefruit peel  mild artisanal soap notes in the nose  medium mouthfeel  grapefruit peel  artisanal soap flavors  solid if unremarkable
5912,Liberty Ale,3.49,its to be respected for what it is but its not what it was anymore even from 10 years ago its not the same quality as it used to be i thought that it was just their branding that changed but apparently not too bad too it was a classic ale
5913,Liberty Ale,3.91,bias alert im not a big fan of west coast ipas some are good most arent  now to the liberty ale  poured a beautiful color of a polished piece of amber lots of bubbles head stuck around for 5 minutes nice lacing taste is strictly that cascade hops taste not too bold but just enough to get that bitter mouthfeel nice carbonation not much of a lingering bitter aftertaste like ive experienced with some beers rebel rouser ranger ipa torpedo definitely a nice refreshing brew  overall i think its a great beer for a hot day or a nice drawn out bbq
5914,Imperial Stout,4.02,could use a taller head lots of dark malts and toasted barleys not super rich on the flavor or sweetness spectrums overall very good but there are much better out there of my taste
5915,Imperial Stout,3.55,l pours dark brunette forms a thick warm tan head fading slowly a nice layer of foam forms on top of the snifter held to the light this beer has a nearblack charcoal hue  s malt chocolate  t roasted malt hint of chocolate jam and a bit bready thin  f mediumbodied pretty light some carbonation crisp not similar to other imperial stouts  o imperial stout at 7 just about sums it up its not a bad beer per se but it follows the original english tradition which is to say lighter less body not as complex there are better stout options available
5916,Imperial Stout,2.34,i think this style of beer is just one i cant get into i can appreciate some of the flavors but the aftertaste is almost unbearable
5917,Imperial Stout,3.37,a pours up a deep reddish mahogany with a frothy threefinger beige head medium retention nice lacing  s immediate notes of chocolate followed my more muted hints of roasted malt specifically not coffee but roasted malt though some slight coffee notes do come out a little bit later as do some biscuity notes and some subtle hints of vanilla  t a warm bready sweetness greets you followed by a somewhat jammy malt flavor that hints at chocolate without quite getting there this is rounded out by some subtle hints of roasted malt and a crisp slightly tart finish  m on the lighter end of medium body slightly over carbonated and a bit dry  o this is a very good beer but to me it suffers from what i might call og syndrome what i mean by this is that how this style is understood has changed since this beer was first brewed but this beer largely has not leading to a beer that misses the mark by no fault of its own the beer has a surprisingly light body that one would not think of when one thinks of the style and the dryness and carbonation are unwelcome by modern standards as well i do enjoy this but were i reaching for an imperial stout this would not be my first choice its a bit too understated
5918,Imperial Stout,4.07,everything you would hope for in a classic british stout creamy light brown head that lasts until the end rich roasted barley mild hop aftertaste fermented in stone yorkshire squares what this adds to the flavor i cant say would drink this again at the drop of a hat
5919,Imperial Stout,4,i got what i paid for 5 for a biggie bottle of stout like going to the bunny ranch and sticking to the third tier of doves youre going to get one with a few feathers missing in life i suggest that you shouldnt lie to yourself you will be better off in the long run  or any run for that matter and with tonights realization for like the 50th time for me maybe ill make the better decision next time
5920,Imperial Stout,3.61,ljet black with a half finger head thats tan and dissipates to a rocky lace ssmells of faint roasted coffee toffee and chocolate on an even slighter note i get some dark stone fruit some soy sauce towards the end tfollows the nose a roasted malt flavor there but not much coffee some chocolate vanilla and brown sugar molasses slightly sweet slightly bitter as well some boozeyness at the end fmedium bodied mouthfeel decently high carbonation oehh i dont really get the hype with this beer its solid but there isnt anything to write home about for a surprisingly low abv imperial stout there was still a good bit of boozeyness on the pallet just an okay beer not sure if id try again
5921,Imperial Stout,4.18,12oz bottle into a pint glass coding no help in determining age  looks nice enough black body with a persistent tan head which leaves scattered lacing  aromas of dark chocolate and faint coffee  on tasting very smooth no roast slightly sweet with the coffee and chocolate notes detected by the nose  mouth full finish smooth and almost creamy  overall splendid stout would be happy to have ot again
5922,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.75,2016 vintagei think  a poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a small light tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing s smells of brandy barrels with some chocolate coffee and roasted malts t taste is chocolate and coffee up front with some brandy barrel influence hints of roasted malts and toasted marshmallows on the swallow theres more brandy barrel chocolate coffee and roasted malts m this beer has a body which is lighter than anticipated and slightly silky carbonation is quite low but it is there while the beer has a sightly drying finish due to the abv o overall this beer is quite good it has also held up well over time complexity also grows as the beer warms its definitely worth a try if you like barrel aged beers
5923,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.9,105 love it apple really come thru
5924,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.26,pours black with a finger of khaki foam head retention is good after an aggressive pour aroma is big apple brandy toffee barrel char and caramel dance and play over roasty and toasty malts flavor profile is mediumthin roasty and toasty malts lead the charge toffee caramel molasses and apple brandy tag on for a flavorful brew mouth feel is velvety and soft but never hits creamy it has a mediumthick consistency overall solid stout with hints of apple brandy coming through  reviewed from notes reviewed 11219 2018 version
5925,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.5,really enjoying this much less sweet than anticipated and has a nice chally bakers chocolage predominace the apple brandy tastes genuine and natural whereas i feel i lot of prairies beers are try hard and artificial namely vanilla noir which is awfully fake  its not terribly complex taste like a very simple basic strong old school ris with roasty notes layered with oak and yesz apple bransy quite thick and very hot
5926,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.79,this rating is based on the original from a few years ago pours dark brownblack with exceptional thickness the apple brandy melds perfectly to make this an exceptional barrel aged stout for a number of years this was my favorite beer
5927,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.58,i have never really been a fan of the apple brandy ba stouts the apple character has always been an odd mix for me i got this bottle for retail on the shelf mostly because i love prairie and i knew people flip for this beer upon opening it the smell is very distinct and i just dont like it it smells the way its supposed to smell its just that the apple brandy barrel of off putting to me now on the tongue its a completely different story for me the apple is there but distinct and really appealing a tiny bit tart the stouts sweetness works well with this barrel it also helps for it to be a bit warmer too a great beer that changed my mind ive never had a beer with a smell that i didnt like end up being enjoyable before so a really fun beer
5928,Oude Geuze Vintage,4.85,2016 edition from last year 375 ml bottle a little oak on the nose just enough carbonation to make the mouthfeel great taste makes me want to drink it all day
5929,Schaefer,2.26,this was once upon a time a fairly decent typical american beer you know its the kind of beer youd have at a picnic maybe mowing the lawn sitting on the front steps yapping with some buddies while having a cold one drinkable but in no way special well it seems a tad lesser quality than even back then very light yellow small short lasting head very light corn and barley taste dont blink youll miss the hops in a nutshell not a very good beer even at its inexpensive price of about 17 bucks a 30 pack better off with hamms or keystone light yep its that bad if you want some cheap brewskis
5930,Schaefer,2.86,not bad but nothing to write home about your value priced lawn mowing beer
5931,Schaefer,3.08,this isnt bad for an adjunct lager it looks like pss and smells similar has a corniness on the nose and a bright yellow color it tastes good though very smooth and not cloying cant beat it for 1749 a 30 pack
5932,Schaefer,2.48,310 ml can 105 oz label says puerto rico on it not sure why as the label also indicates it was brewed in milwaukee  drank on the beach in st john usvi so all that mattered was that it was wet and cold not much more to say very mild pale malt flavor thin and fizzy mouthfeel
5933,Schaefer,2.18,light refreshing for tinted water and very mild this thing drinks quick inoffensive and utterly forgettable there is nothing off here just simple light lager if youre hot and thirsty go for it
5934,Schaefer,2.53,a 12 oz can poured into a clear pint glass shows a very pale straw colored almost clear liquid theres very little head glass lacing nor aroma there is some taste but its mostly yeasty considering the category at least there is some taste this brand probably tasted better decades ago the puerto rican version definitely was
5935,Schaefer,3.22,mandatory discussion based on trying a few 6packs years in the past  schaefer was one of the brews available from regional brewers when i lived in madison wi from 197378 imo even that many years ago schaefer was not that popular bc there were too many other options available and the taste and smell were for diehard fans only  around 1977 or so miller lite came on the local scene and took a huge market away from the regional brews like schaefers
5936,Schaefer,4.47,the best aal on the market
5937,Schaefer,1.45,tastes like the metal bleachers of the stadium that used to bear its name literally any other beer would be better than this the one beer to have when youre having more than one no thanks ill have none
5938,Schaefer,2.75,drank a lot in college stole a lot from my dad 46 great session brew none of the floral i remember rather corny taste decent bitter ok for cheap beer
5939,Schaefer,4.94,i grew up in the 70s with all my family enjoying schaefer and it is still the favorite beer of my extended family great beer
5940,Schaefer,2.86,best by 72219  pours a golden straw topped with an ample thick white foam slowly receding retention leaves layers of splotchy lacing and a fading cap and collar  aromas show muddled grainy notes and some fresh straw with a minor corn sweetness almost overshadowed entirely by an oncoming presence of grassy hops bouquet has a quiet pop to it  taste lots of grain and a light honeyed sweetness throughout the profile while grassy hops come in late to give a rounded quality finishes quickly with hints of a somewhat unpleasant metallic tone lingering  mouthfeel holds a light body that holds nicely until the back end where it becomes a bit watery smooth carbonation with a progressive prickle on the palate and a decent crispness overall finish thins and fades quickly  solid essentially inoffensive aal with a developing grain character and reinforcing hoppy prickle somewhat inconsistent overall to be a goto but id have no problem returning to this one if the situation called for it
5941,Schaefer,2.25,another high school and college era beer was never the first second or even third choice but it was readily available and cheap again not the worst ive drank but easily closer to the bottom than the top
5942,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.5,wowbeen working my way through belgian alesonly drinking 90 here on beer advocatethis one was exceptionalreally enjoyed itexcellent trappist ale
5943,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.17,112 oz acclimated to 58f and poured into a goblet  pours a murky cedar brown with lighter flecks of sediment drifing around has a 1 finger foamy white head dissipating quickly and leaving a nice film of lacing  initial aroma is rum extract and general dried fruit primarily prune maybe chestnut or something else thats nutty also present is a sweet dairy smell combining with the rum extract smell i cant help but think it eggnog or custard a general christmas spice can be found as well as a hint of vanilla this is a lovely and inviting smell that immediately brings to britishchristmas desserts wonderful agitating conjures a creamy dairy aroma followed by that rum smell  initial taste before swallowing is peppery vaguely fruity and slightly sweet building into some alcohol burn after swallowing a mellow maltiness comes forward accompanied by a rum extract note and nutmeg notes quickly a sweetness builds joined afterwards by a moderate alcohol burn i pick up a note of bourbon vanilla further in in the exhale and aftertaste as well as brandy or whiskey or similar later the aftertaste remains mostly sweet and dried fruit flavored throughout the whole experience i couldnt shake the feeling i was drinking eggnog which personally i am largely in favor of  feel is creamy almost like drinking thin milk i find that it flows effortlessly the carbonation doesnt last unfortunately but otherwise the mouthfeel is very nice  overall superb the only gripe i have is that i found it a tiny bit lacking in flavor odd considering the alcohol content and i think the flavors present are magnificent but i yearn for just a smidge more otherwise theres nothing negative to say the whole experience was very enjoyable and i look forward to trying it again  will certainly buy again for special occasions just need to determine which of the 4 by the brewery is my favorite will absolutely recommend the 4 as well
5944,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.24,lovely molasses brown sweet raisin brown sugar great fresh feel lovely
5945,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4,delicious strong malts with subtle alcohol
5946,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.16,candied plums figs and rum soaked raisins smeared on top of fresh bready malts with some very mild hop bite and a peppery finish nice yeasty phenols dancing around throughout and hides the abv nicely but its there definitely delicious but honestly i remember it being better last time i had it a year or so ago
5947,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.39,tasted from a 300ml bottle into a globe glass  l  medium brown color with a touch of amber hazy strong fluffy light tan head made up of tightly packed tiny bubbles  s  inviting aromas are mostly maltbased giving dried fruits and a light nuttiness over that is a gentle herbal hops note and light yeast phenolics which give it a classic belgian flair  t  the flavors are gentle but keep going into great depths plums prunes raisins graham crackers and toast light cloves dill and a hint of black pepper  f  medium body gentle smooth carbonation medium hops bitterness that perfectly balances the malt sweetness alcohol is evident but is surprisingly light for the abv  o  this is a deep nuanced beer it is never inyourface but leaves a beautiful impression of craftsmanship and complexity only the slightly murky appearance hurts its score for me
5948,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.65,pours a nice dark amber red with a bone colored head smells of malt tastes very malty a muted bitterness at the start with an powerful rosin taste and dry feel the bitterness begins to bite after the fact no alcohol hidden here nice for what it is
5949,Arrogant Bastard Ale,2.56,i mistakenly pick this ale up from a pick six and realized that it wasnt a ipa which i am use to drinking needless to say not impressed at all the ale is overpowering with alcohol
5950,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.55,look pours a deep shade of amber with a generous three finger head of beige foam that has excellent retention and laces the glass very well no visible carbonation  aroma sticky toffee and caramel bitter grapefruit peel spruce needles and toasted orange peel a touch of sweetfunky guava  taste upfront treacle and sweet tamarind quickly transitions into moderately bitter notes of flamb√©ed orange and grapefruit peel ends on rich notes of bitter tree resin and spicy spruce needles  feel full bodied and velvety very low carbonation silky smooth and creamy alcoholic heat profile is very mild but somewhat detectable i wouldnt call it boozy but you can definitely tell its not a light weight beer  overall ive had this beer many many times but havent had it in a while its much better than i remember would highly recommend to anyone who likes their west coast ipas and hasnt tried it yet or any veterans who may have not had it in a long time definitely a world class imperial ipa  strong ale
5951,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.72,poured in standard pint glass nice ample fine sustained head very bitter slightly boozy when straight from the fridge did not enjoy had to walk away allowed to warm slightly but still cool had a more pleasurable experience prominent bitterness was accompanied by greater complexity of flavors including leather wet tobacco faint hint of dried fig wellsuited for a cool spring day postyard work  a beer i would prefer not to eat a meal with but rather enjoy on its own when in the mood for something strong and different never got to enjoy the barrel version with its name likely a victim of its own success but as with a once fantastic bottleconditioned bicycle beer it happens at least this beer still retains its general character and is not simply concerned with appeasing the easydrinking masses still memorable for a firsttimer not a goto by any means but will not hesitate to drink again on occasion
5952,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.04,i hadnt seen this in a while picked up a six pk on sale much more bitter  astringent than i remember will use the rest for beer bath bratwurst
5953,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.04,pours dark amber with ample tan head smells like toasty malts and bitter hops the taste is brawny bitter toasty herbal with some citrus and fig perhaps its kinda like a less fruity more bitter version of celebration bit i still like it and its pretty similar to what i remembered before cheers
5954,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.75,quite bitter but thats to be expected i suppose there is some balance with a nice maltiness but not enough balance for me i would prefer more malt flavor fortunately for me the hops arent too dank or piney which i dont enjoy  just a little bitter grapefruit
5955,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.25,poured into a tall clear pint glass appearance is a mahogany color with a thick foamy beige head good retention and lacing  aroma dark fruit caramel chocolate roasted malt roasted nuts  taste just like the aroma and very crisp and bitter which is a nice change from the typical lower ibu beers that ive had other notes of grapefruit toffee and maybe even coffee body is mediumlight
5956,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.27,compared to the original arrogant bastard this is a poor sequel the original had a strong malt backbone to balance the bitterness this incarnation has no malt to speak of its just another beer substituting ibus for flavor
5957,Oberon,3.7,nice refreshing summertime beer not going to knock your socks off but its a good crushable session beer good for the lake cookouts pool and tailgating
5958,Oberon,3.87,july 2023 hartwell nice can karen said it had a good head but she is not a beer drinker so we have to weigh that with a grain of salt a little bitter tasting overall its nothing thats knocking my socks off but i would certainly drink it over other things this is a pretty good review dont you think
5959,Oberon,3.99,lemon zest and some yeasty alcohol esters mouth feel is really where its at with a nice bite but still syrupy and not too heavy slight wheat and lemony taste with a slight floral hop
5960,Oberon,3.76,beautiful pourdeep yellow gold with a healthy white foam head muted notes of bread grassy wheat and light sweet floral notes tastes of malts wheat  slight phenolic sand a hint of sweetness great mouthfeelsilky smooth on the tongue with carbonation and little on the lower side of medium overall i am not a big wheat beer fan but i can drink this one and enjoy it
5961,Oberon,4.51,nothing better on a summer day
5962,Oberon,3.64,really good pale wheat here not my favorite style but this one is wellexecuted and enjoyable pours a cloudy pale orange ontap with a good layer of creamy lace more hoppy and citrusy than i expected nice malty wheat character in the creamy body with some spice characteristics and floral grassiness crisp finish overall nice
5963,Oberon,3.93,12 ounce cold can poured into a pint glass light gold with haze foam drizzles down quick aroma is wheaty malt with s pinch of lemon zest taste is of whole wheat bread with a tasty little lemony hop note well balanced mouth is medium full effervescent smooth lightly crisp and perfectly dry overall 4 ingredients made into a great american wheat ale nice
5964,Oberon,4,pours out of the can a slightly opaque strawgold with less than a finger of head smells yeasty floral slightly malty bready taste the malt initially and the floral wheat notes shine through really crisp mouthfeel that makes you want to take another drink soon
5965,Oberon,3.97,look turbid orange on the pour which excites a billowing white head to form and hold slowly relenting and leaving sheets of lacing behind aroma freshly baked wheat bread wheat malt wafts of citrus yeast and light phenolics taste wheat bread and a ton of it hit hard and fast up front as light citrus notes trickle in behind and join yeast jumps into the fray in the middle along with light herbal phenolics and wheat yeast and citrus intermingle throughout the close mouthfeel full silky smooth mediumhigh carbonation and soft and smooth on the finish overall i love this beer i was fortunate enough to try several bells beers years ago when they first tried breaking into the oregon market and always had a soft spot for this so was an easy purchase when i saw it locally again a classic american wheat with lots of tasty wheat character and not heavy on the traditional hefe yeast phenolics so an easy crowd pleaser i feel wellmade delicious and super crushable  what else do you need recommended
5966,Grey Monday,4.31,2021 vintage  im an absolute sucker for hazelnuts in a stout and when i see that the bruery has one its an instant buy plus its also another top 250 list tick this is a big ass bottle that ill likely be attacking all night so lets stop wasting time and get right into it  pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  right off the jump there isnt much hazelnut present in the nose but its still interesting nonetheless im picking up on aromas of molasses earthy bourbon peat smoke sea salt cocoa powder toasted hazelnut dry oak light vanilla and raisin  the hazelnuts definitely express a bit more in taste though they still arent exactly at the forefront on the front end of the sip im tasting cocoa powder earthy bourbon toasted hazelnut toasted oak black cherry burnt caramel vanilla sea salt and smoky tobacco the swallow brings notes of dark chocolate earthy bourbon toasted hazelnut sea salt peat smoke sea salt molasses dry oak burnt caramel and light vanilla  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick beer finishes mostly dry and drinks significantly below its abv like literally less than half and thats easily the most impressive part of this one  i struggle with this one its definitely not top 250 material and the adjunct isnt really the star but on the other hand its dangerously drinkable and pretty unique worth a shot for sure
5967,Grey Monday,4.2,750ml bottle 2021 edition sent to new society members under their new nationwide shipping policy very little difference from the base black tuesday if im honest having had regular bt many times but this being my first grey monday that means its excellent but the hazelnut treatment is pretty muted at this point if it was ever more prominent yielding a slight generic nuttiness with a touch of additional sweetness its not nutella thats for sure it also suffers the same shortcomings of the standard bt being very thin on mouthfeel for the ultrahigh abv and pretty hot on bourbon heat once it warms up a bit
5968,Grey Monday,3.76,pours a very dark brown though with moderate light clarity on the edges fizzy cola head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring nose has a hint of hazelnuts right off the bat before giving way to big waves of whiskey and rum molasses dark soy sauce barley oyster sauce and vanilla flavor is a little tough to place heat  both warming booze and sharp ethanol  pop right away theres significant salinity thats different from black tuesday  less deep blackstrap molasses more brackish sea spray or even oysters malts soy sauce black licorice are there but with less intensity than bt the nuts come forward as it warms and though its hard to definitively place hazelnuts they would be a guess along with peanuts and hazelnuts  definitely nothing too fatty like a walnut mouthfeel is remarkably thin for this kind of beer id call it moderate especially when compared to bt or a bcbs thats not bad per se but i think the feel contributes to the overall heat and sharpness this was interesting  though im not sure id be keen to shell out for another bottle
5969,Grey Monday,4.47,750 ml bottle bottled 053119 192 abv served in a snifter the beer pours dark brownblack with about an inch tan head that didnt stay around for too long not much lacing either i like the aroma the brew smells like bourbon vanilla fudge hazelnuts brown sugar and roasted malt taste is similar to the aroma but theres the addition of some burntcharred malt caramel and earthyoaky flavors its a little more roastybitter tasting than i was expecting but thats not a complaint by any means all the flavors seemed well balanced with no one flavor overpowering the others mouthfeelbody is full its slick and a bit rich with a moderate amount of carbonation and as with most of the bruerys big beers its not as boozy as youd expect it to be i thought this was a good overall imperial stout definitely worth trying if you get the chance
5970,Grey Monday,4.44,2013 and drank in 2022 look  black thick syrup smell  boozy maple barrel and hazelnut taste  boozy maple hazelnut barrel feel  medium full body slight syrup very light carb overall  tasty
5971,Grey Monday,4,2018 vintage the beer pours very little head and the beer itself is a dark brown color with a bourbon like appearance  the smell is good it has a nice mix of a sweet alcohol note and sweet hazelnut  the taste still has the hazelnut note but the chocolate is more forward and dominates the taste alongside the alcohol note  the feel is good it has a heavy body with very little carbonation and a slight burn at the end  overall a good beer worth getting and drinking fresh instead of holding it for a while
5972,Oktoberfest,3.54,this one was a bit disappointing to me this brewery is world class and maybe my expectations were high bc of that but honestly i prefer the sam adams oktoberfest to this one it seemed to be missing some of the toasted malty goodness that i notice in other fest beers but maybe my palate was off that day ill give it another shot sometime but it underwhelmed me a tad too light with the malt and lacking in depth of flavor
5973,Oktoberfest,3.64,pours a light copper color with a half finger of head the nose has mild bready notes the flavor is crisp and clean without the hearty maltiness that generally accompanies beers of this style the body is light for the style as well
5974,Oktoberfest,4.09,appearance pours a clear medium amber color moderate white head srm of 13 425  aroma moderate aromas of white bread crackers yeast some hints of honey 400  flavor moderate flavors of pale malt crackers smooth bread some toasted bread flower and honey mildly sweet dry finish 400  feel mediumbodied excellent carbonation smooth finish 425  compared to fair state festbier 92023 pours darker milder aromas more amber notes and smooth clean mouthfeel less rich toasted sweet  overall toppling goliath has a pretty good m√§rzen amber toasted with mild flavors this one is subtle but excellent rich bread lightly toasted the aromas and flavors wont impress you initially but how they subtly linger off the smooth mouthfeel is what makes this one good often m√§rzens are too heavy boozy and cloyingly sweet this is crisp dry clean and drinkable excellent stuff rating 409
5975,Oktoberfest,3.95,nice marzen good caramel sweetness and breast malts lots of bitter zesty hops for the style clear brown amber color with no head retention

5977,Oktoberfest,3,can  high c  average
5978,Oktoberfest,3.63,im a huge oktoberfest fan and i really look forward to this time of year when i was walking through the beer store today i was looking for a sam adam but its not out yet so looking around they had a few and i wanted to try something new so i grab this one over bells i liked the beer but i dont think its its an oktoberfest its just doesnt have that malt feel and its a little thin solid lager but not what i was looking for today
5979,Oktoberfest,3.39,from a 16 oz can packed on 71123 consumed on 81223  clear pouring beer from the can and copper colored when i hold it to the light i see a few carbonation bubbles rising in the glass the head that formed was minimal less than one finger and off white the head isnt long lasting and theres no lacing on the glass as it dissipates to a ring around the glass the aroma is just screaming biscuit and uncooked bread to me so malty notes of caramel also hit my nose but faint taste  the flavor isnt as malty as i was expecting from the aroma it seems somewhat crisp up front with more of the malts on the back they just dont jump out as much as i expected theres actually more hops than i expect from this styler and they produce a bitterness on the back that just doesnt seem to work for the style the body is decent for the style not too sure about this one its not bad tasting though the hop bitterness that im getting just doesnt seem right for the style
5980,Oktoberfest,3.94,pours a beautiful clear golden copper with a thick ivory head that leaves spotty lacing aroma is caramel malt rye bread and some floral hops flavor follows the nose sweet up front with minimal floral hops in the finish feel is medium bodied with ample carbonation overall another nice beer from these folks
5981,Oktoberfest,4,16oz can date stamp on can bottom is pkg071123 mostly clear deep gold colored body two fingers of dirty white head this transforms to a scuzzy cap and ring leaves behind partial webs of lacing aroma is very much of bread seems to be a mix of sourdough sweet bread and dark bread taste is quite sweet but very malty toasted bread sourdough home made whole grain bread and dark bread has a touch of floral hops all continue into the aftertaste full mouth feel clean and crisp finish good carbonation lots of bread flavors and an easy to drink feel a meal in a can

5984,Sunday Brunch,4.71,deep dark black head was not as dark as i guessed it would be more of an off white color strangely the nose is cinnamon at first but after first taste then the nose was more coffee taste was cinnamon coffee with a smooth finish not bitter all smooth great porter
5985,Sunday Brunch,3.69,20220206 500ml bottle served in a footed pilsner glass 2021 vintage received from the glorious jonphisher  pours very dark brown with a small head that fades slowly to an almost invisible skin and a small ring around the glass smell is chocolate and cinnamon  taste is cinnamon first and all else second milk chocolate is definitely there some coffee bitterness might be a hint of syrupy sweetness  mouthfeel is medium tending toward thick overall this is a good beer but too much cinnamon for me but im a little oversensitive to cinnamon in beer
5986,Sunday Brunch,4.85,pours black with a light brown solid head super coffee roast aroma very pungent taste is heavy coffee as well with a lot of maple sweetness the cinnamon comes through strong as well thick mouthfeel carbonation was a little lacking which is pretty much the only flaw in this excellent beer

5991,Dinner,4.51,poured on tap a snifter at churchkey dc  beaming pale gold with hints of orange color and some fine carbonation soft creamy top of finger presented with an off white appearance and bowled tilted lacing  aroma is a wonderful spiced orange juiced christmas mandarin nose with hints of spice and leafy green sensing hops soft bodied and creamy vanilla sensing malt to match make an impressive hop nose  palate is richly good but no surprises creamy sensing body along with the flavors if anything its mouthfeel is the most impressive mid palate rich in peeled and juiced orange tangerine notes finish accentuates soft green herbs to an almost minty finish but a more pungent flavor and sharper astringency like a soft pine still manages great balance keeping soft vanilla like flavored sweetness and that classic creamsicle orange like flavor  its not that exotic or dynamic just a solid ipa done with exceptional base flavors very nice
5992,Dinner,4.84,so happy to finally try this historic ipa  mango pineapple and a slightly dank herbaceous quality on the nose palate is sharp and clean with pine hints of green onion and overripe oranges mildly sweet malt undertones balance the profile finishes clean and lightly bitter superb

5994,Dinner,4.24,169 oz bottle 64 18apr23 purchased cold from the brewery yesterday poured into my trillium fat tulip  l pale yellowamber liquid slight haze beautifully rocky sponge of white foam the head holds for a bit but settles into a messy but steady cap though it doesnt lace much  s pineapple green onion tropical taffy undercurrent of orange peel hint of pool liner vinyl perhaps a subtle clean singe of ethanol vibrant and eyeopening sweaty later  t triple sec zip up front getting lost behind the peppery spice of booze and grapefruity hop with an orangeyinfused cereal malt drenching the palate floor all followed by a subtle swell of florality that followed by more cereal grain all while the pungent peppery electric hop swizzle stings the roof of my mouth as it goes and maybe the palate becomes too stunned the flavors relax into an obscured obfuscated blend of pina colada and orange blossom water moderate bitterness most apparent way after the last sip longest lingering flavor artefact  f lightbodied nearing thin too attenuated lacking supporting hop resins relatively pointed and punchy booze the levity is excellent but im craving more luscious sticky leavings considering its exposed potency  o visited maine beer for the first time yesterday and wow are their beers far superior out of the bottle vs draft draft pours too cold muting flavors which were muddy anyway the draft pour of this had little impact on my memory im guessing rhetorically its limited availability has resulted in high marks they make solid beers and this is no different in its construct but its lack of depth is a disappointment 2115
5995,Dinner,4.5,beautiful hop bomb grab this one soon as you see it
5996,Burleigh Bighead,2.58,bottle comped to me on the street dont ask  c  below average
5997,Burleigh Bighead,2.77,from bottle clear pale gold no head and flat looking aroma mixes wet cardboard with grainy malt light body and lightly fizzy worth a try on a hot day
5998,Burleigh Bighead,1.76,this beer is a no carb beer it is very weak in colour reminding me of your standard american beer rather than an australian beer however the taste is not totally watery i would still rather drink this than budweiser
5999,Burleigh Bighead,3.25,not much flavour watery but a thirst quencher on a hot day and session able
6000,Burleigh Bighead,2.11,straw yellow color no head retention very light smell of fruits crispy taste is slightly grainy and slighlty sour semidry finish watery feeling very low body
6001,Burleigh Bighead,1.48,bottle has a child with an enormous head on it enough said  appearance considering this is a nocarb beer not too bad that said it looks a bit weak and flat with a bubbling head that dissipates too quickly  aroma very little in the way of aroma what vague whiff is apparent is standard grains quite dull  taste i dont really see the point of beers like this breweries have to understand that if a beer has almost no flavour the only flavour that will come through is an awful skunky offmetal grain mighty unimpressive  aftertaste disappears quickly thank god still thats half the problem  there isnt that much flavour to begin with  mouth feel thin and watery with limited carbonation just keeps getting better  overall a pointless and hatefully awful beer from a brewer that ought to know better with their range of fantastic beers this is a truly awful deviation from the norm add to that the fact that it is the price of standard fullstrength it is actually quite insulting if you want a beer buy one if you really want a decent boutique light get a rogers beer if you just want a reasonable light lager go for your standard macro white stag xxxx gold cascade light etc i can assure you they are much much better value and taste a whole lot better rant over
6002,Burleigh Bighead,1.61,tobeerornottobe said do you have a lighter beer oh yes i sure do  pours very clear and very light with minimal body and a filmy pure white head lacing is relatively persistent and leaves a pleasant frothy pattern down the inside of the glass no its not a brilliant looking beer but its very decent for the style  nose is crisp and adjuncty with a note of corn or dms and a slightly sharper ialmostwanttocallithoppiness but then it sinks back to sweet corn syrup and light vomitous astringency no not for me  taste is almost devoid of character even feelingits as though this beer disappears as soon as you put it in your mouth very thin and only leaving a hint of that corn because it has to really reminiscent of a wet tortilla appalling  really horrible beer of the kind that makes you scream out in disgust as to why it was ever brewed no carb beer it should be illegal
6003,Morning Wood,4.47,2017 vintage  beer 1400 i purposely saved this one for this landmark review since i reviewed the base version and the imperial version a few weeks back this has been a long time want of mine and luckily i was able to get the whole series at once this bourbon barrelaged variant has been sitting at the highest rated imperial porter for a long time on ba and 38 overall lets see if it lives up to the hype  pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy dark tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  the bourbon is definitely present in the nose making the whole thing quite a bit sweeter but still really good im picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon charred oak salty bacon medium roast coffee milk chocolate maple syrup burnt caramel and light brown sugar  its an absolute smack in the face of every single element in taste wow on the front end of the sip im tasting smoky bacon milk chocolate maple candy sweetened coffee sweet bourbon raisin toasted oak creamy vanilla and caramel the swallow brings notes of salty bacon charred oak dark chocolate medium roast coffee burnt caramel brown sugar maple syrup smoked malt and vanilla  a medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a smooth and silky beer finishes mostly dry with a warming alcohol presence  man its been so much fun trying my way through this series this one is the clear winner i hope i get a chance to try them all fresh one day
6004,Morning Wood,4.59,22oz bomber bottle most likely a 2019 bomber based on the listed abv of 11 on the bottle but was told this was a 2018 vintage of morning wood  poured into durobar charente glass  appearance black bodied beer with dense and thick off white to light brown head that is uneven with lots of large soapy looking bubbles light lacing good staying power thick ring remains around the outside of the glass as the head eventually dies down  smell big maple and oatmeal with a hint of cinnamon smokey bacon and a hint of coffee hints of chocolate oak and bourbon  taste immediately big maple syrup flavored oatmeal just like what was found in the nose bacon and meaty smoke integrated nicely with a gentle ashy barrel char in the middle that is quite enjoyable hint of dads brand root beer candies and cola finish has lots of rich bourbon notes and chocolate notes this is complex superbly balanced and flat out really really tasty easily exceeds my expectations for sure  mouthfeel medium bodied beer with low and adequate carbonation levels slightly silky and creamy bodied porter very smooth and not any booze at all  overall finally pretty excited to get to tick this barrel aged porter thanks to taturbo this beer is rich without being overly sweet the barrel notes are spot on and it really is hard to find anything wrong in this beer just the right amount of maple which is a flavor that is easy to overdo the balance is also quite impressive as well put this beer on your must try list if you havent breakfast flavors galore with a splash of bourbon and oak whats not to like the barrel aging definitely improves maple bacon coffee porter which is a hard feat to achieve nice work here from funky buddha for sure
6005,Morning Wood,4.53,damn the minute i opened this i was punched in the face with maple  it is clear that age has not diminished the maple presence at all  in terms of appearance it pours a shiny black color a lovely velvety head forms on the beer with solid head retention it is pretty viscous back to the aroma  it is dominated by the maple syrup with underlying notes of smoky bacon oak bourbon and chocolate all of those aromas are quite strong  so i am not really getting much in the way of coffee  taste follows the nose and is very much dominated by the maple syrup flavor but the surprising part is that it is not at all as sweet as i remember from having this in the past there is much more roasted malt chocolate smoked malts with some slight meaty notes and the bourbon barrel comes through more strongly some slight roasty bitterness comes through on the back end feel is thick full bodied and luscious moderate carbonation sort of drier on the finish

6020,Iris,4.33,appearance  the beer poured a hazy shade of amber his a huge bubbly white head this beer could not wait to get out of the bottle  smell  the nose was like a rustic dry sour presence with a definite green apple presence  taste  the profile was pleasantly earthy it initially had a floral quality that brought to mind herbal tea also included were notes of oak lime and green apples the sour notes were steady not screaming for attention or melting dental fixtures the beer had a nice dry finish  mouthfeel  after the head finished rising the carbonation was only moderately intense  overall  this was a solid lambic though not necessarily one i would seek again
6021,Iris,4.33,2021 bottling medium amber in the glass with some haziness and a finger of dense offwhite head that retains fairly well and leaves minimal lacing the maltiness here is quite unique indeed almost like a flanders red  getting some toastiness and cherry pie notes in the aromas and flavors moderately acetic with a fluffy and lively effervescence the hops impart a lightly bitter herbal flavor but its not too overwhelming and compliments the oaky barrel character happy new year  87100

6036,Bud Light Lime Cran-Brrr-Rita,4.62,cranberrita has a thin fizzingaway pink head a semiopaque magenta appearance bubbles and no glass lacing the aroma is of cranberry cocktail and the flavor is the same with tartness and no bitterness there is sweetness and perhaps pale malt mouthfeel is high medium and cranberrita finishes mainly dry  rjt
6037,Bud Light Lime Cran-Brrr-Rita,2.66,aroma is slightly artificialfunky cranberries and a good hint of sweetness the flavor is similar to the arom with the artificialfunky cranberries being overpowering with a sweet finish
6038,Bud Light Lime Cran-Brrr-Rita,2.17,50 cent 8 oz can out of the bargain basket  pours a cranberry jelly color with a diminished head that rivals the length of seeing a shooting star 80 opaque  aromas of margarita mix and lime salt a touch of ocean spray and 7 up  quite strong on the alcoholic presence with a shortlived antisepticlike throat spray flavor that fades to a more fruity light cranberry cocktail juice taste the alcohol is felt almost immediately in the tummy and the carbonation stings the tongue finish has the ripe bitterness of cranberries which may be the only thing genuine here ugly dryness rivaling sore throat on the finish which actually walks in tandem with the throat spray flavor  overall the cranbrrrita is a nice attempt but falls short just as all the other beers in this line do too much antiseptic only to be covered up by pure sugar and some artificial cranberry additive  im giving it a 2 overall which actually feels somewhat generous
6039,Bud Light Lime Cran-Brrr-Rita,3.65,as most other reviewers are stating you almost cant rate these rita products as beer however if this was brought to me in a glass and i was told it was a cooler i would be fairly impressed juicy somewhat artificial cranberry flavour no detection of the 8 abv ive made the mistake of having 4 of these in a night the hangover was far and away worse than what it would have been if id consumed the equivalent amount of alcohol in good beer so be wary of drinking multiple all in all this is a serviceable summer beverage
6040,Bud Light Lime Cran-Brrr-Rita,3.32,first off i want to say i only like this drink because it doesnt taste like beer at all more like juice or punch  l4 this drink looks good not good as a beer but good as a drink pink like cranberry juice with a small quickly receding head s375 again smells like juice no alcohol hops malt or anything beerlike to be detected smells very sweet with some slight bitterness from the cranberry t tastes exactly like juice or hawaiian punch i cant taste anything resembling beer in this beverage very slight alcohol taste goes down fast f275 its carbonated like a beer but the feel of the juice seems too thick to go with it kinda lingers in the mouth slightly syrupy and sticky o3 its not a bad drink but i dont think its really a beer at all despite the fact its a malt beverage id drink it if i was in the mood and was offered but probably wouldnt ever seek it out worth trying if you like juice or wine coolers
6041,Becks's Vier,2.84,pint at the hampton inn bristol airport clear golden pour almost flat aroma is sweet weak grainy notes not much to the taste either weak bready notes light on the palate all around clean weak but not horrible kind of pleasant
6042,Becks's Vier,2.77,on tap at the last post guernsey in august 2014 abv is 4 pale golden colour moderate white head some grassy notes in the aroma fairly bland flavour but crisp and dry and unoffensive a little hops in the finish
6043,Becks's Vier,1.88,straw colour with a small head that disappears quickly and leaves minimal spotty lacing grainy smell tastes over sweet with no hops or malt chemically and metallic smooth mouthfeel with a chemical tang bland beyond words pointless
6044,Becks's Vier,3.75,
6045,Becks's Vier,1.95,275ml bottle from morrisons supermarker glasgow light amber to golden a 1cm bubbly white head that disappeared completely after 20 seconds  very light with some corn  skunk there was some adjuncts as well  faint grassy hops some bitterness comes through but like the rest this is light as well bordering on weak  grassy hops  a light bitterness there was faint skunk  a few lager type malts  adjuncts a bland  weak tasting beer that didnt taste great at all  light bodied with a grainy feel to it particularly towards the end of the beer  some chewy patches throughout the body was very light  watery with some faint bitterness  slightly above average carbonation  a fairly poor beer from becks although to be honest i wasnt really expecting much more for it in truth the beer was far too weak  light which made it a drag to work my way down it wasnt even good for a macro pale lager either  its not one ill be picking up again
6046,Becks's Vier,2.7,on 28th nov 13 i had a little lagerpilsner session and started off with a side by side becks v becks vier both beers were poured into veltin badged stemmed tulips the vier came in a green 275ml bottle part of a pack my son will get the rest of them  the vier looked identical to the original becks in every way golden clear bright and clean looking the heads the same white unlasting wisp so many in this style of beer seem to have  this beer however was slightly sweeter and had less body depth than the stronger normal becks saccharine came to mind with the sweetness  overall it was ok grainy and a little too sweet for a good lager but nothing really bad or good about it
6047,Blushing Monk,4.02,drank a 2015 in 2023 look  dark burgandy with a pinkish tan thick head smell and taste  nice tark milk raspberry feel  medium body slightly creamy overall  aged well
6048,Blushing Monk,4.39,drinking a 4 12 year old bottle of it and it is still damn good still has carbonation and there is plenty of fruit flavor and bite to it the alcohol is disguised extremely well an excellent example of the style have to see if i can get some more of it one day
6049,Blushing Monk,3.74,12oz bottle served in a tulip glass bottled on 112420 17202 i just bought this and i can see why it got lost on the shelves its a white date stamp on a pale offwhite label not real smart lets hope im not about to regret my life choices with a really old beer  appearance hazymurky copperred color with a thin white head that died back a few islands of lacing here and there sadly not the best looking beer  smell definite raspberry note a little bit of underlying yeastiness and some funk as well starting to wonder if 2 years after bottling this is taking on some lambic character  taste so not a lambic  its not that tartsour definite raspberry note with some underlying aspects of a belgian tripel herbal leafy hop note some muted belgian yeast character i feel like the belgian character may be somewhat lost here  mouthfeel good thickness quite sticky and somewhat juicelike light carbonation still  it held its carbonation this long  overall  drinkability for a beer that is over 2 years oldits still got some of its original character but the belgian character is mostly swamped out from the raspberry that still dominates this far on so for an unexpected cellared beer its okay i will see if i can score a fresh bottle and try it again  but note to the brewer use a laser  ink system that puts a black date stamp onto a white label
6050,Blushing Monk,3.78,pours a clear light pink color smell has raspberry vanilla yeast and vanilla  taste flows nose with raspberry front  followed by melon vanilla and stone fruits   mouth feel sweet with some yeast funk slight tartness 
6051,Blushing Monk,4.37,its clear and the color of pink grapefruit the raspberry smell is very evident and pleasant taste more like a cider than a beer the raspberry comes through strong and at first its sweetness is immediately up front but followed by a sour on the finish gives the flavor a beautiful experience make sure you coat your entire tongue this hits so many different taste buds nice
6052,Blushing Monk,4.17,pours rose with a 1 light pink head which lasts moderate lacing  aroma is floral raspberry belgian yeast  taste is wine like raspberries belgian yeast sweet  medium body lively carbonation sweet finish  an interesting take on a beer
6053,Blushing Monk,4.39,bottled on 11232020 drank on 532022 so may need to revisit this when i try a fresh one but for those of you curious about how it held up read on poured reddish amber deeply hued and sported a manila colored 1 cm head for a minute or two leaving behind a thin ring which left regular lacing the aroma is still all about the raspberries but there is a secondary note in there that reminds me of all things angel food cake hmmmm the flavor starts out strong with raspberry but later mellows to a semi sweet malty ale that is sheer pleasure to drink the angel food cake shows up in the flavor as well very curious and very tasty the feel took me back a bit far more viscous than expected but thats likely on me this is a fruited strong belgian ale and a little viscosity isnt misplaced just unexpected maybe fresh the carbonation balances it out more oa so glad the released this again sorry i picked an old one to rate it with but once its open ya drink it
6054,Blushing Monk,5,absolutely love it hopefully it turns into a year round production
6055,Blushing Monk,3.66,this is a very very berry beerappearance sip scent all scream berry bomb enjoyed on tap at the source after trying it in the wild for a number of years
6056,Blushing Monk,4.12,very red in color  plenty of raspberries in the nose  raspberry with a bit of yeast and tartness  medium thick mouthfeel  pretty similar to ng raspberry tart in my recollection nice change of pace but nothing you can drink a gallon of
6057,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.41,purchased a 2023 bottling in 2023 poured at cellar temperature into a wine glass as my goblet did not survive a move  vigorous head on pour half filled my glass with fluffy offwhite foam like a wellmade cappuccino excellent retention and it took a long time to settle enough to pour a proper glass beer is a ruddy brown with tawny highlights some haze and fine carbonation  immediate malt on opening like walking into a bakery warm whole grain type bread putting my nose into the glass my impression is of balance its subtle and difficult to pull out specific notes but i get cherry a bit of almond orange peel and a light mineral aspect the expected regional notes of banana and clove are present but subdued  taste is the expected clove and banana plus brown sugar cardamom cream back notes of coffee beans and mineral water  mouthfeel starts out with a spritelike effervescence calming to a velvety creamy texture from the head  drinkability yeah its drinkable if you can get ahold of enough of it to have a session sure you could do it but after only one bottle i can already tell im starting to miss subtleties that i picked up at the beginning much more affordable beers to tie one off with but for any beer advocate this is a bucket list item worth checking off the list
6058,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.88,pours dark amber into a snifter very thin and white head which mostly disappears with a slight film left throughout the consumption smell is complex fruits spice a bit of malt combine for a wonderful aroma slight alcohol vapor helps bring the scents up and out into the air mouth feel again complex 102 abv is there but no alcohol burn  smooth with the spice and fruit finishing without very little aftertaste overall a truly world class beer
6059,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),5,the hype is real
6060,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.75,smooth taste of caramel with nutty notes in the aroma amber color with a white head well balanced fullbodied with a pleasant lingering aftertaste
6061,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.17,drank this is a belgian beer cafe in warsaw old town a few years ago so reviewing from memory it was definitely kind of expensive but not as expensive as i was expecting on a cold snowy lonely nightit seemed the perfect idea  it definitely looks as beautiful as any beer i have seen deep dark and mystical and i remember the aromas being similardeep and mysticaland complex  i remember it being mega smooth my initial impression was that this is much better than rochefort 8 and 10 much much better as i have never been a fan of either this has much more complexity and is less creamyand kind of dark and full of different flavour sensations that are difficult to put into words however as i am reviewing from memory i will need to review again when i actually have one with me when i am writing  so yes this is kind of a vague review but i dont remember liking it more than a mega amazing west coast ipa or even a chouffe ipa it was kind of like a chimay bleu but wth much more complexity so these ratings are my approximated memories ciao
6062,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.61,bottle courtesy of rub_this_bbq actually drank this about a year ago with two friends i was sharing bottles with we did a sidebyside with st bernardus abt 12 long my favorite quad although ive left alone my ridiculous scoring of that one from around 20yrs ago as it was an amazing experience for me at the time this actually was the superior beer i just score a lot more realistically these days compared to when i was a noob and whose mind had just been blown by my first quadrupel ale
6063,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.75,got a chance to try this in amsterdam from a bar that has a guy drive into belgium every three weeks to pick up a case from various trappist breweries the praise for this beer is wellearned probably the finest beer i have ever had and certainly the best quad even better than my beloved abt 12 there is nothing at fault with it it is a lovely experience i hope i have a chance to try it again one day
6064,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.94,such an amazing beer the westy is the unicorn of beers i bought 48 bottles 2 crates at the abbey in dec 2017 still have about 15 bottles left its been interesting experiencing them age over time they are still drinking well but imho i think they peaked after about 3 years i did a side by side tasting party in 2019 including beers from all 6 belgian trappist ales westmalle dubbel chimay bleue rochefort 10 orval achel brune westvleteren 12st sixtus abbey and others st bernardus 12 leffe brune la trappe quad many of these are excellent but the westy 12 was head and shoulders above the rest in terms of overall complexity and quality i agree with many of the tasting notes posted before and i wouldnt do it justice to try but i will say if you enjoy the strong quad style do yourself a favor and try one  obtw i had to call and hit about 500 busy tones before finally getting through to a monk and placing my order in 2017 and i had to go in person to the abbey to pick them up i believe they now have a website that you can order for delivery check their calendar for times and details
6065,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),5,had at the bar next to the abbey where is is made absolutely incredible the smell is absolutely amazing predominantly figs dates and aged leather the taste is is even better smooth with complex layers of fig chocolate and other malted notes honestly one of the best beers ive ever had im feel lucky to be able to take home a few of them
6066,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.24,trappist westvleteren 12 from brouwerij westvleteren 105 oz bottle received from superspak about a million nbs bifs ago  thanks ian reviewed 050323 review 3058 note that i use ddmmyy protocol stamped on cap 241015 served at 534 degrees in a hand washed and dried tripel karmeliet chalice the final temperature was 597 degrees appearance  35 first pour deep amber srm 15 clear body  amber brown srm 18 opaque under direct light same coloration but loaded with precipitate and suspended particles when rear lite opaque except amber at the edges head  average maximum 15 cm aggressive center pour almond high density and fizzy receding to neither crown nor cap just an intermittent bubble ring lacing  none aroma  45  roasted malt dates and figs sweet candi sugar no yeast no hops no ethanol 102  abv as marked on cap aroma flavor  45  roasted malt dark fruity slightly sweet no hops no yeast weak gastric warming no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl palate  35  medium lightly creamy initially thins as it warms lively carbonation final impression and summation 4 not bad but maybe cellared a bit too long the aroma and flavor are fine but the appearance and body have suffered
6067,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.41,best by 2014 month has worn away so bottled in 2011 a kind gift from my sisterinlaw poured from a 330ml bottle into my westvleteren chalice 102 abv served at 55f  chestnutburnt umber liquid with coppercaramel highlights and a small beige cap receding quickly to a lasting collar adequate retention fine lacing delicate yet viscous legs  lovely rich maltyestery aromatics suggest plum fig date toffee and an old european cobblers shop weighty yet perfectly integrated and inviting no perceptible oxidation  flavor follows the nose but is joined by a low earthy bitterness and some suggestions of brandy and eucalyptus long linear mediumdry finish rounded and rich with some complex stewed fruit elements  modest carbonation but holding up well given the age slightly thin and quite warming  more than the sum of its parts and still a top tier example of the style though i look forward to updating this review one day with a fresh bottle
6068,P√©ch√© Mortel,4.27,understated smooth a bit of chocolate and char roast malts coffee very well rounded and tastes great without a bunch of adjuncts
6069,P√©ch√© Mortel,3.49,115oz bottle purchased at community pint in spokane wa according to the stamp on the rear level this was bottled on february 23 2022 different label than what is shown here  poured into a snifter this was the color of darkest night with a thin tan head that did not stick around for very long  nose was initially of coffee and molasses as it warmed there was an aroma similar to cinnamon that stepped up to the plate  very understated vaguely coffeeish and cinnamon flavor but the coffee was really quite muted apart from that just a vaguely roasty malt flavor was present bitter coffee flavor at the swallow  fairly light bodied for an imperial stout kinda watery really  im not a fan maybe this is too old maybe it was abused by whatever distributor brought it to community pint im familiar enough with them to know they store beer well but i also recall the two other beers ive had from dieu du ciel also turned out similarly when i got a chance to try them maybe im just not on their wavelength or theyre not on mine i think im done trying their beers short of actually going to montreal and trying them at the source disappointing
6070,P√©ch√© Mortel,4.21,finally got to try this top ranked beer in canada does it live up to its rep lets find outthe pour is indeed thick and black with a coffee collar that stayed for a bit nose is coffee roasted goodness with chocolate underlay taste is similar with roasted coffee upfront and boozy finish feel is light surprisingly not as much body as i was expecting look its good but do think some brewers in canada have come up with comparables rorshach comes to mind as does flying monkeys attempts and third moon this one has been around for ages and so its reputation has built but i do feel ontario can now match its prowess
6071,P√©ch√© Mortel,4.33,one year old can to snifter  l pours pitch black with a light brown head that leaves a bit of lacing a couple of very fine floaters visible  s coffee cocoa dark chocolate and vanilla dark and smoky with some sweet hints  t dark and malty with notes of coffee and dark chocolate complemented by some smoky hints minimal sweetness very bitter  f smooth and creamy on the one side rather light bodied and drinkable on the other side medium carbonation  o very good nobullshit coffee stout with a classic flavor profile drinks very smoothly but could be a bit thicker works great even without any barrel aging
6072,P√©ch√© Mortel,4.35,pours a dark brownblack with a 1f tan head and moderate lacing  smells of coffee chocolate and caramel  tastes of toasted malt dark chocolate mildly bitter coffee  caramel and vanilla with a mildly bitter boozy warm finish  medium heavy body with light carbonation lush syrupy mouthfeel  this is a well made very strong and complex sipper its at its most bitter just out of the refrigerator and gets sweeter and mellower as it warms
6073,P√©ch√© Mortel,4.34,bottled on 20160111 1214lot114
6074,P√©ch√© Mortel,3.98,115oz can received as a gift from a friend batch number 69 i emailed the brewery to ask when this was bottled they said approximately 20131017 so this beer is almost 9 12 years old interesting and surprising fact  this is a screwoff bottle cap  look this beer is quite dark black with brown highlights but doesnt appear to be so thick there is a very thin tancolored head around the rim of the glass  smell nice roasted malt coffee and chocolate aromas a bit of fruitiness and lots of booze slightly reminiscent of chocolate covered cherry cordials  taste its tasty for me this has the right amount of sweetness and bitterness up front its very roasty and a bit fruity somewhat sweet the finish is initially mildly sweet and then gradually shifts to a fullon bitter chocolatey and coffeeladen finish  feel its on the thin side for an imperial stout i would call this medium bodied or perhaps medium plus appropriately carbonated  not too much carbonation and not too little either as i take my time to sip on this its not nearly as enjoyable as it loses its carbonation  overall its a very solid coffee imperial stout i had this beer once before either at a bottle share or at home over 15 years ago i remember being extremely impressed with it then im not so taken with this beer now im not sure if its because this bottle has a lot of age on it or because the bar has been raised for coffee stouts and craft beer in general over time i think that this is not getting a fair shake due to age either way this aged bottle is good not amazing in my opinion then again my review needs to be taken in consideration given that this bottle is old and that a fresh bottle will undoubtedly taste different and probably a lot better
6075,P√©ch√© Mortel,4.44,115oz bottle bottled date 20210812 consumed on 17 feb 2023 glass snifter abv 95  serving temp room temp   look thick black with a 1finger creamy light brown head the head is slow to dissipate and leaves awesome lacing along the glass  smell lightly sweetened medium to light roast coffee bittersweet chocolate notes of vanilla and a touch of oak the vanilla makes the brew smell like it has some cream or more accurately creamer good creamer in it a faint wisp of smoke can be detected if one tries  taste wonderfully balanced sweetened mediumroast coffee with a touch of cream and bittersweet chocolate a nice earthy bitterness is present but is part of the coffee and does not overwhelm the sip finishes spicy a bit bitter but also a touch sweet smokiness shows up in the aftertaste  feel smooth and viscous some late warmth from the alcohol the body is medium with a step to the thin side  overall an excellent imperial coffee stout nicely complex very tasty and surprisingly drinkable the only knock to the brew is its thinnerthanexpected body but thats my issue not the beers  if you like coffee andor coffee stouts pick this up and give it a try
6076,P√©ch√© Mortel,5,to be fair ive been drinking peche mortel for about 12 years over the years ive had some great beers but this is the only one im willing to buy online to make sure i have it readily in stock it pours nearly black with a half finger of creamy hazelnutcolored head the smell lets you know what kind of a ride you are about to enjoy a punch of roasted coffee comes first followed by dark chocolate dark fruits leather and tobacco smoke the taste follows the nose with each aspect getting to shine as the beer warms coffee roast dark chocolate are front and center with some subtle dark fruitiness giving way to a leather and ash finish all are well balanced the mouthfeel is creamy with a moderate carbonation but isnt overly boozy for 95 abv to this day the best beer ive ever had
6077,P√©ch√© Mortel,4.2,115oz bottle into a pint glass bottled 32015 so 7 years old  black body small tan head doesnt last long but leaves a light spiders web of lacing  aroma is nicely of coffee  on tasting strong coffee flavor smooth lightly sweet some warmth from the abv  mouth above medium finish coffee with a faint roasted malt  overall impressed that 7 years in the bottle doesnt diminish the coffee unless a fresh one is an outright coffee bomb
6078,P√©ch√© Mortel,3.99,2015 vintage growler into pint glass pours essentially black with no head initial impression is roasted malts dark choclate and coffee grounds mouthfeel is medium  thinner than i like for a stout finish fades to a smokycoffee bitterness overall an interesting and truetostyle imperial stout
6079,P√©ch√© Mortel,4.5,solid black appearance with a thin tan head has light carbonation thick heavy feel to the body aroma is a deep rich smokeychar dark bakers chocolate coffee grinds taste has a harsh but pleasant coffee bitterness dry dark chocolate roasted malt with some smokey wood overall an excellent beer
6080,P√©ch√© Mortel,3.5,light stout slightly creamy but nothing else
6081,P√©ch√© Mortel,3.75,poured nicely very noticeable coffee smell too much doesnt taste like beer with coffee tastes like coffee with carbonation overpowering not to my liking
6082,P√©ch√© Mortel,4.44,a magnificent stout with a bold inyourface roasted coffee flavor poured from a twelve ounce bottle dated 2019  body poured bible black with initial head that receded to a thin ring around the edge during the tasting  the nose is roasted coffee with chocolate flavor expressed from the malts very pleasing  the body follows the nose but adds a significant bitterness chocolate malts and char arrive with the bitterness than all fade to a dry finish  mouthfeel is good though a bit thin for my expectations of a stout of high abv the powerful flavor more than compensates  coffee fans must track this beer down youll thank me later
6083,P√©ch√© Mortel,4.19,pours black aroma is best feature of this beer incredibly intense coffee aroma with equally intense dark chocolate  roasty smokey char taste doesnt match aroma tastes like im drinking strong coffee thats it mouthfeel is way too thin for me
6084,P√©ch√© Mortel,4.44,drinking this fucker walking through modern day mcarthur parkif you know you know  its like the 90s all over again here  dieu de ciel  peche mortel imperial stout with coffee no bottle date not a fan of their label rework at all but its whats inside that counts right  drinking it out the bottle so forgive my notes nose is alll roasted coffee goodness cacao nibs semi sweet chocolate and dark malts a bit on the sweeter side  as with all well made stouts taste follows nose with that big robust coffee flavor  semivsweet chocolate cacao dark fruit and big dark malt flavor that adds some sweetness coffee balances this well cuz its not overpowering sweetness at all very mild   look dont know  feel as expected from non ba coffee stout lingers on the palate for a while and gives your teeth that drinking coffee dry feel  overall  enjoyable no bullshit coffee stout thanks micada
6085,Coors Light Iced T,5,this was the perfect beer it is time for coors light iced t to return i havent stopped thinking about it since 2013
6086,Coors Light Iced T,2.84,2 years ago i was on the beach and at the bar there were serving this new drink for free so i wanted to give it a try the smell is quite nice i got to say they tried to reproduce the flavour of the iced tea and i think the combination of it is quite nice on a hot summer day its a real refreshing beer very different that those lime beer i got to tell u won t get drunk with that beer very easily thats why i give a 3 because on a hot summer day drink 1 or 2 is definitely refreshing even for women this beer might impressed u would i recommend it i will say yes its a changement from all those lime beer
6087,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,3.04,24 oz can 24 053 purchased cold from a casey store in the dakotas this week decanted into a busch shaker pint  yellowamber liquid very mild haze luxuriously silky wavy head this actually looks fantastic lace city smells like industrially artificial sugar cookie with a sweet creamed corn character maybe a slight sickly corn likker booziness accenting overall very potent in your face on the palate moonshine and malt syrup  yuck  i cant even imagine any resemblance to a cheap tripel luckily its relatively dry almost weightless on the palate with only the slighest residual film and warmth as unique as this is its far from well brewed though it has potential i do suspect this was a lower abv malt liquor cut with grain alcohol or moonshine somethings quite off about it beware of this  only drink this ice cold from the can 2175
6088,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,2.42,poured from a can straw in color with a white head smells of corn malt and a sweet hint flavors of grain malt and a boozy bitter background not what i would call a great taste but its not the worst worth the try for the dollar i spent
6089,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.79,24oz can date code indecipherable poured into an arcoroc nonic pint glass  a  poured a clear golden color with a quickly receding head that left no lacing on the glass  s  smells of malts adjuncts and green apples abv is not hidden well in the nose  t  initial tart green apple and corn notes fade to leave a boozy bitterness at the back of the throat overall harsh flavor despite the word smooth being printed almost ten times on the can  m  lightbodied with medium carbonation feels somewhat slick as it moves around the mouth  o  among others within the style even other hgls this one is far from pleasant tick completed
6090,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,2.4,poured from a can into a pint glass appearance  the beer pours a clear golden color with a one finger head of white foam the head fades very fast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass smell  the aroma of the brew is heavy of a corn syrup sweetness mixed with aromas of a dusty dankness as well as a metallic smell with a touch of cardboard the aroma is overall not the most enticing taste  the taste begins with a sweet corn syrup and caramel taste mixed with a touch of grain and a decently strong paper taste as the taste advances some light mustiness and more paper as well as some metallic tastes comes to the tongue leaving one with a metallic and sweet malt liquor taste to linger on the tongue mouthfeel  the body of the brew is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is high for the style and the more off tastes the feel is good as it minimizes the impact of the flavors on the tongue to its greatest extent overall  not the best malt out there for sure
6091,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,4.94,you pussies this is a mans beer
6092,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.73,24 oz can  pours yellow fast carbonation kills the head to bubbles and a ring no real lacing sticks  the smell is of alcohol some grain alcohol dominates but overall not too offensive  the taste makes my face involuntarily twinges at the taste this is bad  even for the style raw alcohol with an odd sweetness that is tough to describe  this is harsh  it says smooth but dont believe it  this is for people who want a quick buzz at a cheap price i somehow made it through the whole can but never again there are better malt liquors out there this is one of the worst beers ive ever had i dont recommend it even to alcoholics looking for a cheap high abv brew
6093,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,2.25,you know with so many good beers available i keep trying these high gravity lagers just for completions sake and thats kind of sad sure if you want 24 ounces of 12 try this or one of the many other high gravity lagers available or get something quality with less alcohol and have two same result better taste oh well it could have been truly nasty tasting ca 2010
6094,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,3.03,24oz can poured into 12oz tulip poured a clean clear dark yellow color with about 12 inch of white head that dissipated very quickly and left no lacing  the aroma was neutral leaning towards bland  the flavor was also bland except for a bit of alcohol sharpness  the body was light and even with a definite alcohol burn at the finish  drinkability was ok although i would have preferred a smaller format overall it is what it is a cheap buzz 199 for 24oz of 99 beer you could do worse if you need to scratch this style itch

6096,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,2.89,this beer was listed as 99 not 12 good looking pour for the style smell is pretty boozy taste is very close to a barleywine but on the low end of the scale no bad flavors but the booziness is a bit hard to take mouthfeel is medium to full with a lightly bitter finish overall not my type of beer but not bad for the style
6097,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.42,ubc lacrosse wi and under special agreement memphis tn on the can  it pours a fairly dark yellow with a 1 finger head of foam with lots of bubble action  huge corn notes in the smell as well as some grain it also smells the full 99 abv  corn first and foremost followed by some lemon twang that leans towards the tart side saying that it is rough tasting would almost be a compliment smooth is mentioned a few times on the can  the tartness intensifies as the beer warms and in a case like this that is not a good thing  i had to try it it was cheap as dirt i hope my sink doesnt mind a few ounces
6098,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.05,its cheap its 99 and its horrible i like high gravity malt liquors but this is just bad  it was 165 but dont let that price point fool you you can get much better for the same price  its just so strong and full of corn like drinking bio diesel its not super carbonated but it is bubbly its reminds me of sunny delight  its so fake and full of artificial crap strong and syrupy   this is so bad its so strong  i couldnt just drink it like a normal beer  i had to sip it like a wine  it took me a while to finish it  i used to get 4 16 once for 199 at the center market and i used to be able to pound them like nothing and that was when it was 12  and after i had to drink this slowly because it was so bad i barly got a buzz  might as well of got a can of pbr  this stuff is not good  i bought it to see if it was as bad as i remember and the can for the collection  if you dont want to do either of this stay away  get old englishe hurricane steel reserve ice house edge or even natty daddy  anything is better than this even 4loco or other alco pop you can drown out the nasty with 7 up  i do not recommend stay away
6099,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.97,i picked up a 24oz can at my local corner mart looks like a real winner abv is 99 per the label stack high gravity smooth lager reviewed as a malt liquor given its marketing price point and ingredients list served into a pilsner glass in austin texas reviewed live expectations are extremely low  served cold  straight from the fridge sidepoured gently as overcarbonation is anticipated  a no bubble show forms as its poured  pours a predictable clear translucent yellow littered with abundant carbonation bubbles its got some nice vibrance and isnt weak looking like many malt liquors no floating yeast particlessediment is visible its quite clean high transparency you can read text through this beer  the head is initially two fingers wide but recedes to a very thin layer atop the body inside one minute still the retention is better than youd expect for a budget range malt liquor at this high an abv some limited spotty inconsistent lacing does cling to the sides of the glass after the head recedes  overall its an above average appearance for a malt liquor i cant say im looking forward to trying it but there arent any egregious flaws  sm has a heavy malty and adjuncty sweetness loads of corn  mainly adjunct malt syrupsextract not as grainy as would be ideal i also get some faint berry character  strawberry i think its strange and artificial but lends some needed complexity to an otherwise boring aroma to its credit there are no traces of the 99 abv in the aroma i also dont find any yeast character  or any really hop character  not even just a simple floral profile the syrupy sweetness is offputting and im anticipating a sickly buttery texture but this is far from the foulest malt liquor aroma ive come across  average strength  t the syrupy sweetness is certainly the core of the beer but it isnt as offensive as anticipated its got some light graininess and could use more heavy corn adjunct is present alongside the aforementioned artificial strawberry note  which isnt doing the flavour profile any favors i also get a cheap white wine character and some disgusting green apple notes theres no real hop profile here  to be fair i will say that it hides its alcohol content pretty decently but i cant say i like it theres no complexity or subtlety here whatsoever its far from an intricate or gestalt build unbalanced as well  mf buttery smooth wet and sticky overcarbonated as hell presence on the palate is abysmal its making me a bit ill has a bit too much weight body and thickness for how little flavour there is its very filling the texture doesnt seem well designed for this flavour profile execution is quite poor overall but again i do think its worth mentioning that its not a hot or boozy brew which is something of an accomplishment that said its a pretty harsh mouthfeel overall  not astringent or gushed  dr not the worst malt liquor on the market but far from the best its almost sickening but i cant give it a lower rating than this because it isnt watery and still tastes like beer ill be making a concerted effort to finish the entire can its not a sipper but its low quality makes it tough to quaff and consuming it is making me feel terrible especially in my stomach abv is hidden better than youd expect i wouldnt recommend this beer to anybody even just in this style and price range there are better beers and more widely available ones for that matter stick to steel reserve for those nights when classy just doesnt cut it  reasonably atrocious  d

6111,Zonker Stout,4.18,this was another beer that i picked up at the whole foods in jackson wyoming when i was out that way not too long ago dont have this style much but when you come across something this highly rated its worth a go  indeed this lived up to its lofty rating a land description as this was dark varied and wellbalanced plenty of mocha head topped the liquid out although the spotty lacing left behind should have been more extensive that was the only underwhelming aspect of this brew as the roasted rough nose was enough to draw me in lots of barley and dark chocolate in it as the taste contained hints of milk chocolate raisin currant and licorice nuanced varied and a bit mysterious this was dark without being burnt fullflavored without being rich and full bodied without being strong certainly that was no easy feat  the carbonation was light as the flavors lingered and this was nicely roasted without being thin or sweet like espresso and coffee i wouldnt change the amount of alcohol in this as it was spot on and the aftertaste was neither dry nor overtly strong no date was written anywhere as it was a treat to see a map of the snake river on the can once i peeled the label off this held up well and was a clearcut winner for its style as it deserved its rating on here indeed i was glad to put this river through my liver
6112,Zonker Stout,4.73,poured from a 12oz can into a tulip glass  appearance very dark brown nearly black with a dark tan head so large that it required the beer to be poured in two stages the head lingered long and left plenty of lacing  nose dark roast chocolate mixed with sweet  mouthfeel wonderfully thick  attack follows the nose remarkable balance of dark roast bitter chocolate and coffee  finish continues the attack slight hop bitterness  this is the urcraft beer for me  the one that was my real introduction to craft beer many years ago at the brewery in jackson wyoming its still one of my favorite beers ever  im ashamed that im just now getting around to rating it  and i bring home multiple sixes of it each summer vacation after we backpack in the wyoming mountains im not going to pretend to be unbiased still other reviewers seem to agree it deserves a very high rating
6113,Zonker Stout,4.24,12oz can unreadable stamp on can bottom for canning date black colored body with thin mahogany back lit edge one finger of dark tan head left lacing on nondrinking side of the glass aroma of dark roasted malts which express caramel toffee and molasses some chocolate and minor coffee notes taste is slightly sweet with a later bit of bitterness dark roasted malts exude cocoa coffee and caramelmolasses avoids char is still very dark in flavors has a touch of dark fruit hops medium mouth feel silky texture very dry finish leaves some numbness on the tongue very good carbonation classic stout that does the job with malts and no added adjuncts
6114,Zonker Stout,4.24,cant believe i have not rated this one until now one of their classics and one of the best straight up stouts in the region absolutely famous for a reason no frills old school extraordinarily well crafted somehow still flies under the radar black and shiny and frothy from the tap looks gorgeously refined and silky good body but not overly viscous for what it is the nose is earthy and dry no attempt at too much middle malt richness dark chocolate an almost irish thing to the yeast some toasted breadiness fresh ground coffee and minerals just a little alcohol more at temperature maybe oats or dark wheat in the mash here too more nuance than most on the grain side without any real sweetness the flavor has some charcoal character an almost oak aged decadence and smoothness but is yet still dry more coffee dark chocolate light raisin and mocha character along with a silky texture than hangs around just long enough on the swallow and isnt quite neutral on the ferment right on subtle almost rye spice to this too just a little more going on than in most of these but all real subtle they really dont make beer like this anymore nowadays this would have vanilla and milk sugar in it be 9 abv and be bastardized beyond recognition credit to snake river for a world class beer and for not feeling the need to make it trendy if you built it they will come it doesnt get much better than this in the style i would love to try the nitro edition

6119,Zonker Stout,3.94,aroma is coffee darkroasted malts and slightly burnt the flavor is roasted malts chocolate coffee a hint dark fruit and a slightly acidicsomewhat smooth finish
6120,Faro,4.37,pours a clear golden yellow 1 eggshell head that fades out to a coaster of head moderate lacing nose is malic green apple good funk and rounder barrel notes far back complex belgian candi sugar notes come through as it warms but fairly mild taste follows  nicely tart but not bracing very little residual sugar just a touch of dark fruit on the palate finish is dry and mouthfeel is moderate with good weight lightly carbonated a very enjoyable and well executed beer
6121,Faro,3.95,think this was a sept 2018 release apple and lemon tart definitely fruity mild funk very easy drinking d half of the bottle 24 hrs later showed even more funk on nthe nose less apple more lemon for only 8 on closeout this was a qpr darling
6122,Faro,4.25,rare stateside example no added sweetener or unfermented sugar in the process bottled conditioned with belgian candi sugar that ferments out  moderately tart and juicy with citrusy grapefruit and lemon dry oak in the aftertaste hazy amber with mild wet hay funk in the aroma medium bodied well attenuated very tasty and reminiscent of 3f faro i had earlier this year before toer de geuze
6123,Faro,4.18,had on tap find many faros to be very sweet cumulatively but this was not the case here the barrel presence really helped balance plus the lemon brett grass hay cracker malt and orange zest add in enough crisp flavor by themselves smell is more brett and citrus forward than taste feel is incredibly airy and bright wonderful for a faro really one of the best faros i have had
6124,Faro,4.25,on draft stemmed glass slightly cloudy straw yellow body one finger white head good retention bit of lacing here and there smell is funkforward oak dry lemon a bit of bright citrus zest mild acetic acidity leather white grape zest a touch of grain flavour is incredibly refreshing it has some complexity to it from the method traditionelle component bright citrusy lemon bit of leathery brett damp oak but tempered by the light acetic acidity and grainy lemonforward presence of meerts the sugar doesnt really play a big role here it seems to perhaps add a bit of dryness mouthfeel is medium bodied good carbonation incredibly refreshing and reenergizes my palate with every sip i take after drinking the stout i had next to it a really tasty brew from ffg it combines the best of the two things they do quite well
6125,Budweiser 66,2,had that one time at a party back in the day i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included
6126,Budweiser 66,1.8,a 300ml clear glass bottle with a bb of march 2013 the label states that it is brewed in the uk and describes it as lightly carbonated with a smooth easy taste sounds like bollocks to me  poured into a straight pint glass a clear pale straw colour with light carbonation a hard pour results in a large head of white foam that disappears rapidly aroma of almost nothing initially some faint malt and little else as it warms unwelcome hints of stewed corn and sulphur appear gross  tastes of ultralight malt with a faint sweetness no hops or bitterness whatsoever this could well be the most flavourless beer ive ever tried mouthfeel is thin and watery with a mild tingly dryness no body  could pass as mineral water a weak aftertaste of stewed veg  crap this has to be the blandest most characterless brew ever to pass my lips almost no taste a weak and unpleasant aroma and no body or depth just bad on every level avoid at all costs
6127,Budweiser 66,1.22,a  very pale yellow with absolutely no head at all a couple of tiny bubbles rising to the surface too but not many  s  hardly any smell at all mainly a very faint sweet smell but bland for the most part  t  very bland again for the most part although it finishes with a sugary sweet kind of taste  m  very light bodied  smooth going down with very little carbonation  d  this beer has absolutely no taste other than a very faint sugar like finish  the fact that there was no head at all when i poured it suggests it should be avoided it tastes so much like water than i wouldnt even call it beer  more reviews at httpabarwithnonamewordpresscom
6128,Budweiser 66,1.09,this beer is brewed for the uk market only i am lead to believe god knows where it is actually produced  clear 300ml bottle the cap already promised to a ba in the us jermsumm gets it in my next package  the brew number is a special one it means something to a lot of british people which is obviously why bud choose 66  when a brit hears the number 66 it reminds him of different things depending on age and education 1066 the battle of hastings where we defeated an invading french army 1666 the great fire of london 1966 when england won the football world cup for the first and only time or the iconic route 66 from chicago to la however a number between 65 and 67 is what itll mean to most who buy this beer if they can count that high  i poured the beer into a hoegaarden crand cru stemmed tulip glass to give it some class this failed to have the desired effect  it looked like a regular lagerpilsnerhelles golden clear clean and bright the white head leaving before it had fully arrived a trait i hate  youll not be suprised to hear the beer had very little aroma or taste in fact it reminded me of fizzy water such was its characterless gassy flavourless makeup perhaps im being unkind here hey no im not this beer is terrible to the core if it had a core to be terrible too  there was a mini hint of sweetness from something but i couldnt detect any hop malt or yeast involvement whatsoever it this so called brew most likely the worst beer ive ever reviewed since joining this site  my soninlaw bought me this on his first anniversary of his marriage to my daughter cant wait for next years treat
6129,Presidente,3.75,underrated for sure so much flavor malty grainy light straw in color bright playful mouthfeel worst i can say is it had a wee bit of metal but subdued as it drank
6130,Presidente,4,first off this is not a perfect beer but it does what its trying to achieve as close to perfection as i could imagine this is a beer that was designed for hot dominican days under the sun it cannot afford to be heavy for as light as it is its got plenty of flavor and the flavor is malty and delicious
6131,Presidente,2.96,presidente the beer no president would ever drink
6132,Presidente,2.69,its not great not terrible kind of reminds me of a maltier thicker version of mich ultra but with a little bitter tinge to it this was from a can so wasnt off flavors just has a bit of hop to it i guess
6133,Presidente,2.5,shared 330 ml green bottle at local tasting pale golden colour low white head weak sweetish aroma notes of grass and artificial candy bland flavour but not offensive no doubt drinkable under the dominican sun but far from a great beer
6134,Presidente,1.06,not sure if this is just an off beer of far out of date or whats going on but it smells like must and the flavor is pretty offensive and astringent i do not enjoy this one and would have a hard time getting it down its not for me
6135,Presidente,2.28,12oz bottle into a pint glass best by 12121 so couple days late here actually brewed in st louis for freshness  pale watery yellow body steady carbonation small white head shrinks to a ring and covering but does leave some lacing  strong corny aroma  corn on the taste lightly sweet  mouth between thin and medium finish sweet and slightly grainy  overall not my cup of tea
6136,Presidente,3.66,bottle purchased at carnegie diner in new york ny  this one pours a golden yellow color with a small head and lots of lacing  this smells like crackery malt corn and grainy sweetness  this is definitely your basic caribbean lager but served super cold its fine its very crisp with very little flavor but its refreshing  there are no real off flavors here and its nicely drinkable with a crisp and clean feel  this gets the job done its not a great beer or anything but it does just fine
6137,Presidente,5,not many pilsners out there with more flavor has a pungent after taste that i really enjoy a cold presidente goes down quick and is hard to beat for refreshment an underappreciated beer that is great for all day weekend events or if youre drinking regularly in the evenings and want to keep the toll on your beer gut in check not the cheapest pilsner but much more affordable than my shi shi taste in neipas that are frequently in the 15 range for a 4pack everything a good pilsner should be and a little more full bud is my other go to pils but lacks the bold flavor and international appeal of presidente
6138,Presidente,3.4,12oz green bottle freshest before 12dec21 poured into a vintage bowtie glass at fridge temp 5 abv per label the beer pours brilliantly bright pale gold with off white head the head recedes to a pencil thin ring and few bubbles slight lacing the aroma is pale malt corn and slight sweetness the taste is semisweet pale malt with corn vegetable oil movie theater popcorn butter and faint bitterness the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a somewhat dry finish overall not great
6139,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,2.31,imagine the most artificial strawberry flavor you can now add the flavor of throwing up tequila that is strawberita at 25 ounces and 8 abv this is a four loko that doesnt make you immediately commit felonies would you like a diverse flavor profile would you like something complex or subtle do you want to enjoy a beverage this is not the drink for you do you want to get significantly toasty with two cans for 700 at your local grocery store do you want to drink bottom shelf wine while maintaining some semblance of manhood do you enjoy vomit or sugar hangover headaches this my friend is the drink for you enjoy at your own risk but only if youre broke under 25 a woman or have a death wish cheers

6141,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,1.96,split a can served frozen into a margarita glass  review from notes  like all variations of this beer  i think its just too damn sweet the thing is like 90 hfcs this one also has a ton of citric acid to help the sugar rot away your teeth and your dignity  just not worth it
6142,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,5,my favorite out of the rita series  lookbright red smellcan smell strong strawberry smell tastestrong strawberry tastevery little alcohol tasteit is sweet but good feelslightly crab overalla very good drink
6143,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,1.79,pours a shock of red koolaid no head formation strong whiff of intensely fake strawberry liquor essentially liquid jello shots in a glass taste follows that road precisely feel is thick sugary and raw like a dessert before its cooked
6144,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,4.7,strawberrita has no foam nor lacing but it does have lots of bubbles and a semiclear red color the aroma is of strawberry drink and the flavor is of that too with some pale malt  tartness mouthfeel is high medium and strawberrita finishes drying in that highfructose corn syrup fashion  rjt
6145,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,4.75,similar if not the same to the bud light lime a ritas
6146,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,2.88,25 oz can code 19173 purchased cold poured into a 28 oz mug  l cloudy fruitpunch colored liquid foam on pour quickly collapses to nothing persistent activity of bubbles rising observance mostly copied from my recent review of the limearita  s strawberry big league chew  no other way to describe it intense but little booze presence ok well yes the margarita lime element does slowly emerge  t whoa not strawberry really  fake artificial sweetsinjected strawberry gummy strawberry now i gotta know whats in artificial strawberry  25 fruit essence 75 sugar this doesnt have the pool liner highlight that the reg lime has  is it more pool float the flavorings in this bury the malt beverage base more than their standard limearita  f its not allout syrupy but theres definitely a concentrate or two slicksliding though its core for 8 the booze is buried rather well not laborious to swill fantastically mellow in its alcohol presence but nonetheless a tad too weighty also mostly entirely copied from my limearita review  finding out these things are onenote  o thought the taste of this would wash out that of the flagship limearita i just had moments ago and boy was i right this is seriously carbonated malty strawberry mad dog 20 20 the flavorings of these are totaste with everyone naturally but 2 brands in and its apparent each variation was designed to appeal to an adolescent palate 1468
6147,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,3.37,this is a party drink you only break these out if youre trying to get drunk very sugary makes your teeth feel gritty
6148,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,2,clear light pink liquid with small white head aroma of strawberries sugar boost grain and sugar taste is medium to high sweet and light bitter with notes of strawberries sugar and boost medium bodied with medium carbonation awful
6149,Keystone Lager,2,keystone played a part in my high school years chasing the bottled taste in a can unfortunately i can only find the light version distributed around these parts but will snap this up and revisit with an updated review as soon as i fine the regular stuff which apparently still exists
6150,Keystone Lager,1.94,i had some hope for this one as a buddy claimed it was good i dont know exactly what i smelled when the can opened but it was not good unfortunately this overwhelmed everything else about the beer
6151,Keystone Lager,2.58,keystone as well as the more common keystone light were common around here in the 1990s now even keystone light is hard to find would be a good lawn mowing beer if available though
6152,Keystone Lager,2.62,serving type 341 ml bottle  a pours a decent enough looking golden liquid with a sudsy 1 finger white head that dissipates quickly minimal lacing  s sour apples and light grain flavours  t distinct flavour of apples and other odd fruit even vegetable notes not tasteful in any way  m light body and moderately high prickly carbonation  o while not the worst beer ive ever had i certainly wouldnt go out of my way to buy keystone sure its drinkable but thats the only compliment i really have for it
6153,Carling Lager,2.74,i buy this in summer and keep in the fridge at our cottage good to drink instead of water and to serve in quantity to my kids not horrible and usually one of the cheaper brands always available at the store a go to for summer hot days when we can chill outside on a hot day
6154,Carling Lager,3,meh not bad
6155,Carling Lager,2.35,draught
6156,Carling Lager,3.68,i guess people are rating the beer poorly because its not a style they like they really did nail the style except the nose may have been a little too grainy also the beer was right up against expiration and had a slight oxidation taint
6157,Carling Lager,3.18,completely solid canadian style adjunct ive written about this in the past and i think that canadian adjuncts should be considered the own subcategory although im far too illiterate to explain what exactly that would entail i do know however that the majority of canadian adjuncts ive had that arent sold stateside molson export labatt 50 etc have a richer flavor and creamier body than most american adjuncts with even loss hop presence than their american counterparts and a warmer embrace of cereal nodes  this is a good example of the style though not as good as labatt 50 or molson ex firm cereal start crisp and lightly sour middle light finish with a creamy body throughout  i dont know where this falls into the subsuperpremium tier of the ontario beer market or if such a tiering system even exists outside of the us but id say this would compete well against the pabstbudcoors segment of the american market if you absolutely despise macros then of course you wouldnt like this and i dont see why youd bother to rate it
6158,Tripel,4.25,very nice tripel allagash quality not necessarily special but really good
6159,Tripel,3.25,bottled 33023 drank 9623  the yarchives  mostly opaque bright orangeyellow appearance  a slow pour yielded a nice white head strong lacing remained  skunk spray banana dry grass  fresh flower notes in the nose  skunk spray banana dry wheat  mild booze heat flavors  this was stored cold when i bought it but who knows what happened before thenill have to try it again to make sure this hadnt gone bad but for now i must rate it as a skunky odd tripel
6160,Tripel,4.23,poured from a bottle into a pint glass appearance  the beer pours a very lightly hazed yellowamber color with a small head of white foam the head fades rather fast leaving a bit of streaky lace on the sides of the glass smell  the aroma is quite heavy of a yeasty and spicy aroma with lots of coriander and clove along with these smells comes a rather strong showing of banana and bubblegum as well as orange and candied sugar notes of white pepper and a rather decently strong doughy smell are there as well and with a touch of hay and grass a sweet and inviting aroma is produced overall taste  the taste stars out with a sweet candied sugar orange and banana flavor mixed with some grape juice and a sweet doughy taste at the same time the spice that was in the nose is well represented in the tongue with flavors of coriander and clove as well as some light white pepper and lemongrass at the taste advances the sweetness gets slightly stronger all while the doughy flavor takes on more of a cracker malt taste drying things out a touch at the same time a yeastiness becomes more pronounced as well toward the end the spice gets more intense and is joined by some lemon and a bit of hay leaving one with a sweeter but very pleasant taste to linger on the tongue mouthfeel  the body of the brew is crisp with a higher carbonation level and lots of prickly carbonation bubbles for the style the feel is fantastic and makes for a nice sipper overall  a quite nice triple that is big on sweetness but still very drinkable and pleasurable quite nice
6161,Tripel,4.68,like most of allagashs beers outstanding the strong ale is fullon flavor banana and other spices and a great beer will definitely buy again and again
6162,Tripel,4.53,pours golden yellow with faint white cap in mini tulip notes of clove and spice make this a really nice tripel at 9 abv
6163,Tripel,4.39,classic belgian esters and slight banana and clove great belgian
6164,Tripel,5,i have tried this one out of a big bottle with a cork it poured nice golden color smelled like honey and almonds also had a very nice carbonation flavor of clean golden triple apricot and finishes up with a little bit of that pine bitterness is at the end
6165,Tripel,4.28,pours an awesome 3 finger head with lots of lacing down the glass a but musty and metallic on the nose is the only drawback taste is fantastic and clean with some nice soft belgian candi and no aftertaste the drinkability rivals any true belgian you can find soft and light tasting but flavorful and strong this is one damn good beer
6166,Tripel,4.5,minimal belgian yeast character when cold but the esters show up as it warms however never overdone
6167,Tripel,4.36,tripel pours a clean crisp gold with a modestly sized lacing head the aroma is filled with clove and banana the flavor is rich sweet and sugary candylike with cloves and bananas good body and feel overall lots of flavors sweeter and brighter
6168,Citrus Squall,3.9,pours a mediumdark yellow color with a minimal head that disappears quickly aroma of grapefuit but the taste is very strong grapefuit slightly salty and no hoppy bitterness a good summer brew
6169,Citrus Squall,4,bought a 6pack cans 1199 foodland 4 months before jan 2024 stamp on can smell of passionfruit grapefruit citrus hazy goldenorange color mediumheavy mouthfeel taste of grapefruit passion fruit some tartness oranges on the aftertaste alcohol hidden really well overall a refreshing hot weather beer if you like grapefruit as it is strongly present
6170,Citrus Squall,4.32,incredibly refreshing smells and looks awesome taste wise it has an upfront hit of grapefruit and hoppiness but it isnt bitter at all the 8 abv is super well disguised and you can easily tear through multiple cans of this on a warm summer night or day  overall its a very good beer and one of the best ive had
6171,Citrus Squall,4.59,this brew boasts a hazy yellow appearance and a lasting white head the nose is fascinatingly complex there is an agreeable bitterness to it the beer is mediumfull bodied it tastes earthy and vegetal in a good way the high abv isnt apparent in the palate or nose this is an enormously interesting  and successful  experiment its weird in the best possible way ill have it again  soon
6172,Citrus Squall,4.07,12 ounce can poured real cold into a can glass stubborn foam barely stayed for a photo op smells of grapefruit lime taste stymied me a little thought dfh was gonna try to make me like a kinda sour ale wrong theres the grapefruit thing right up front hop yada yada then bing theres tequilla in there i know i know its blue agave but my brain told me something else its not a sour folks its a summer quencher and it does just that mouth is light and lively medium carbonation overall a surprise hit that i wish was just a bit prettier nice
6173,Citrus Squall,4.16,dogfish head craft brewery citrus squall 12 fl oz can coded jan 2024 d 194 3 1405 11 sampled on aug 13 2023 233  wegmans king of prussia pa  notes via stream of consciousness ive just sampled the hazy squall so im wondering what this is the label says that its a double golden ale with grapefruit juice lime peel and blue agave nectar ok then its poured a hazy golden body beneath a fingers width of white foam the aroma expresses grapefruit and light malt on to the flavor then its surprisingly sweet it tastes like a grapefruit candy i didnt get any of the lime peel in the nose but i get some of it here i get a little bit of alcohol but not much the malt is sweet and lightly grainy bready and oatlike i like it and it works well to support the fruitiness thats there grapefruit is generally a bitter fruit but im not finding that here theres some coming out in the finish but i would think it would be more bitter overall thats ok i like it its a onetrick pony but its a good trick i generally think of fruity beers like this as multiple serving beers but not this one its 8 abv to start and although its sweet i think that after two or three that bitterness from the grapefruit will start to build i also think that youll just be bored with it by then regardless of how good it is to start with on the negative side the head did not hold up well and thus it left next to nothing in terms of lacing i really like this but it is a kind of a one and done beer although at 8 thats not necessarily a bad thing i think its nicely balanced and rounded and quite enjoyable if you love grapefruit youve gotta get citrus squall review 8714
6174,Citrus Squall,3.99,picked up a sixer last week at shoppers in germantown seemed a good match for all the heat weve been having nose is grapefruit and lime and i guess agave flavor brings the sour citrus early and then flattens in out where the aftertaste is complex yet clean not really what im looking for from a flavor or style standpoint and i am in no ways a tequila drinker but this is actually pretty good for what it is you dont taste the eight percent much either for eleven bucks a sixer you could do a lot worse
6175,Citrus Squall,4.43,poured from a can into a sampler glass at a tasting festival my sadness in learning that sea quench ale is no longer being distributed here due to low sales was overshadowed by this delicious brew hid the alcohol taste well and went down smooth cheers
6176,State Light American Lager,3,so sad nt are awesome craft but this one was mafe foftje mainstream and certaily tastes like it in a blind taste test i would of guess this was a product of a mass brewer
6177,State Light American Lager,3.43,poured from a 16 oz can has a yellow color with a 12 inch head smell is of grains taste is mild grains malts highly refreshing feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent example of a light beer
6178,State Light American Lager,4.13,16 oz can nice hop presence which somewhat masks the lowcal flavor yellow body with a fluffy white head which was slow to dissipate one of the better light lagers ive had
6179,State Light American Lager,3.02,purchased at nastase beverage in bellfonte  look pours extremely clear bright and a very faint pale straw yellow with and all white head that quickly settles with some minimal side glass lace looks like the pour of a mich ultra and not inviting at all aroma its all in the form of grass grain corn husk a light beer with 42 abv with few interesting characterisitcs taste same as aroma and look has all the trademarks of an economy macro brew from the last century unfortunately no economy at 3499 case price new trail just throwing something out there for psu tailgating
6180,State Light American Lager,2.96,excellent light american lager i managed to find a six pack of pint cans for 899 which is only a dollar more than miller light in my area sweet and simple quite refreshing these would probably be the perfect companion to brats and a ballgame
6181,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.24,look it pours amber on the dark side with an off white head head retention is low  smell it has deep caramel aromas with citrus there are some orange notes with some nuts and a very low level of molasses  taste it has caramel favors with citrus and orange there are some nutty notes with pine and floral as well  feel it has a full chewy body with strong alochol warming edging on the hot side  overall complex flavors with strong alcohol is nice for one beer
6182,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.98,this was a fantastic surprise i expected good things and was impressed beyond expectations dogfish head has captured the essence of utopias in a highly drinkable ipa
6183,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.28,12oz bottle poured into a tulip  a pours a hazy amber with a ruby hue onefinger foamy white head reduces to a ring  s the barrel dominates the aroma with plenty of utopias notes popping through sherry and cognaclike notes with aromas of cherry red grape toffee  caramel faded hop aromas of candied orange and some floral notes a bit of booze to close it out  t rich and malty up front with bold notes of caramel and toffee immediately complimented by the barrel adding notes of cognac sherry and wet oak midpalate gives a hint of tang that cuts through the sweetness before giving way to the base beer which gives faded hop notes of citrus peel and red berries the finish is boozy with the barrel notes really coming through lingers of caramel booze oak and red berries  m medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into a warming boozy finish  o huge barrel notes throughout on this one i love utopias so i enjoyed it but the base beer of a boozy ipa probably isnt the best choice
6184,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.43,12 oz  pours cloudy amber like unfiltered apple cider no head  aroma is of apple biscuit honey maybe some molasses well into barleywine territory  flavor is very rich caramel molasses honey pecan biscuit fig eventually giving way to oak and malted barley there is a notable hop finish but it is no match for the richness of the sweeter flavors  full viscous body with a stinging carbonation on the tongue accentuated by a booze bite that warms going down  this is just a really good barleywine at this point were so far beyond ipa that its kind of comical they still market it as such the overwhelming richness of the malt bill is the centerpiece of this beer the hops are barely noticeable in the flavor only approaching prominence in the aftertaste theyre undetectable in the aroma im not complaining its a really good beer im just amused unfortunately i have never had the pleasure of trying utopias so i cant comment on what if any notes here are contributed from that barrel aging but it is obviously different from the standard 120 mostly its just more than the standard 120 definitely an experience
6185,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.09,l a bit cloudy dark amber color s really boozy upfront only a little bit of hops t really different i like how well balanced this beer is but this is definitely a big beer with really intense flavors this is not for amateurs f its a well balanced beer but strong feel at the same time o overall i like this beer but would probably like the 90 minute and 60 minute ipa better very strong and not for the faint hearted yet the key is that this beer is balanced flavorwise
6186,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.26,from a bottle dark amber color with a few bubbles when pouring brown sugar and raisin aroma full bodied with moderate carbonation maple syrup and raisin with an earthy hop finish definitely unique almost a portsherry crossed with an ipa
6187,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.15,growler into pint glass pours a gorgeous clear amber with a brief white head no lacing initial impression is sweet maple syrup candied orange grapefruit rind and caramel mouthfeel is nice and sticky finish fades to a sweet citrus overall a bit sweet for my tastes but at 17 you tend to forgive such minor transgressions
6188,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.46,poured at fridge temp pours a nice amber color with lots of little bubbles rising throughout not much head the nose is candied oranges maple toffee and citrusy hops the taste is pretty insane wow i am fighting for the right words here not really feeling like an ipa definitely leaning more barleywine the flavors evolve rapidly on the palate first comes a slightly bitter hoppy sensation which is followed a pillow of sweet caramel grapefruit peel is subtle candy plums and malty greatness this is truly unique and im in need of another bottle the abv is not detectable certainly doesnt drink at 17 abv
6189,Labatt Blue Light,2.38,tastes like beer watered down still it is refreshing when youre thirsty if you have a touchy stomach like i do its a good choice that is  if price is an issue
6190,Labatt Blue Light,2.51,12oz can  on a hard pour 2 fingers of head that dissipates as son as it goes above the rim of my glass the head itself dissipates to a surprisingly clingy ring around the glass that actually leaves some lacing although over a couple minutes it dissapears body is a clear light golden yellow  aroma is basically just cheap beer theres that industrial lager funk going on that implies dryness but not much else  flavor is similar to the aroma but i actually get some malt again not a lot going on but i guess there is some citrus from the hops like regular blue  for a light beer the feel is fine but not great the finish is verging on long with a mouth coating seemingly dry maltiness  overall not a bad cheaper light beer certainly better than coors light but not all that amazing
6191,Labatt Blue Light,4.36,the lightest crispest and most inoffensive cheap beer option
6192,Labatt Blue Light,5,blue light is easily one of the most prestigious beverages around have you ever just wanted to slam 24pack well this is the beer to do it with after drinking 1012 of these only thing you can think is dang that went down to easy if you luck the magical labatt will bless you with out a hangover best beert
6193,Labatt Blue Light,3.39,a notch above southern mainstream corn style lights in taste imo def go to when in the north
6194,Labatt Blue Light,2.63,12oz can into a tall lager glass l pours pale light caramel w a thin eggshell white head decent large carbo bubbles light random splotchy lacing s grains lightly sweet malts corn lightly metallic a light trace of pastry dough t sweet grains corn a hint of malting a suggestion of grassy hops lightly pale no aftertaste f gently fizzy lighter bodied feel w a very fast finish that is rather drying o fast dry easy drinking and rather light on taste and thats good as its quite dry on the tongue which aids in faster drinking i enjoy the dryness of it and think its good in its style
6195,Labatt Blue Light,2.23,this was another one bottle purchase good thing that i didnt get more terrible beer i really had a hard time drinking this one as the taste reminded me of diluted beer at least what i thought

6197,Gratitude,4.3,poured from a can at fridge temp pours a murky orange with a thin layer of head nose is wonderful  toffee candy all the way werthers raisins plums a touch of minty pine maple and a slight citrus peel note  the taste is awesome a perfect balance of sweetness and slight bitterness from the hops wow toffee pine citrus peel raisins figs candy big malty note bread and alcohol heat really well done  the mouthfeel is dry medium bodied and nicely warming some alcohol bite is there the aftertaste is primarily citrus peel bitterness overall a wonderful example of an american barleywine i cant wait to see how these age for a little while
6198,Gratitude,4.27,2022 vintage 12 oz can  pours a very dark copper color clear thick cream colored head great head retention very nice aroma  toasty caramel malt classic chops  citrus dank pine similar flavors in the taste good balance between the malt and firm bitterness just a touch boozy sticky mouthfeel medium bodied
6199,Gratitude,3.73,pours a bright almost glowing light amber plenty of head that for some reason reminded me of a tan macaron in both color and texture overall this is an attractive beer  aroma is sweet caramel and molasses with fig and some light alcohol lurking its fairly reserved overall in that nothing bursts from the glass that said it still smells quite good  on the tongue the alcohol makes a clear and immediate impression as does the bite from the hops the malts definitely take a back seat theres a little bit of sweetness but its clearly secondary  full bodied and silky smooth theres a little bit of alcohol warming on the way down but its subdued low to medium carbonation very long finish  overall a good saturday sipper
6200,Gratitude,4.36,not sure how i dont have this rates ive had it several times before  ill rate this 2022 can  the amber hue is beautiful also noting hefty sediment st the bottom of the glass  the smell isnt mind blowing its fairly benign and unassuming  the flavor profile is very bigfootesque but definitely better its less bitter than bigfoot and has more caramel sweetness still a pretty bitter and quintessential example of an american barleywine in fact i would argue this is probably thee american barleywine measuring stick bigfoot is just too much of a palate wrecker though it does convey all the aspects to familiarize one with the style gratitude does it equally as well but with more refinement imo  the feel is a little sticky up front but dries out quickly on the finish as you exhale an evaporating heavy dose of ethanol  overall im drinking this one at cellar temperature of about 57ish and im not enjoying it quite as much as i recall previously could be a beer thats better more chilled could be im off very likely or could be accurate at 425    drinking this again on 12222 this time chilled this is arguarbly the best american barleywine i know and blows bigfoot away with balance and refinement bumping twste and overall from 425 to 475 each for being the arguably best ive experienced per style
6201,Gratitude,4.41,poured from a 12oz can into a snifter pours like sun tea or apple cider with a one finger offwhite foam head lot of dried dark fruits in the nose maybe even some burnt sugar  caramel taste follows with a pleasant fruity wet cardboard barleywine flavor this is pretty old school american in the sense that its not very toffee or caramel forward more hoppy and fruity it has a wonderfully full mouthfeel enough carbonation but its still creamy and way too east drinking for 11 even as it warmed up it still maintained an easy drinking stature with wonderful fruity hoppy undertones good stuff
6202,Gratitude,4,pours a deep burgundycaramel color with a couple fingers of offwhite foam transparency is obscured by a firm haze aroma is fig raisins molasses toffee and strong earthy toasty and caramely malts underneath resiny earthy hops extend the nose a bit further adding a light stickiness thats overshadowed by a dirty earthy note it really leans more into an earthy nose with malts and hops building on this quality booze is obscured flavor profile is caramel toffee molasses fig and raisins layered over malts and hops malts are forward coming by way of earthy caramely and toasty they ride the heels of the former list of flavor notes hops dont become apparent until the after taste which carries a heavy sticky resiny hop quality in addition to mild dank and pine it never leans into sweet nor bitterness striking a middleoftheroad balance booze never pops through mouth feel is mediumthick with a still boiled texture overall driving malts and big sticky hops keep this one lively its simplistic perhaps a little old school but is otherwise clean allowed to warm quite a bit between sitting it out before the pour photo and playing some wii resort golf it warmed towards 55f it become more muddled as it warmed which is contradictive to the style  served in a 155oz spiegelau tulip from a 12oz can 2022 vintage consumed  reviewed in march 2022
6203,Gratitude,3,thanks to pinz412 for this one from one of the nbs bifs i think spring 21 unsure of the vintage bronze label with dark purple wax and a red cap 22oz bottle poured into 16oz tulip poured a very muddy mediumdark brown color with just a thin cap of tan head that had low retention and almost no lacing  the aroma had the expected sweet malts of the style some caramel and a slight mustiness  same on the tongue with the addition of a bit of unpleasant bitterness on the finish some alcohol heat as well  the body was the expected full sweet and had a semisweet finish that dried out after a few moments  drinkability was ok but was hurt by a lack of carbonation  overall i really wanted to like this brew a lot but it was just lacking all across the board i still think im being generous with my score maybe its better fresher or older or a different vintage i dunno ymmv
6204,Lagerbier Hell,4.25,a particularly mild sparkling long stored beer refreshing and easily digestible at the same time uniquely in its taste a benefit for each beer connoisseur  clear golden liquid white foam cap  malty  sweet grains  good helles
6205,Lagerbier Hell,4.52,500ml bottle  pours a pale honeystraw colour with foamy 15 finger head aroma is subtle bready malt and a little bit earthy taste pretty much follows the aroma however the sweet maltiness is intensified and leaves a very nice sweet finish that lingers looks and tastes great an exceptional beer
6206,Lagerbier Hell,3.94,creamy mellow and light light floral aroma not too sweet at all for a helles slight grassy herbal notes straw gold lager lovely feel no problem with this at all
6207,Lagerbier Hell,3.69,poured from a 500ml bottle  pours light straw coloured with minimal visable carbonation and a tight bubbled white head that leaves a nice amount of lacing  the smell is vague  malty and grassy and not very strong the taste is full but mellow  a pleasant bitterness throughout with citric acid  grass and straw  the mouthfeel is pretty good  not greasy or water  good middle ground here overall this is a good beer but  for me at least  not a great one  the citric acid was a little overpowering and where i live i can get beer i prefer in this style for cheaper  nevertheless a pleasant beer  id drink it again 
6208,Lagerbier Hell,4.83,crystal clear pale straw colour with a white head huge sweet malt on the nose honey dough lightly toasted bread and clean lemon citrus hops the taste follows exactly super clean super light perfectly balanced and with a long sweet finish outstandingly drinkable but with enough going on to be interesting uniquely refreshing hops character and uniquely complex malt profile for such a light beer cant say enough good things about it a perfect lager probably the best in the world and certainly the benchmark by which all other helles must be measured
6209,Lagerbier Hell,4.25,got one from bi√®res cultes ch√¢telet an excellent beer of this style with malt back and strong smell of freshly cut grass excellent beer
6210,Lagerbier Hell,4.64,grabbed a 05l bottle at the local liquor store type place called benz in sindelfingen crazy to think how long ive wanted to drink this specific beer as helles is one of my favorite styles also crazy to think that this bottle was just over 1 and yep can confirm this is just about as good as it gets for a helles crisp clean and a delicious flavor and finish worth the wait
6211,Lagerbier Hell,4.38,mostly clear golden pour with two fingers of white foam and plenty of lacing honeyed grains with grassy hops german yeast and flowers in the nose taste is much the same but now dial back the flowers and add lemon zest and cracker feel is crisp clean lighter for style but never thin hops are sneaky shaping though not as much as the malt
6212,Centennial IPA,3.75,pours a reddish copper with a generous offwhite head fragrance of pine and citrus tastes of pine citrus and caramel malt mildly bitter with a hint of sweetness  another fine product from founders
6213,Centennial IPA,4.59,slight reddish tinge to otherwise fairly clear brew slight pine spruce note as the hoppiness comes roaring through an ipa lovers delight for sure
6214,Centennial IPA,4.75,well ill be honest this is my goto ipa hoppy goodness with an outstanding maltbalance great amber color hoppy yet sweet aroma bitter yet sweet flavor its in my fridge at all times bonus alert i get a 15pack at the local for 1699 chaching there is nothing i dont like about this beer
6215,Centennial IPA,4.11,this is my everyday beer its the best at its price point although to be fair there arent many 7 beers under 20 for a fifteenrack it has some lovely complex sunny bitterness with some unfortunate blandness in the aftertaste that would work well for someone new to hops compared with some other heavy ipas smooth for 72 but it lacks some of the fruity and citric complexity of its baby cousin the founders all day ipa this is not a special occasion beer its just a solid everyday sipper
6216,Centennial IPA,4.53,very close to a personal fave ipa standard set by bells two hearted its not quite northern midwest but way good especially at 1850 a 15pack 
6217,Centennial IPA,4.22,if youre new to the ipacraft beer scene or not this one is very good not to mention that it comes in a 15 pack and costs a bit less than 12 packs of other fine ipas the beer is outstanding this is a win win
6218,Centennial IPA,5,i have tried many ipas and this is one of my favorites i enjoy it so much i made an account here just to say its definitely worth trying if you enjoy a good ipa
6219,Centennial IPA,3.88,pretty great pours clear with a longlasting frothy head aroma is citrusey and a bit less hoppy than other ipas ive tried flavor is clean citrusey and crisp while it is of course hoppy it is very wellbalanced by the malt giving it a very easytodrink character honestly need to be a bit careful drinking this given how light it tastes for the alcohol content nothing unusual here just a great example of an ipa punches far above its weight for the price 20 bucks for a 15pack
6220,Centennial IPA,4.21,very surprised i ad not reviewed this beer previously sorry i did not because this is a great beer  poured from a can into a tulip glass darkish golden yellow color with a wonderful fluffy beige head and nice curtain lacing smell and taste of pine and citrus floral and slightly herbal vanilla and orange slightly bitter finish and nice malty background definitely will have this beer again
6221,Centennial IPA,4.77,one of the very best widely available ipas
6222,Anchor Steam Beer,4.02,pours a handsome rich copper gold with a decent pillowy white head the smell is biscuit and grain with a hint of hop the taste is some caramel biscuit grain a little bitterness and a decent malt backbone its very balanced drinkable and refreshing and had 2 of these after the diamondbacks baseball game in phoenix at hannys in downtown and sorry to see it go if it is indeed gone
6223,Anchor Steam Beer,3.32,had to try it before it was discontinued looks great but lacking in much flavor at alleverything feels muted quite crushable though
6224,Anchor Steam Beer,3.79,poured from a can into a pint glass pours red orange with a fluffy white head smells of sweet grain with just a tad of smoke tastes of caramelized grain nice profile beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation overall a very good beer
6225,Anchor Steam Beer,3.87,pours a copper color with a minimal head that lasts quite a while aroma is floral notes and roasted malts taste is peppery with a slightly bitter finish had to try this one while it was still available in the stores
6226,Anchor Steam Beer,3.77,poured from a 12 oz can dated 5302023 into a willi becher pint glass l  pours a dark amber color with a white head s  smells malty and earthy t  tastes of malt and caramel f  medium body and carbonation o  great beer when you plan on having a couple it will be a shame to see her go
6227,Anchor Steam Beer,4.29,on tap in san francisco in a pint glass look transparent amber with about 1 finger of white head with decent retention smell subtle herbs and hops taste clean and crisp hints of malt and caramel mouthfeel lightmediumbodied with moderate carbonation overall i am extremely saddened to hear of anchor steam closing down after 127 years this is the end of an iconic american beer and brewery i feel lucky to have had the opportunity to drink this beer on tap when it was still available
6228,Anchor Steam Beer,3.59,malty with earthy hops its crushable a legend has become extinct
6229,Anchor Steam Beer,3.64,a sad day indeed we long ago sipped and enjoyed many an anchor product several were taken down during the first few weeks of the covid lockdowns as there really wasnt much else to do other than try new beer we never put the beer into words from memory though steam was a fantastic sipping beverage with its profile defining bitter hoppy bite the history and tradition you could taste it a real shame to hear earlier this week about the full closing of the brewery the christmas ale was a staple of the holidays for the past number of year a very sad day pour one out for fritz
6230,Anchor Steam Beer,4.13,draft pour into standard shaker pint glass deep amber with a finger of dirty white foam head malty and caramelforward in the nose taste mostly follows maybe some earthy hops in the mix as well but its pretty simple in its structure mediumfull mouthfeel fairly malty mouthfeel with just enough carbonation i havent had this one in many many years but was glad to revisit a craft beer classic
6231,Anchor Steam Beer,2.76,look beautiful amber color thick white head with minor to moderate lacing  smell very clean simple malty bread aroma not much going on but thats not always a bad thing  taste watery malt its simple clean and refreshing but the flavor profile is milder than i would prefer somewhat of a lemony hops bitterness on the back end  mouthfeel thin and watery  overall its an iconic trailblazer that is clean mild and refreshing but a little too simple and a little too watery for my tastes
6232,Raspberry Tart,3.77,appearance dark ruby good light pink head  smell raspberry and pretty strong tartness  taste tart and acidic with the raspberries in the background mix of tart and raspberries in the finish light bodied  overall the other mainstay fruit beer from new glarus raspberry tart follows its name and provides a tart raspberry experience i would have preferred more raspberry and less tart but oh well i prefer the belgian red
6233,Raspberry Tart,4.7,12 oz bottle obtained at the brewery two days ago poured into a clear plastic cup  cloudy raspberry red liquid some lasting foam in the form of a collar redolent raspberry on the nose raspberry pie on the palate fruit and dough approaching fruit shrub in its acidity mesmerizing dimension and expression of the raspberry flavor the tart tingle invigorates my senses its body has a lazy plushness to it almost but not quite nectary an aptly named beer this was my first time having it in about 9 years and i was in heaven looking forward to sharing some with friends back home 2186
6234,Raspberry Tart,4.72,what do i say about one of the best beers of all time its a shame that its only available in wisconsin but probably a good one for my body since it would be stocked all the time if i could get it
6235,Raspberry Tart,4.44,i had stayed away from this beer thinking it would be really sourtart it is not just enough tartness so that it is not overly sweet will put this one on repeat buy list
6236,Raspberry Tart,4.28,poured from a bottle into a pint glass pours deep red with an off whitered head smells of raspberries very inviting tastes of creamy raspberry nice and sweet yet nice and tart beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation overall a very good beer
6237,Raspberry Tart,4.7,poured from a 12ounce bottle into a zwanze 2018 logo stemmed goblet because it seemed like the right thing to do the color approximates a murky and slightly watereddown cola with a short snowwhite head that left lots of spotty lacing no question in my mind as to why this is among the toprated beers of its style its fruit forward with lovely aromas of raspberry jam balanced with notes of light breadiness its sweet but not cloying its tart but not overpowering it has good carbonation and very low bitterness it finishes perfectly dry this made an ideal pairing with grilled chicken and i could imagine that it would be absolutely stellar with crackers and aged wisconsin cheddar the only downside is that its available only in wisconsin but who doesnt like a nice road trip once in a while
6238,Raspberry Tart,3.56,very tart nice raspberry taste but i liked their cherry better
6239,Raspberry Tart,4.15,this is very close to what i imagine a raspberry soft drink would taste like its very sweet which in my opinion is the biggest downside but otherwise is an amazing beer definitely more sweet than a typical fruit lambic or the belgian red
6240,Raspberry Tart,4.5,not too sweet a wellbalanced beer
6241,O'Doul's,3.11,from the bottle it pours a clear light yellow color with nice white head that slowly reduces the nose gets alight dose of grassy hops the mouth gets an initial burst of grass followed by a gentle smooth feeling very lightly malt flavored brew
6242,O'Doul's,2,the only positive thing i can say about this stuff is that its better than coors light way back when we were younger my buddy and i used to by cases of this stuff dump it and replace it with bud so his girlfriend would think he wasnt getting drunk those were the days of course we had to have a few real bottles now and then
6243,O'Doul's,3.06,poured from an undated 12oz can into a smaller antique coors glass  on the pour 1 finger of perfectly average head formed then recedes pretty quickly to a decent cap the body is your typical aal color with fine medium carbonation  aroma is like sex in a canoe after eating a single peanut i cant pick up much of anything at all at least its clean i guess some slight corn way off in the distance  taste is stronger than the aroma but not by much super light but at the same time it is super clean as well some corny malt off in the background again but slightly stronger tastes like corn flakes steeped in carbonated water  feel is bigger than the taste and aroma suggest with the actual feel of beer as opposed to budweiser zero which feels like beer flavored soda medium short finish with a mouthcoating feel carbonation mixed with the decent head is a big driving force here  overall i wish anhueser busch would get it together and make a beer with the feel of this and the taste of budweiser zero or at least make this have more flavor if the taste was stronger it would remind me a lot of tivoli outlaw lager
6244,O'Doul's,5,best non alcoholic beverage ever for us nonalcoholic drinkers
6245,O'Doul's,2.4,very mild straw colored slightly sweet doesnt have the bitter taste of a lot of the other mass market nonalcoholic beers
6246,Budweiser Select 55,1.95,12oz can  on the pour 1 finger of white head formed then quickly dissipated to your average aal head covering body is a standard pale clear straw  aroma is beer minus 90 of everything some cheap funk but i guess the vagueness keeps it okok  taste is ultra watered down budweiser not to the point of being a seltzer but its pretty close there is a slight malty finish but thats about it  feel is where the wateriness really comes through seltzer like feel without the refreshment of water  overall this is a dry malt flavored hard seltzer with 24 abv
6247,Budweiser Select 55,2,had that one time at a party back in the day i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included
6248,Budweiser Select 55,1.06,this is an old review from 2005 i had it for the 99 cal bud select but it was this one  as bad a brew as ive had from one of the major breweriesi thought this would be added flavor being it was selectit is notit has little flavor and what flavor it does have is nastyit literally tastes like i took a glass of waterdropped an ounce of bud light into and mixed it upthis has no redeeming qualities id take a host of light beer over this that have more flavorthe worst purchase i have made in many yearsstick to regular bud if you like ab macros
6249,Budweiser Select 55,1,drainpour
6250,Budweiser Select 55,1,alright so this isnt a great beer but make no mistake this isnt a good beer either
6251,Budweiser Select 55,1,if eberhard and adolphus rolled out of their grave this would be the first beer they destroyed its been said before but ill say it again if youre counting calories drink water or switch to vodka
6252,Budweiser Select 55,1.26,its thin flavorless and odd smelling if youre that worried about carbscalories drink water it tastes better definitely not a beer lovers beer
6253,Budweiser Select 55,4.78,i like light beers and im watching calories i realize a lot of people hated the taste but i was surprised that this tasted so good to me light and crisp and i didnt feel guilty drinking a couple i dont drink a lot so this works for me  its is hard to find bottles and just a 6 pack because it wasnt popular i only find it in 24 cans which doesnt work for me bumper
6254,Budweiser Select 55,2.1,12oz bottle  review from notes  just watered down bud lite basically 24 abv makes me scratch my head in absolute bewilderment who in tarnation is this beer for near beer that isnt near beer  i just dont get it
6255,Budweiser Select 55,1.25,possibly the worst beer i have ever had the look is light and not very frothy the taste is sour and actually made me feel on the queasy side with only 24 abv meaning you would to drink twice as many to get to feeling good makes this beer an even poorer choice sure it s lower in carbs and calories but give me a break i d rather drink na beer because it tastes better  needless to say i will never buy this beer again to call it a lager is a travesty
6256,Budweiser Select 55,2.11,its light
6257,Budweiser Select 55,5,the beer has been unfairly rated and i wanted to clear things up ive been on keto for a long time now this is a low carb beer its extremely watery thinkla croix beer flavored however if you like seltzer water beer and watching your calories and carbsthen this beer does it all allows you to kick em back during the game with your buddies and not have to get out the carb calculator  overall highly recommended for those who are carb or calorie conscious but yea its not gonna blow your mind with its hoppy flavor im just happy there is an option out there like this
6258,Budweiser Select 55,3.63,by no means do i think this is a great beer ore even a good beer what i like about this beer is that you can drink a case of them easily and wake feeling like you didnt drink speaking from personal experience some will love it but it wasnt anything special to me
6259,Old Milwaukee Ice,5,ice beer is never going to be high end judging this against a craft ipa is a mistake because its made to be cheap and get you drunk compared to other ice beers at the same price point i was very pleasantly surprised by how notterrible this tastes
6260,Old Milwaukee Ice,3,olde tyme review here from circa 1994 ok just arrived in the usa with wife poor as fck got some dilapidated duplex in hapeville ga half the houses were boarded upthat kinda place found pout st ides and oe800 40s at 79 cents were the drink of the neighborhood which i happily joined on a friday evening came back to work and my wife was smilingand handed me a 6er of this beer milwaukee ice199 a sixand you know compared the mls it was a nice beerhave to tell you summer of 94 went through a ton of this stuffactually sad it is gone
6261,Old Milwaukee Ice,4.1,16 oz can oct1419 purchased cold single poured into fat tulip  l brilliantlyclear pale yellowamber liquid rather tall 2finger high relatively dense white foam slow collapse of foam rocky center then incredibly thick crusty collar left actually some long bands of lace looks superb  s expected lightlyspiced doughy aromas with perhaps faint almond vanilla notes nutty granola grain most dominant but overall potency is a touch too mellow  t richly malty but relatively dry on the back end not to mention that overtone of lightly caramely nuttiness almost like a biscotto a couple sips in and a semibold mildly herbal cooling bitterness takes hold in the aftertaste faint sweetish booze hanging in the back balanced well vaguely industrial belgian tripel estersphenols  great in a malt liquor but lame in an actual tripel  f as a malt liquor this has a perfectly silkysmooth lightlyluscious body with a hearty quiet afterglow  for an aal it may have too rich of an initial contact but falls short of any residual syrupy drag though it aint bone dry either just divine good grief sipper or slurper it does both  o either one of the best ice beers ive had if not the best or a perfect marriage was made between liquid and temp and glass i got a sort of 2for1 deal on these cans  tempted to have the other right after this but i may need a nap after 1516
6262,Old Milwaukee Ice,2.35,booze overwhelms aal
6263,Old Milwaukee Ice,3.31,poured into a small tasting glass  thick white frothy head lots of bubbles yellowgolden clear spotty lacing  aroma citrusyfruity sweet indistinguishable grain a little breadiness  the flavor has some of that typical gummy ice beer flavor overall the flavor is tepidly light like the regular old milwaukee  the mouthfeel is too thinly carbonated for the style  the finish is crisp refreshing light and watery and fairly dry
6264,Old Milwaukee Ice,1.96,yellow pour with almost no head aroma was massively like fusel alcohol didnt come off like the beer ingredients no malt hop smells  taste was still harsh theres some sweetness like corn in it drink this one cold lots of carbonation all over it gets a lot more bitter as it warms and it isnt a hop flavor bitter
6265,Old Milwaukee Ice,2.5,pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing aroma has slight malt hints the taste follows the nose with a slight nalt flavor a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a decent beer
6266,West Ashley,4.28,had on tap cloudy pale yellow pour with a pearl white head barnyard funk big citrus apricot bright oak and faint flowers in the nose taste is much the same moderate potency amongst a delicate and artful body otherwise sour with beautiful oak texture bright and medium bodied with a kiss of acidity
6267,Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,4.9,169 yum
6268,Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,4.5,2022 vintage drank on tap and from the bottle strong barrel presence with good flavours in the taste chocolate and vanilla stood out the most with strawberry gently in the background
6269,Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,4.77,2022 version sampled from a snifter on tap at ansaris in eagan mn very thick great blend of adjuncts with the strawberry up front in a good way
6270,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.46,w
6271,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.81,another excellent product from what has become my favorite brewery you cant go wrong with weihenstephener this selection is a little difficult to find locally but stumbled upon a good selection in helen ga over the weekend i will definitely buy again which might require another trip
6272,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.09,this classic has a roasted malt and dark fruit flavor that is quite nice
6273,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.32,purity mien frauline this is like of you took shiner bock and sent them to finishing school lightly roasty and malty with the sweetness of a dirty brown flower the germans overengineer their beer and their cars you could give this to a newborn is good yah
6274,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.36,aroma of roasty malt and chocolate and a body that follows closely  a refreshing wave of roasted malt chocolate some hickory and spice followed by sweeter cloying chocolate and honey on the back end a great dark beer
6275,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.56,poured from a one pint 09 fl oz bottle into a ritzenhoff cylindrical mug bottle date code is 5402  l dark deep reddish amber color  s deep roasted caramel malt  t sweet caramel and pumpernickel  f incredibly smooth slightly dry finish moderate carbonation  o an absolutely fantastic doppelbock
6276,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.45,500ml bottle in mae kasa thailand pours a deep cola brown with a medium head aroma of caramel banana liqorice roasted malt taste of banana caramel dark fruit chocolate coffee and nuts complex interesting intriguing impressive a fine doppelbock
6277,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,3.95,l very dark brown frothy tan head that dissipates quickly s caramel brown sugar hints of molasses and dark fruit t nothing surprising given the smell heavy on the sweet toasted malt notes of plum and spice fairly sweet f mediumheavy body moderate carbonation somewhat warm finish also a bit syrupy and sticky  its pretty good and has well developed flavors although its almost a bit too sweet for my taste
6278,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.41,the beer is a dark redbrown color small quickly dissipating tan head no lace aroma of dark fruit and sweet malt taste of molasses plum and raisin a little more than mediumbodied very drinkable
6279,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.22,appearance poured with barely a feathers worth of head that dissipated immediately the body though deep dark rich brown when held to the light shows thin but steady carbonation  smell predominantly caramel malt but with notes of toffee and a fruit backbone as plum molasses and maybe a hint of pumpernickel bread is present needs a bit warming but still decently potent upon pour  taste rich rich malt as caramel toffee plum and molasses start us off that sugary molasses permeates the beer as notes of raisins nut and i think even a mild rum note come in before we end on a fairly nondescript slight bitter note that ending is really the only thing holding back the perfect score and that it is just a little bit too rich still decadent  mouthfeel aftertaste is a next mix of malt molasses and rum raisin carbonation is a bit too low for my liking as i think some creaminess could add something to this the transitioning is wonderful as it shifts seamlessly  drinkability the body is certainly on the thicker side of medium body but the low carbonation here means it settles down incredibly well it doesnt quite disguise its abv with that rum note and it certainly pushes its weight around but it does it in a good way  final thoughts i love weihenstephaner ironically the only thing they brew that i wouldnt say is exceptional but is still solid is their standard hefeweizen which is what they are probably most known for this to me shows they dont necessarily need to stick to wheat to produce something awesome you really cant go wrong with this brewer
6280,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.62,pours a dark caramel color and has looks to have lots of carbonation by the bubbles during the pour the head is foamy but subsides quickly  the smell is amazing similar to caramel but there is a distinct smell that is fainly fruity it almost smells like sugary baked apples there is a slight booziness  the flavor is great if you can stomach a bit of booziness there is rich malty flavor like caramel toffee and toasted bread very low in bitterness and not overly sweet there is a tinge of coffeetoffee in the aftertaste  the mouthfeel isnt particularly thick or particularly syrupy it has a good malty balance  an exceptional beer overall one of my favorites
6281,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.55,what was once an easy find is now one of the rarest treats in the brewing industry this ale is the pinnacle of the spicy floral piney hop character that old school sierra nevada ipas exhibit a deep burnt sugar crystal malt flavor balances the hop bite of this old school classic no one makes beer like this anymore i would take this over a tropical fruit bomb 910 times
6282,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.23,a pours orange amber body with small white head with ok retention and lacing s slight malty and earthy hopness t earthy hop notes with a balanced sweet biscuity taste slight vanilla aftertaste m medium bodied and slightly crisp and refreshing o nice feel and taste combo pretty good overall
6283,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.43,it is a beautiful pour from a tap into a clear pint glass dark copperamber in color it also brings with it a modest and enduring light biege head its mildly aromatic with solid earthy and malty notes that also describes the flavor which is malty enough to provide a little sweetness and a decent body the hops add flavor without being overly bitter this is truly a wet hopped ipa earthy throughout the drinking experience even the finish doesnt approach the expected ipa hoppy dryness not that this lacks a good bitter hop inclusion its there just well balanced by a really good malt body
6284,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,3.76,look brown brown brown copper and with ample carbonation and a white head transparent smellnonexistent light hop citrus with some maltiness tasteresinous  slick peppery but none of the kind of fresh hop experience that lagunitas has with their wet hop good but for me very reminiscent of celebration in taste and color feela carbonation that dictates the bitterness in the back end very nice much lacing overallthis is a nice beer but get a lot of the same notes from celebration fresh hop and there are many sierra beverages i like a little more they are a victim of all of their previous successes its good why not try it
6285,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.25,i had this many years ago i remember it being excellent a great balance of hops and malt one of the most well balanced ipas ive had
6286,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,3.75,355 ml bottle vintage 2015 in nevada city amber to copper colour large white head pleasant aroma of fresh hops herbal and fruity notes the flavour is also well hopped throughout but the bitterness is not extreme for an ipa a very decent and enjoyable beer
6287,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.19,sierra nevada came through with just what the beer dr ordered for my jangled nerves i wholly appreciate how this dank herbal brew is kind of the opposite of so many ipas on the scene here in the pnw it has a pretty substantial caramel malty backbone that is distinctive like ruebens but less marmalade the sweetness is mellowed by the bitterness but its not too resinous thick but far from watery either somehow this abv is perfect for a nice buzz but way more sessionable than many ipas out maybe thats a good thing if your planning a hangout outside with your buds this herbalmalt profile also seems more aligned with this winter season so theres another positive point i did get this on tap so im not sure if id appreciate this as much if it sat around for more than a month and several weeks in the shelves at this price it would be hard to pass if i was looking to purchase a pony keg for the man cave
6288,Crest Super Premium Lager,2.95,canned in a big old tallboy crafty craft can and purchased from the local minimart on petersfield avenue aroma is golden syrup flavour is slightly dry with some maple
6289,Crest Super Premium Lager,3.06,drinking this from a can cant comment on the look  smell is pretty nonexistant to my nose little bit of fruit lemon not bad not great  taste is syrupy and sweet with more lemony flavours and a bitterness that creeps up as you swallow not really complex but not terrible no sight of those finest german aromatic hops though more just bitterness without flavour honestly i dont hate it could be more complex or backed up with hops but besides being a bit cloyingly sweet it really is not bad  mouth feel is syrupy kind of thick because of the sweetness not dry although there is bitterness which develops on the finish  overall  i dont hate it like a lot of people on here is it excellent highbrow beer no but for what it is it honestly isnt terrible not too much liquor forward in my opinion tastes strong but not 10 i would like some more hops and flavour besides the sweetness some orange or grapefruit would balance that not great but not terrible if you want a buzz for cheap go for it and its better than the average american pissinacan any day
6290,Crest Super Premium Lager,4.33,love the nose on opening taste was quite what i expected so many haters perhaps they are light beer drinkers due to the high alcohol content i wont be drinking it often however i will pick up the odd can in future love a malt forward beer
6291,Crest Super Premium Lager,2.02,some really horrid stuff but the drain drank most of it
6292,Crest Super Premium Lager,1,the reviews of this beer are hilarious i cant add much crest super is pretty awful stuff this is why its not a good idea to produce a high alcohol lager eku28 comes to mind syrupy cloying flavors and not good flavors i have found that cutting this with half water makes it drinkable i have this around in case i run out of ale that i brew it gets things started quickly if you know what i mean its basically a malt liquor for white people attention commercial brewers it is much easier and less expensive to brew a high alcohol ale that tastes great than to attempt the same with a lager why are you not pursuing this there is a market for a wonderful high alcohol alein a can do it still i would probably keep this around for emergencies just add water for drinkability
6293,Crest Super Premium Lager,4.66,my favourite beer
6294,Crest Super Premium Lager,2.27,500ml can a sort of surprise new offering from the wells  youngs group to suddenly show up here in alberta for the second time it would appear the finest german aroma hops eh wtf was this actually made in the country that originated the english language  this beer pours a clear bright medium golden amber colour with two chubby fingers of puffy rocky and bubbly eggshell white head which leaves some splendid bonsai tree forest lace around the glass as it quickly abates  it smells of sickly sweet apples and pears gritty caramel malt yeasty rising bread lemon furniture polish and some strangely stanky um strange ok hops i suppose but man are they musky the taste is gritty and grainy caramel well flavouring dead yeast cells pome fruitheavy yukaflux further near gaginducing industrial alcohol warming notes and a distinct lack of the finest of german hops never to be seen in a shit show like this  the bubbles are quite underwhelming in their barely perceptible frothiness the body a soso middleweight as if buoyed by some unfamiliar sugar source and not really all that smooth not with that pithy cheapass booziness loafing about it finishes still pretty sweet but all tainted here and musty and deadseeming there gah  yeah this is not a craft brew by any stretch of the imagination which is a bit of a shame given the predilections of the parent brewing concern courage bombardier etc but it is a partystarter or ender depending on ones constitution i presume  euro malt liquor swill incarnate oh and i have to apologize for my opening generalizing tirade about the english  we have shitty supposedly educated marketing people over here too
6295,Crest Super Premium Lager,2.05,well its fairly rank stuff but lets be honest you buy this to get a buzz on the cheap ive been there and i will say you could do worse alcohol is omnipresent in this one yet it remains drinkable not really worth further elaboration but if your buying this and expecting exceptional taste aroma or profiles your doing it wrong d
6296,Crest Super Premium Lager,1.98,500 ml can picked up at tbs best before june 19 2016 and served ice cold this is a beer that i have intentionally avoided for nearly 10 years now but i was feeling masochistic tonight  pours a clear golden colour capped off with one inch of frothy white head it seeps away steadily over the next five minutes or so eventually thinning out into a foamy cap and collar good lacing too  visually this is a rather attractive lager but aromatically id have to argue otherwise corn syrup alcohol wet cardboard boiled vegetables and apples all come to mind but quality lager most certainly does not to quote a certain fictitious news anchor i immediately regret this decision  not quite as awful as id anticipated but still one of the worst beers ive had in years very saccharine with flavours of corn syrup and cotton candy dominating at first this is surprisingly enough countered by some weedy grassy hop extract bitterness but the truly offputting aftertaste totally blots out that faint beam of light little effort has gone into masking the alcohol content which is noticeable throughout the sip  but it really reaches its climax after you swallow a gulp at that point this beer begins to taste the way that compost water and paint thinner smell lightmedium in body with appropriately assertive carbonation levels the alcohol burn is so significant that it almost seems to have a numbing effect on the tongue  final grade 198 a miserable f crest super premium lager is more of a fraternity hazing supply or a solvent than a beer in fact it is easily one of the worst alcoholic beverages that i can recall consuming over the past decade  and consume i did all the way to the bottom of the can because im just that stubborn crest is shamelessly boozy and i would judge no man or woman for pouring this swill down the drain if you are drinking this simply to get drunk and really why else would you be prove that you have more self respect than me and buy yourself a mickey of whiskey or rum or something
6297,Crest Super Premium Lager,1,tastes like ass
6298,Crest Super Premium Lager,1.22,easily the worst beer ive ever had
6299,Crest Super Premium Lager,2.7,theres actually a bit of hop flavour here but mostly boozy corn
6300,Crest Super Premium Lager,3.02,non drinkin bud light morons rate this beer low so be it ya want a kick drink this beer nasty by itself yes but i cut it 13 by 23 with another 5 lager have 4 or 5 your in buzztown babyi dont drink vodka anymore  ya want a kick it up a notch this beer is the way to go  screw the foofoo beer puritans as william wallace stated freedom
6301,Laker Ice Premium Lager,1.85,youre drinking this to get drunk not to enjoy a quality beer  it tastes like slightly malty water goes down nice and smooth no real complaints here but youd be hard pressed to find any real endorsements either  make no mistake this is a shit beer you buy for the alcohol content and nothing more however as shit beers bought solely for their alcohol content go this one goes hard my number 1 recommendation for broke college students
6302,Laker Ice Premium Lager,1,the only people i ever see buying this obviously want to save 25c per can it is not worth the savings because this beer is horrid just spend more and drink something good if i could give this less than 1 i would
6303,Laker Ice Premium Lager,2.53,l transparent light yellow some bubbles minimal head s sweet slightly skunky adjunct lager smell some fruity apple notes t slightly sweet a bit dry and bitter not too flavorful but also not too bland a bit balanced towards the toasted malts with a slight skunky hop note the alcohol is a bit detectable f medium carbonation and light bodied a bit drying o drinkable but not very enjoyable will have to see how this compares to their lager offering for determining the best cheapest beer
6304,Laker Ice Premium Lager,3.25,pours gold coloured and crystal clear not no head to speak of the smell is all biscuit the taste is also all biscuit this is a bare bones basic beer and is priced accordingly dec 14 2020
6305,Laker Ice Premium Lager,1.71,poured from a 473ml can  decent appearance with full white head but taste is sweet adjuncts and very off putting tastes fake and manufactured not sure how someone can go through a whole can of this
6306,Laker Ice Premium Lager,3.25,good cheap beer for canada  this one of the last independent brewers please support the little guy without them we only lower the competition and our selection ultimately  a golden goodness beer  s beerie goodness  t typical north american beer flavor  m same as above  o good cheap beer  thx for reading
6307,Laker Ice Premium Lager,2,a  pours a pale golden colour no head and no lacing  s  sweet corn grains apple juice and a bit of honey on the finish  t  same as the nose sweet corn grainy malts lots of apple juice with a hint of sour cider and corn syrop on the finish  m  thin and watery with a wet finish  o  theres a reason this is 185 a tall can nothing special here not worthy and a waste of a twoonie
6308,Laker Ice Premium Lager,2.9,does the job honestly this is a mass produced lager it honestly isnt that bed it isnt that great it is a go to beer when you want something that honestly doesnt make you think more then you just want another beer apparently i need to say more and more and more and more i have nothing more to say so i am blah blah blahing right now is this enough word to describe a run of the mill ice lager
6309,Natural Light,4,i dont get the hate not gonna go into detail and give it an indepth review heres my common cheap light lager ranking instead busch light
6310,Natural Light,2.17,this beer is easily the most tasteless beer ive ever tried ive had other beers with less abv that had more flavor seems kind of silly to opt for this weak offering when there are many other better light beer choices that cost about the same
6311,Natural Light,2.92,a perennial classic natural light evokes feelings of belonging and good times it is the habit of the fool to judge a book by its prose grammatical correctness or coherent story the learned man forms his judgement of its value based on how it makes them feel deep inside a book that makes me feel good i could read 1520 times in one day i can delete 1520 nattys colloquial term in a day it makes me feel good
6312,Natural Light,2.1,from a 12oz can  appearance clear pale yellow ok head at first fades out quickly  smell vague haygrass first then vague sweet fruitiness  taste remains vague following the smell kind of light cracker taste i suppose very light bodied its light beer  overall had to pick up a 12 of the retro label to review natty light is infamous where i went to college iowa state due to the basketball coach larry eustachy being pictured among coeds from the u of missouri drinking said beverage natty is slightly better than bud light but has very little flavor so ill continue to pick up miller lite or coors light when i want a light beer
6313,Natural Light,1.7,awful
6314,Natural Light,2.58,not sure what to say about this beer it basically has no aroma little color no decent beer flavor to speak of so i guess the carbonation and mouthfeel is akin to beer but aside from that theres nothing else to report it doesnt get any lighter than natural light its definitely crisp and refreshing so if you enjoy beer flavored carbonated water then this is your beer
6315,Natural Light,2.5,absurdly drinkable crisp clean cold and refreshing natural light is a good lager with a touch of bitterness and sweetness it remains flavorful despite the fact that it is a light beer 50100
6316,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.29,750ml waxed and capped bottle into a ddg teku  pours thick viscous no head no lace big mocha colored legs spice and cinnamon sugar are apparent on the nose also notes of chocolate fudge molasses and booze very pungent beer opens chocolate fudge and cinnamon sugar spicy and prickly vanilla and barrel in the middle oak booze and more molasses and fudge at the end sticky finish body is full with low carbonation smooth and rich on the palate and goes down messy with a lingering aftertaste  im actually less of a fan of this than other imperial stouts in perennials barrel aged series that being said still far better than average
6317,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.4,excellent rye barrel with strong taste of cinnamon hints of cocoa nibs ancho and vanilla are pushed into the background by the barrel flavor which dominates the other flavors it is very good but personally i slightly prefer the greater nuance of the regular abraxis
6318,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.61,cinnamon and pepper the predominant notes cocoa and the barrel aged bourbon sweetness add on the balance the spiciness very well done adjuncted ba stout
6319,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.13,good not noticeably better than normal abraxas id say overly sweet per style and too mich cinnamon 3 beer on beer advocate lmao no  okay fuck the more i drink this the more i can barely finish the 9oz pour sugar cinnamon water cloying and way fucking 2 dimensional and cloying

6322,Supplication,3.73,375ml corktopped bottle bottled on 020823 barrel aged 9 to 15 months pinor noir barrels with cherries served in my new stemless cbc glass brillian ruby color with excellent clarity and little head formation mild aroma suggests a bit of tartness flavor brings on a lot of that tartness approaching outright sour but has a delicious ripe cherry flavor which complements the brett nicely sharp carbonation is suitable here  if i was more into sours i might find this outstanding i find it more drinkable than cerise cass√©e and i really appreciate the balance here unfortunately for me its a balance between sour brett and sweet cherries not so much the oak and the brown ale underneath that id be more interested in
6323,Supplication,4.44,this pours out copper a bit of haze minimal head and no lacing nose is a punchy vinegar note wine barrel and fruit beneath flavor is a less aggressive presentation of the nose with cherry and full red wine elements melding into the strong acidity the wildness also comes through as a counter to the acidity putting some earthiness and funk on the back end well built and delicious
6324,Supplication,2.11,i couldnt get into this one the taste was all over the place and a bit too sour for my tastes carbonation and head was good sad because i really wanted to like this
6325,Supplication,2.4,bottled in 2014 poured into a tulip glass this beer has way too much going on almost like they tried to creat so many flavor profiles it ended up just tasting like a mess not very drinkable thus not very enjoyable
6326,Supplication,4.21,bottled 7217 and received courtesy of dimidiata fairly clear amber color coming out of the bottle settling to a deeper semitranslucent caramel once in the glass the aroma initially struck me as typical wild brett funk but upon closer inspection the cherry and wine barrel notes revealed themselves in a pleasantly discreet way  taste is wonderfullydifferent this is unlike any beer i can recall in recent memory the cherries are remarkably present after 5 years but the wine barrel combined with the earthy funk is whats really making this one interesting plenty of sweet malts up front but then the funk emerges midpalate and into the aftertaste fairly full bodied and lightly carbonated  overall very interesting and very good beer
6327,Broccoli,4.31,canned 81023 brewed in brooklyn  l pours a hazy dark gold with a short creamy sticky white head thin irregular lacing  s muted aromas of orange mango and grapefruit  t peach and mango up front some citrus orange and lemon in the middle finishes very pleasantly dry with some bitterness  f medium mouthfeel medium to low carbonation  o nice transition from tropical to citrus then a sharp pivot to a drybitter almost west coast finish
6328,Broccoli,3.53,not sure why the called it broccolibut this is a good neipa no worries there in no leafy green in here just a very good tasting hazy
6329,Broccoli,4.42,16 ounce can canned on 06072023 served in a chalice the beer pours a hazy gold color with about an inch offwhite head head retention and lacing are both pretty good i like the aroma the brew smells like pineapple mango grapefruit orange and white grapes for the most part i think the taste is similar to the aroma but theres also some pear dankearthy and honeydew melon flavors noticeable too mostly tropical fruity tasting to me mouthfeelbody is medium its coating and a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation i thought this was a pretty good overall brew certainly worth trying if you get the chance
6330,Broccoli,4.28,had fresh can finally trying an iconic oh brew appealing look and feel tasty in a somewhat average oh neipa style with bit of dank came across as more ipa than imperial ipa glad i tried but this far into the game it didnt wow will see how other 3 cans go down over time
6331,Broccoli,3.66,i get a pineapple citrus smell and taste with a hint of the white grape that the label might be talking about aftertaste i do taste hints of mango really like what other half does only have had the cabbage prior maybe its almost the same i dont know but its a good beer
6332,Presidente Light,2.32,not bad if you are sitting on the beach
6333,Presidente Light,3.16,poured from a bottle into a pint glass appearance  the beer pours a clear straw color with a small head of white foam the head fades fast leaving a tiny bit of lace on the sides of the glass smell  the aroma is strongest of a caramel smell mixed with a touch of bread and hay there is a tiny bit of grain and bay on there as well taste  the taste begins with a sweet corn syrup and caramel taste with a little bit of bread and cracker toward the end of the taste some light herb and hay come to the tongue mouthfeel  the body of the brew is light with a carbonation level that is average for the style the feel is good and makes for an easy drinker overall  nothing great but it is an easy drinking beach beer
6334,Presidente Light,3.63,i would like to point out that it is against site policy to call out other raters in a negative fashion by the same token i would like to give my eternal thanks to my local inperson trader tone77 for his massive recent dropoff that included this beer i was astounded by how much beer he brought for me  shamed by the fact that mine was merely a paltry offering 8 i must atone to tone77   from the bottle his dropoff his call presidente light pilsener style beer  as i was prising the cap off of the bottle for an eventual pop i noticed a number of carbonation bubbles beginning to appear good i like a wellcarbonated beer my followup slow gentle cline pour still resulted in the formation of twoplus fingers of foamy soapy rocky bonewhite head with very good retention color was yellowgold srm  4  5 with nequality clarity just deep enough to entice the gelt gang of mammon croesus  midas to drop in for a taste nose had a pronounced cereallike graininess but not much in the way of either hops or unwanted adjuncts hmm mouthfeel was thintomedium on the big side for a lager the taste was sweet mildly of perhaps  corn but the fact that it was nearly unidentifiable was a bonus it was a little too sweet  malty for my taste but certainly well within specs for this style i was rather impressed that it came across so well coming from a green glass  bottle finish was semisweet bordering on semidry again more sweet than i would have liked but not bad overall as far as a steady diet of it might be concerned i could see tiring of it fairly quickly ymmv
6335,Presidente Light,3.39,poured from a green 12 oz bottle has a golden color with a 12 inch head smell is of light grains taste is malts grains highly refreshing feels mediumlight bodied in the mouth and overall i found it to be more flavorful and enjoyable than many in this style
6336,Presidente Light,3.25,65 yo soy dominicano
6337,Presidente Light,3.69,i was at an allinclusive resort in the dominican republic the only beer they had was el presidente and el presidente light and because it was allinclusive there was no charge for the beers and the beers were everywhere every room had a minifridge stocked with sodas water and el presidente there was a bar everywhere every pool had a bar there were three bars on the beach every restaurant had a bar the main building had three different bars when we checked it there was a bar right there at the check in and at every bar the only beer they had was el presidente and el presidente light  and i was loving it one day i had ten beers before lunch i was drinking so much beer that i decided to switch to el presidente light because it has a lower alcohol rate and it was easier on the gi system this will always be among my favs
6338,Presidente Light,3,from a green bottle it pours a clear light yellow color smell and taste had notes of floral lemon grass with cornrice and malts mouth feel crisp but watered downice cold on the beach this one is ok

6340,Carib Ginger Shandy,3.01,275 ml bottle from a sixpack purchased at the lcbo best before aug 2023 and listed at 09 served slightly chilled  pours crystal clear goldenyellow stirring up a thin layer of bubbly suds that barely qualifies as a head within thirty seconds it has sizzled away leaving the surface utterly barren  no lace either the aroma is sweet smelling mainly of candied ginger and sugar not much going on but its appealing enough  the flavour profile is similar  theres no depth whatsoever but since its also palatable im not too inclined to complain about a 09 shandy lacking complexity sugary sweet at the forefront with notes of ginger spiciness giving way to a sweeter candied gingerlike flavour on the back end maybe a hint of caramelized sugars and grainy malts but sugary ginger is the main takeaway the aftertaste is a little sweet light in body with crisp prickly carbonation that complements its ginger flavours nicely its refreshing and effortlessly easy to knock back  final grade 301 a c my most common complaint about ginger beers is that they dont have enough of a bite to them and sadly caribs ginger shandy is no exception that being said if i were sitting on a caribbean beach in the summer i think id be quite content with this very basic ginger beer its acceptable and not much more than that  i might buy another sixpack mostly because its nice to have a functionally nonalcoholic brew in the back of the fridge for afternoon refreshment and also because there arent many other real ginger beers to pick from around here
6341,Carib Ginger Shandy,3.37,12 oz clear bottle 09 alcvol code 09 15 am 20024 purchased single off shelf poured into a fat tulip  polishedclear gold liquid foam disappears in seconds basically candiedcrystallized ginger on the nose just about the same on the palate  candied ginger marginally ginger beer aftertaste mellowmoderate spicy bitterness however caramel sweetness holds momentarily before fading away so its not too terribly sweetish somewhat flat in fizz roundish but short of viscous flavorful enough but also arguably bland could use a bit more spicy acidic zip to achieve more balance with the dull sweet lull liquid diluted candy more alcopop than beermaltbev more or less 1711
6342,Carib Ginger Shandy,1.85,original review from october 19 2004  i finally tried the ginger version of this it has a light tan ginger ale color to it some foam forms but it fizzes instantly away like soda the aroma is sugary sweet and gingery with a mouthfeel much like ginger ale the flavor is sweet and gingery it isnt as intense as a ginger beer but still has a tiny bit more burn than a ginger ale the aftertaste has some ginger flavor lingering along with some bready notes the only beerllike characteristic i detected no alcoholic warmth to finish it out  this is basically alcoholic ginger ale it was much better than the bright red sorrel version but it is still more alcopop than beer i could actually imagine drinking this as a refreshing beverage unlike the cloying sorrel version
6343,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.13,transparent pinkish blonde body with a small broken head big time ginger aroma sugary sweet some vanilla notes lots of ginger too sweet for me no way i could drink much of this headache
6344,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.63,a the beer is clear yellow in color it poured with a short white head that quickly died down and completely faded away s moderate aromas of ginger are present in the nosejust like you were sniffing the fresh ginger that you get as an accompaniment to sushi t much like smell the taste has lots of moderate flavors of ginger neither sweetness nor bitterness are perceptible m it feels lightbodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation o this beer tastes like a ginger ale without the sweetness it is quite flavorful for a shandy
6345,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.44,330ml single bottle procured at my favorite downmarket bottleshop in etown  this beer pours a clear pale golden amber colour with one i think finger of fizzy sodapop head which predictably wisps away just as fast as you can look at it leaving nothing resembling lace near the glass  it smells of sharp edgy and duly spicy ginger root middling caramel notes and a gritty sugarcane sweetness the taste is much more of the same  rather sweet syrupy sugar tinted with a burnt carameltoffee essence still perky and peppy natural spicy ginger an echo of actual indistinct malt and a mild herbal astringency very much like those caribbean bitters  the bubbles are barely adequate more like the kind that remain in a bottle of cola left in the fridge for three days the body a deceptive medium weight as all that extra sugar has to go somewhere it finishes well sweet in a rather saccharine sense the ginger holding on much as it would in the associated soft drink  yeah yeah yeah this is sweet like soda low alcohol and yet pretty gingery this all may be a bit confusing but id take this in a heartbeat over any actual ginger ale as all other things being equal the minor abv and heady ginger root notes make this a winner a winner for canadian grocery stores that is and not as a lager beer as theyve so brazenly plastered on the label
6346,Carib Ginger Shandy,1.55,12 oz bottle poured into pint glass  a pours very very light yellow good finger and a 12 of white head that settles to nothing no lacing at all looks very flat no carbonation at all  s ginger ale a little caramel and lots of sweet sugar is this beer   t just like the smell straight up ginger ale hint of caramel very sweet not beer like at all  m light bodied no carbonation but leaves a sugary sticky feel in the mouth  d lets be honest this is not a beer it is ginger ale with a touch of alcohol run away
6347,Saison Bernice,4.54,somehow eluding me for over a decade despite several trades with sara locals my first draft pour at good vibes 2023 appears lightly hazy maize yelloworange with a dense khaki foam blanket that retains well  this exhibits a surprisingly solid funk thats as if oaked as well as some aged cheese thats cut by an apricotlemon tartness accented by a refreshing hint of lime  the fairly crisp body finishes just dry in the swallow  i can see why this is so wellregarded
6348,Saison Bernice,4.52,superb appearance in the glassbright golden yellow color with extremely fine delicate white head aromas of brett lemon and grassy hay taste is a burst of lemony tartness and funk a very light delicate mouthfeel with spritzy carbonation just about a perfect saison in my book
6349,Saison Bernice,4.21,poured from a capped 750ml bottle into my troubadour tulip  nearly clear arylide yellow body with a steady stream of microbubbles off white cap disappears rapidly almost no lacing nor legs  subtle complex yeastdriven aromatics suffused with poolish fresh cut hay and stone fruit floral with a whisper of white winechampagne  bright with a balance of light grainmalt tart meyer lemonunripe pear and a faint pepperybarnyard edge from the brett light clean bitterness with a touch of alfalfa and clover long mediumdry finish reveals full maturation and synergy of ingredients  a bit thin and fizzy with lingering acidity what meager roundness is present seems almost but not quite chalky  excellent aroma and flavor a core expression from the brewery but the body is more like a lambic than a saison  perhaps this was not a great bottlebatch but at the price point im not eager to roll the dice again right away
6350,Saison Bernice,4.7,brief review  o my first sara beer here very lucky to grab this from sf on a trip this past april been hearing a lot of great things about them for years really digging this very clean light complex just a slight funk not overly tart great carbonation and mouthfeel dont have much to compare it to from the brewery but as far as saisons and wild ales go this is certainly top notch  recommendation definitely on par with some things ive had from hf this is a really good beer from an awesome brewery
6351,Yanjing Beer,1.36,bought at liquor shed  pours a pale gold with nearly a finger of foam lacing is very good  the smell is umm of rotten vegetables with a sickly sweet aroma and smells light struck  the taste is a nasty grainy sweetness vegetal non goodness plain terrible  thin and watery body  yeah it is a single bottle that i bought
6352,Yanjing Beer,3.94,poured from 12ounce bottle into a stemmed glass goblet crystalclear pale amber with a couple of fingers of snowwhite head that left some nice lacing as it settled comforting aromas of grain grass and tart apple that obtain on the palate as well the light malt provides good structure and there is an unexpected but pleasant umami note however slight fairly light bodied good carbonation clean finish overall an excellent euro pale lager i wish i had me some chinese food right about now 
6353,Yanjing Beer,2.82,found this at binnys on its buildyourown 6pack shelf and had been there for a couple of months not likely to return i wanted to try it and i did and i wont again unless i can find it fresh while yanjing has a decent personality i had it next to off colors si fang designed for dumplings on a relative basis yanjing just lacked flavor i suppose designed for refreshment but not as a contributor to the kitchen  to be consistent i owe yanjing one of my micro reviews but ill keep it short i couldnt find the english button so i only could review some superficial macro marketing hence below average overall rating
6354,Yanjing Beer,2.86,cool to run into a bunch of random new to me asian lagers last week i have long been a fan of the international lager experimentation game much as these are all the same they also all have their own little personalities and quirks and its fun to drink through them in life this one is very light close to ruined in the nose from the green glass not my favorite packaging decision but who knows if this was ever meant by the brewery to land in idaho a long way from home to be sure its immediately frothy and very well carbonated practically leaping out of the bottle which is appealing past the skunkiness its got a simple cereal grain base seems like all malt nothing cheap or extractesque about it not even metallic either which so many of these are and i can appreciate a little continental ale yeast this almost has czech pils elements to it in grain and yeast the faintest herbal hop and balancing finish enough to be quenching and crisping if this were fresh but alas it is not oxidized and with wet paper character still its oddly clean on the swallow it goes away fast but its skunky enough to be a bit unappealing even when its frosty cold cool to get to try this one the malt character and its effervescence are its best features but i like it having a touch of body too and dont mind trace grain sweetness perhaps better than most when its nice and fresh hope to try it that way next time
6355,Yanjing Beer,4.88,i had this beer in china and it was my personal favourite liked it better than the other chinese beers easy drinking and nice and strong its typically drunk when youre eating spicy asian food the general reason is that it helps to clear the palate in a refreshing hydrating way so you can move on to the next spicy dish thats probably the reason why its so popular in china especially for chinese food banquets so if youre having spicy asian food you really cannot go wrong with this beer it is in my opinion a hidden gem that i was glad to discover
6356,Yanjing Beer,3.39,i normally do not do lagers but this one was pretty good its complex and has a sweetness or fruitiness i couldnt peg id get again
6357,Yanjing Beer,3.38,12oz bottle from brewers haven very pale gold with a nice tight rocky head lots of lacing grainy malty aroma some corn taste is sweet and more grainy flavors and lacking any vegetal notes you usually get with cheap lagers tasty smooth light
6358,Yanjing Beer,3.83,lets be real the beer is what it is im not going to call it a chinese heineken but it still isnt gonna win me over like kiera knighlty in a nightie what i like is that my homeboy down the street at the liquor store told me to put it in the freezer for 20 minutes before i pop it and you know what i got ice cold nothing which is better than regular cold skunk  ill drink to that  honestly i kind of like it
6359,Yanjing Beer,3.44,decanted from an 112 oz 330 ml bottle into a custom taster pint no production information a pours a crystal clear straw to golden color with a two finger foamy white head decent retention but spotty lacing at first although it picks up lower on the glass s peppery and toasty with grainy especially corn and grassy aromas t semidry fruity apple and corn and very lightly malty with a surprising degree of bitterness given the style and area of origination m light bodied with very solid carbonation drinks smoothly crisply and cleanly o this is a solidly constructed lager without being stand out it is no longer in the clear bottle as depicted above but rather in a green one which is no improvement from the perspective of skunking the absence of a production date is a problem especially as it is an import and trying hard to penetrate the american market
6360,Yanjing Beer,2.44,pours a clear medium yellow that resolves to faint lacing smell is fairly strong sweet corn malt taste is skunky sweet corn malt and slightly bitter finish
6361,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.5,everything here is as expected cloudy gold with a small head citrus aroma and flavors medium sweetness with a bit of bitterness but very solid depth of flavor close to amazing for something you can find on a shelf in many places
6362,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.19,on tap at monks in sioux falls sd  a well balance but very ugly beer do not miss this one 425  a  pours an opaque chalky yellow almost like one of those fruited sours maybe the ugliest ipa i have ever seen  s  but i loved the sedate almost not therebut there aroma citra singular slightly fruity slightly resiny but not over hopped with respect to rest of the beer 425  t  some minor chalkiness but balance by a good intense resiny hoppiness so much so that i had some back of the throat irritation 425  mf  medium body with an almost acrid finish dry but a hint of sweetness 425
6363,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.65,pretty fresh 12 oz can in a chilled pint glass not too much head but nice a little colder than idea really nice beer hoppy for a pale true as advertised for a double nice lemony finish very smooth very drinkable think ill have another
6364,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.4,chilled pint can into a pint glass hazy fruity juicy the citra hop shines and its slightly bitter great to get ahold of this one totally enjoyed may i have another please
6365,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.29,a  pours a bright orange with a two finger fizzy white head light soapy lacing  s  aroma is pineapple orange lemon and resinous hops  t  the taste is candied lemon pineapple orange peel grapefruit and a long lingering hop bite  m  medium body with medium carbonation creamy mouthfeel with a soft crisp finish  o  solid
6366,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.77,brief review  o holy shit this beer is good that was my first thought i honestly didnt go into this with much expectation other than i knew id at leas like it since its tg and a sue beer i didnt love pseudosue nor the galaxy dryhopped version thought they were just okay and potentially overhyped havent had either in several years but once i cracked this i could tell right away it was special hazebomb in the glass huge pineapple and mango aromas mouthfeel and finish is super rich and juicy this is honestly up there with some of the tree house hazys i had back in the day also didnt know this was a top 150 beer until i looked it up and i have to say its deserves every ounce of the praise  recommendation a surprisingly great extra hoppy edition of the classic pseudosue this is by far the best in the line musttry and not terribly hard to get either
6367,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.42,best little bro of the king sue
6368,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.42,this is a neipa by all measures these days so rating as such clearly nothing in common with zombie dust or snpa regardless pours a beautiful opaque aromas and mouthfeel are a bit sharper than anticipated but the citra flavors are yummy for certain glad i finally found this one
6369,Blatz Beer,4.05,thought it was gonna be terrible like i remember it to be last time i drunk it out of a returnable case 14 years ago was pleasantly surprised that it was refreshing and has a nice little kick to it much better than expected  my usual go to beer miller genuine draft is getting harder and harder to find this is also 2 cheaper per case only drawback is ill never find it on vacation in las vegas
6370,Blatz Beer,3.49,remember the heavy returnable cases local store had this in stock with those that looked the same as those from the early 90s just had to get one for old times sake just a basic beer to have on a saturday afternoon no complaints
6371,Blatz Beer,3.47,please delete if you choose to do so trigger warning the last time i drank a delicious can of blatz beer was around 1979 so in some respects this review is for historical reasons only  my local beer shop on state street in madison wisconsin sold blatz way back when i bought several 12 packs over the course of a few months and walked home 2 to 3 miles with the 12pack on my shoulder back to my apartment on spring street  back then blatz was a welcome alternative to the national and regional beers available at the time it wasnt promoted or expected to be allstar or world class just a solid brew that you might prefer to old style schmidt miller etc  all good things come to an end after 810 sixpacks i got tired of the taste and moved on to other brews i remember the store clerk telling me that they had blatz beer on sale for xx dollars didnt matter i was tired of the beer
6372,Blatz Beer,3.66,blatz is a well rounded beer that goes down easy under rated i believe because of its limited availability
6373,Blatz Beer,3.46,hard to find around me  usually pick it up at reisbacks in zanesville oh  my uncles drank the hell out of this back in the 80s  kind of sweet an light bodied for a non lite aal just has a better taste than some of my other cheap go tos like i said  you just dont see it around central ohio everyday  and its always the cans  you never see the little brown bottles anymore
6374,Blatz Beer,3.8,pours a standard translucent gold with a fluffy white head thats thinner than expected and dissipates relatively quickly it smells slightly sweet but has a very thick barley forward smell with a hint of grassy hops and a touch of wet corny sweetness the taste is fuller than expected with a bigger malt presence than most and has a slightly hoppy edge to keep it from being sweet its thicker feeling without being thick like a schlitz or a non adjuncted lager it goes down like a light lager but its not overall the sum is greater than its parts on this one pick it up if you want to drink something youve never had before
6375,Blatz Beer,3.34,at fifty cents per can blatz is a fine covid19 lowcost adult beverage decent light lager taste good carbonation expect this to be a great summer quaff
6376,Blatz Beer,3.03,drank from a 12 ounce can scores are based on the style  look  the logo is incredibly attractive but the can as an ensemble isnt that great the silver color doesnt draw me in and the tessellated little blatz words across the can just clutter things up  smell  very faint metallic sweetness maybe some grape not much there  taste  the first thing that comes to mind is cream soda somewhat vanilla sweetness but even with its lightness it still begs for some bitterness to round it out  feel  thin body with a pleasant amount of fizz goes down quite easy  overall  i was hoping to find a new hipstery grandpa beer to love but this one is pretty lame not bad nor good i dont know when ill get back to it after this
6377,Blatz Beer,2.8,part of my old school macro rotation mouth feel is very light as is beer taste mild carbonation and very little aftertaste good summer beer  excellent on a hot day cold with a burger or sandwich can knock a bunch of these down get a cool buzz and not feel it the next day always a plus
6378,Blatz Beer,3.85,12 ounce can into lager glass best before 10142019 pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with solid retention that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers light spotty lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation good appearance aromas of cracker corn white bread dough and lightly toasted biscuit with lighter notes of wood peppercorn and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness a bit too fruity corn aromas but not overwhelming nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale maltgrains and lightmoderate earthy hop notes with solid strength taste of cracker corn white bread dough and lightly toasted biscuit with lighter notes of wood peppercorn and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness light herbal floral woody grassy peppery bitterness on the finish lingering notes of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit wood peppercorn and herbalfloralgrassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit great robustness and balance of pale maltgrains and lightmoderate earthy hop flavors with a great maltbitterness balance and no cloyingastringent flavors after the finish fairly crispclean finishing very clean on lager flavors with minimal fruityyeasty notes lightmoderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation mediumplus carbonation and lightmedium body with a very smooth moderately breadygrainy and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great zero warming alcohol as expected of 49 overall this is a delicious pale adjunct lager all around nice robustness and balance of pale maltgrains and lightmoderate earthy hop flavors very smooth crisp clean and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitterdrying finish very flavorful and not watery for the abv great clean pils maltgrain showcase with solid earthy hop presencebalance for the style not overdone on adjuncts minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness a very enjoyable offering and outstanding style example one of the better aal ive had as expected of pabst
6379,Duet,4.32,12oz can can bottom is stamped best by 041723 batch 033b mostly clear pale gold colored body one thick finger of white head but this retreats quickly to a puffy cap and ring leaves behind partial walls of lacing aroma is as advertised with pine citrus and a true note of cedar taste has a solid malt base over which hops express flavors of generic citrus and pine sweet and woody cedar also slight bitterness picks up in the aftertaste medium mouth feel with a drying aspect very good carbonation savors as a classic ipa in the west coast style
6380,Duet,4.07,pour deep yellowishorange with a white head that lingers long smells mildly of pine and citrus tastes heavily of hops but delicately balanced with sugar sweetness mouthfeel is dry and a tad too bitter overall a beer that should be a ipa standard
6381,Duet,4.06,pours a cloudy straw yellow with a thick longlasting white head that leaves generous lacing aroma is faint citrus and pine flavor is bolder than the aroma feel is medium bodied and could use a bit more carbonation imo overall a decent enough beer
6382,Duet,3.71,this episode involved emptying two twelve ounce cans into a clear glass liter mug the pours produced an overabundance of white foam on the top of a bright and light amber liquid this one is about as translucent as any beer with a reasonable color can get the aroma is mostly of hops resinous and piney in character its not particularly rich theres much less hop bite to taste than expected what is there mixes poorly with whatever starch combination was used theres an unpleasant almost soapiness to taste until the finish at least then the simcoe hops kick in and provide some clean and dry bitterness all that foam and no glass lacing bears witness that this is short on body for an alleged ipa on a positive note the 7 abv is nicely delivered that should complete the compliments
6383,Duet,3.82,appearance pours a hazy orangeyellow body with a modestlysized foamy white head light lacing  smell pulped citrus supremes pith powder stonefruit juices an unctuous drizzle of pine sap and a grassy herbaceousness  taste kicks of with a lean light biscuitinnards maltiness with things going pretty dry and pretty bitter quickly pithy citrus a charged grassy element and a touch of pnw pine resin rounded everso slightly by pineapple and peach staunchly bitter making for a nigh austerely dry potently bitter finish  mouthfeel mediumbodied medium carbonation  overall not bad
6384,Duet,4.03,golden orange with chill haze and a one finger white head nose is orange tangerine and some sugar taste follows the nose with a nice bite of grapefruit orange and tangerine pith and flesh followed by a short hint of pale malt body is light to medium with similar carbonation ends with a bitter citrus nuttiness overall not a bright as i thought it would be but solid characteristics maybe an older can cans says best by 122222 and im opening it 9222 not sure how old it is
6385,Duet,4.59,a well balanced citrusy ipa with a mixture of pine and cedar notes displays a lighter orange color with nice head and nice citrus aromas from the first sip you can taste the citrus which was soon followed by the pine this beer paired well on a warm day and was easily followed by a second exactly what i remembered from a west coast ipa
6386,Duet,4.14,really solid beer i had this one a few years back  it seems a bit different from what i remember or just what i expected in a west coast ipa but really a great beer i have rounded my overall up since my lower scores are probably more of a personal preference vs a fault with the beer i downgraded in the look and feel dept  looking hazy and feeling juicy like a neipa is not a positive for me i was hoping for a crisper feel and clearer look nonetheless i loved the foamy pour the piney smell and a real nice level of maltiness that tames the hoppyness theres no doubt i would have this again
6387,Duet,4.38,old school west coast ipa piney and bitter with some citrus elements backed up by a silky full mouthfeel pours a bright coppery orange with a thin persistent head its possibly being overrated here due to the pleasure of drinking an actual west coast ipa and the sentimentality of a beer style that first introduced me to craft beer and which i forced down in horror at the hoppy bitterness of it all  cheers
6388,Duet,3.7,very piney full ipa stronger flavor than most too much of a piney after taste for my liking 1 is enough all around the taste is good strong but the aftertaste is what lessens the score for me i am a bigger fan of the nelson and og lemon haze styles
6389,Lone Star Beer,3,on my first ever trip to the lone star state of texas to see the tallica boys i decided to pick myself up a 6pk of 16oz lone star beers from the local kroger yee haw i believe this hank hill style lager relies heavily on the texas gimmick and fair price to keep the cowboys coming back time and time again not a beer id buy regularly if it was available to me all of the time but a must if i am ever back in texas  style lager  tapcanbottle can  abv 46  rating 3
6390,Lone Star Beer,3.4,i must strongly disagree with who i call beer snobs or snooty lone star is imho much more deserving of a better score having said that here is my review  l amberstray in color with lots of streaming bubbles im giving extra points for the bottle design s grains and grass maybe a faint whiff of cracker t light and typical of an american lager there is no mistaking that this is a beer f watery and with a very faint pepper at the back of the throat o much better than a lot of the weekend beers i have had in the past id reach for a lonestar over bud or even bluemoon my only complaint is that it is very difficult to get outside of texas and louisiana luckily i have family in texas that send me some from time to time not as good as shiner but still up there in my opinion
6391,Lone Star Beer,2.17,its not great but its beer
6392,Lone Star Beer,3.31,12oz can poured into a nucleated pilsner glass the appearance is clear medium gold with 4 fingers of white head retention is average strength of aroma is medium the smell has biscuit a sweet corn adjunct smell but not as sweet as many adjunct beers a light hop smell and maybe a hint of a metallic smell strength of taste is medium taste follows aroma but drier hop bitterness is light feel is slightly above medium in thickness carbonation and astringency are low overall  being less sweet with slightly more thickness makes this better than many adjunct lagers
6393,Lone Star Beer,3.11,12 oz bottle poured into a cold 14 oz shaker by the bartender at embassy tavern in denver last night review copied from notes taken on my phone  home fries hash browns corny grain must referring to its aroma palate weird mix of corn tortilla and barley pancake feel bitter pithy bite back to taste slight touch of the hops all 35 except 40 for feel  what i can add from memory dont know what i was thinking but i gotta lower the marks for smell and taste as its initial aromas and they eventually vaped off were truly offputting aside from its introductory stench lone star is a pretty basic adjunct lager but on the lower end of its echelon only a whenintexas thing i guess 2031
6394,Lone Star Beer,3.35,drank from the can date on can dec 05 2022  other reviewers have already summed up the vibe clear yellow fizzy perhaps a bit darker than your typical american adjunct aroma is sweet grains corn bread and yeast with a bitter grassy hoppiness taste follows the nose well very reminiscent of coors for me with a clean mouthfeel and solid flavor for the style with a bit more balance than most adjuncts which tend to be too sweet i quite enjoy the body of this one its not as thin and ultra carbonated as a pabst blue ribbon actually has a tiny bit of chewiness  figured i had to try this while im living in texas and it actually slightly exceeded my expectations coors was my previously highest rated american adjunct macro and i think this one might slightly edge it out due to a better aroma but its very close this isnt something i would pick up routinely unless i was in a monetary bind as it is priced quite modestly but it certainly gets the job done most especially on a hot summer day my rating is based on style not on my personal preferences you could definitely do worse in this category cheers
6395,Lone Star Beer,4,this is just one of the beers from my past military service while i was stationed in the state of texas it was our go to beer and back then was the beer to be drinking i remember it as being great  and its before the current beer craze
6396,Lone Star Beer,5,the national beer of texas my goto
6397,Lone Star Beer,3.97,appearance pours a completely clear medium golden color iwht a bright white and soft head srm of 6 400  aroma moderate aromas of pale malts bread malts bread yeast and some corn adjuncts in the middle yeast on the finish 375  flavor moderate flavors of pale malts corn adjuncts in the middle some bread and yeast more adjuncts corn carbonation to finish  feel mediumbodied stronger carbonation a yeasty and full mouthfeel to finish  compared to miller high life 61622 pours a darker color stronger aromas more yeast bready corn adjuncts less smooth simple pale malt less carbonation and sweeter  compared to venice house lager 61622 pours a darker or paler clearer appearance more pale malt aromas less sweet biscuit more clean pale malt lighter and cleaner simpler  overall this one exceeded my low expectations nice pale bready malts and yeast here bready yeasty fullbodied and maintains a nice bread flavor im not sure why i expected less but this one dranks pretty well ill seek it out again sometime for another review rating 397
6398,Lone Star Beer,3.02,looks like a beer tastes like a beer just not a very good one like in between a classic budweiser and a busch light
6399,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3,tastes better than corona  style mexican lager  tapcanbottle bottle  abv 44  rating 35
6400,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,4.18,clear light golden beer active carbonation big fluffy head that does not stick around for long  neutral aroma very mild not much there some bread  smooth mild sweetness somewhat malty more bitterness than is typical for this style of beer bitterness lingers on the palate a little bit lemony a touch of adjunct corn flavor  body is on the border of light and medium satisfying chuggable but not thin  ive been drinking a lot of this beer lately it is very good but overpriced the quality is better than most other mexican adjunct lagers quality is way above american adjunct lagers ice cold it is a smooth enjoyable flavorful lager to down in hot weather a lot better than most of the competition the balance is spot on tastes like beer not corn  rice juice better than corona or budweiser i like it more than heineken a very solid choice for lager
6401,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.28,clara looks clear and clean decent thick head smells decent for being very light no strong flavors and on the light side easy drinking enough you could make a session beer out of it until youre ready for a stronger brew its good enough id buy it i guess
6402,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.69,my favorite hot summer day beer crisp light sessionable not a world class beer but as far as mass produced goesnot many other beers come to mind for refreshing and accessible
6403,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,4.63,one of my favorite mexican beers very refreshing to drink at the beach in my opinion way better than corona and modelo
6404,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,1.76,clear light gold appearance with a fairly large white head and modest lacing cooked corn aroma that goes downhill as it warms not many ways to describe the bland taste other than that i did not have to spit it out light bodied lively carbonated mouthfeel going to try again doubtful
6405,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.52,12oz brown bottle neck of bottle is stamped bb aug 2023 clear pale gold colored body one finger of white head leaves behind scattered strings of lacing aroma of grain malts and a touch of floral hops taste is sweet malt with a toasted white bread note has a spice note along with floral hops sweet malt in the aftertaste thinner mouth feel good carbonation crisp and clean lager experience made to allow for several beers to be imbibed in a session smells and tastes like a malt beverage but does not go to any extremes
6406,Kirin Light Beer,2.93,i definitely dont think its fair or correct that this is rated as the 55th worst beer in the world here on ba i totally disagree and while its not among the best in this light international lager space its certainly not among the worst beers on the planet i like the new art on it more modern than what is pictured here and i always enjoy these asian ones in the large format never seen this one before now i dont think anyway the pour is impossibly light lesser than straw colored pretty clear and actually with a pretty and puffy pure white inch of head on it it looks right on actually with lots of carbonation rising up and a nice light golden shine the nose is minimal but its less chemical and cheap and obviously adjuncty than so many others maybe faintly metallic but not unappealing at all very little hops here but not totally invisible in the aroma lager yeast evident too although also very minimal the flavor starts off rather refreshing generically grainy to me but nothing weird its thin in feel but the carbonation is so high it never feels watery its only at the end where it gets a little yucky a strange bitterness rises up hints of rubber and wet paper and it lingers through the very dry finish unpleasantly on the tongue not sure what this is its an unfamiliar flaw almost lightly smoky somehow a faint molten plastic element too but really kind of distinct to this a shame because it was cooking along just fine before this still it doesnt ruin this drink and this ended up being a fine sushi companion way better than its ratings here especially compared against only similar items not sure why this has fallen so far down the list id drink it again
6407,Kirin Light Beer,1.98,poured from a brown bottle into a clear glass pour was a little yellowish in color with very little head smell is  the taste is weak and almost like beer overall this was lacking in flavor and everything else
6408,Kirin Light Beer,4.04,12 oz bottle bottled on 10feb21 purchased cold single from shangys two days ago poured into a 14 oz mug  l brilliantlyclear pale brasscolored liquid fizzy fleeting white foam on the pour gone in two minutes leaving a thin collar no lacing  s grain husk hint of sulfur light lemony accent relatively high intensity could smell it as it poured  t surprisingly bold flavors crackery and doughy malt of course cut rather dry but with that husky flavor swelling up in the aftertaste after a few beats some bready and lemon pithy notes emerge and linger  f smooth lightbodied flow not much contour or drag mildly fizzy light peppery warmth dry but not cut clipped or parching if it was slightly more cut quick and honed itd be darn near perfect  o despite the age of the bottle this example was in relatively good condition and im pleased that it was more than passable and enjoyable for its kind i could totally see getting this as a cheap palatecleaning accompaniment to wings 1965
6409,Kirin Light Beer,4.74,beer lovers will not be taking home any gold medals for how many people have watched the tokyo beer games so far  in several major markets around the world the beer audience has fallen since 2016 as beer drinking becomes more fragmented and drinkers drink in japan when audiences are mostly asleep in the united states and europe  while data from the opening beer ceremony and first few nights of beer events indicate that the kirin light is the least drank beer in recent history across europe and in the united states however drinking kirin light is up in australia and japan  comparisons with previous beer reviews are imperfect given the different times zones the covid pandemic and fewer beer options in the past but an upward trend is clear
6410,Kirin Light Beer,4.07,the caramel color looks pleasant but lacks carbonation making the pour a little underwhelming though it is light and isnt hoppy it has more flavor than many other light beers i would definitely drink it again
6411,Kirin Light Beer,2.75,the pour is hay colored the taste is watery malty gulpable rice  some sweetness to round it out i agree that this a bland beer but hey its only 95 calories this is an easier drinking kirin ichiban lager beer sorry but 32 abv is really low btw cheers c
6412,XXXX Bitter,2.05,750ml brown glass bottle with pulltab can from bottle mart port douglas australia  cheap malt is the main flavour here 6row pale malt would be my guess sort of generic with vague caramelmalted milk ball notes and little else rather underwhelmingnotches below carlton mid and similar competitors in terms of the australian market  low d  not recommended
6413,XXXX Bitter,2.99,a solid macro lager l light gold with frothy white head that fades quickly to lacing not much retention s slight grain but not much t similar light grain with a dry finish a touch of astringency from the high carbonation can have a metallic tang so i have always avoided drinking from cans f light a touch fizzy and the carbonation can have an astringent effect o i grew up on this stuff it so dominated the queensland beer market in the 1970s and 80s so i have a soft spot for this beer and served cold it is an acceptable thirst quencher in the queensland heat
6414,XXXX Bitter,1.09,horrible horrible beer  skip and go to xxxx gold or their summer bright lager if you must drink xxxx
6415,XXXX Bitter,5,the epitome of brewing this fine qld lager is the best to come out of australia fond memories of the grain and hop scents rolling through the grassy hills of milton and auchenflower im salivating while i reminisce
6416,XXXX Bitter,2.77,this beer is light and clean and ok for the type
6417,XXXX Bitter,1.5,
6418,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.6,2021 batch 3 drank in june 2022 didnt get as much from this as previous adwtd felt sweet without complexity that you would expect still very delicious just not worth the price
6419,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,5,complex and boozy hits all the right barley wine notes but adds so much more fruity sweet but not cloying thick but not too heavy just all around outstanding
6420,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.35,my first sacrifice at dark lord day 2023 its back baby this screenprinted batch 1 triple oak labelsporting those the aussie stickers with pridepoured a mildly viscous clear reddishcopper with nary a head to speak of though ringed by a bubbly tan chain  intensely woody up front it even leans a little pungent and catty right out of the bottle however it quickly transforms into an explodingly delectable maple tempered by a whiskey heat that both continue to expand on the exhale and with each subsequent sip  though this definitely shows its age its quite the experience nevertheless still im not sure anything can beat my nostalgia for the original cognaconly bomber despite my double oak rating being the highest of all three
6421,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.75,as good as it gets from the bottle at rosada ranch on 040223
6422,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.84,this is a special one i wanted to crack this while reading brandon sandersons tress of the emerald sea so i did  apppearance is dark brown just a shade brighter than a cup of coffee definitely some translucence  nose is just a cacophony of oak bourbon dark bread with plum jam apple butter caramel soaked raisins and coconut wow simply exquisite the nose is expressive but not overbearing restrained  the taste follows the nose perfectly sweet dark fruit like plum date and fig combined with caramel and brown sugar rich breadiness oak apple cherry baking spices everything works perfectly with each other  mouthfeel is full bodied not thick or syrupy either not too cloying a little bit of evaporation to counteract some tannins to dry it fits well in this regard it doesnt hang too heavy on the palate  overall this is stellar brew i cant think of many words to really capture how absolutely amazing this experience is a product crafted by masters in thier field and it shines through brilliantly
6423,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.6,2022 vintage  review 1600 ive saved a truly legendary beer for this milestone review the highest rated american barleywine on ba and 13th highest rated overall i just had the double oak version yesterday and it was damn good so i have high hopes for this lets crack this beast open and see what its all about  pours a cloudy dark brown with just a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a nothing and leaves no lacing but with fantastic legs  in the nose its also quite similar to double oak though with some more barrel presence im picking up on aromas of earthy bourbon charred oak molasses burnt caramel plum black cherry cognac toasted coconut sweet vanilla old leather light fig and toffee  the booze is more forward here but it pushes such wonderful complexities in taste that it actually adds to the experience on the front end of the sip im tasting cocoa powder black cherry cognac toasted oak sweet bourbon honey molasses dark toast fig sweet vanilla raisin light toffee and tobacco the swallow brings notes of leather smoky tobacco charred oak molasses fig black cherry toasted coconut port wine plum cacao nib burnt caramel brown sugar and light walnut  a full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a rich and silky beer finishes a tad sticky but the boozy tingle dries it out over time  this is incredible the double oak version was great too but this one edges it out definitely a beer ill remember for years to come
6424,Kronenbourg,2.75,march 2002 average french lager  easily drinkable but kronenbourg 1664 is better probably still my opinion today but its been years since the last time i bothered to buy it
6425,Kronenbourg,2.69,not a gourmet beer but cheap and made too have good times with your friends in front of a nice rugby game
6426,Kronenbourg,2.55,one of the local options in the strasboug alsatian scene and one of the big five french beers of the 1970s kronenbourg was probably the best of the big five and definitely the most popular and prevalent in paris at the time though the alsatianstrasbourg scene was the best of france it never compared with all that was going on across the great rhine river
6427,Kronenbourg,2.78,trying not to bring back any euros i picked up a couple more beers to finish off my french trip this one was cold  it is a yellow lager with nice lacing the aroma is faint but not funky the taste is thin and slightly sweet the aftertaste is nonexistent  not recommended its not worth your while
6428,Kronenbourg,2.51,500ml keg at au rendezvous des artistes montmarte paris 5 quite a light looking beer but one that sits nicely in the glass with a decent looking  quite fluffy textured head that also had good retention the nose was definitely basic with some slightly skunky notes  a little corn showing in the early going followed by the odd vegetable adjunct the taste of the beer was similar to the nose with some corn  a light sweetness alongside some faint bitterness  the odd malt it was very much a macro pale lager with moderate carbonation  a crisp slightly dry finish but it wasnt one id hurry back to
6429,Kronenbourg,4.05,kronenbourg original has a thick mousselike white head a bubbly golden clear appearance with lots of white sediment throughout and heavy glass lacing aroma is of banana white bread crust and white bread toast taste is similar with sharp hop bitterness mouthfeel is light to medium and kronenbourg finishes medium dry  rjt
6430,Kronenbourg,2.79,very average lager intrigued because its from france but besides being refreshing on a hot summer day there isnt much that i can say about this beer i wouldnt seek it out again very light 42 abv very little smell that i can discern nice head and lacing which generally maintained throughout drink this if you are sweating on a hot day and you need to get rehydrated  otherwise not worth itreminds me of bud light

6445,Wookey Jack,4.38,12oz can about 3 months old  pours over two fingers of fluffy brown head into my snifter retention is amazing after a solid few minutes there is still a sturdy finger of head lacing is perfect body is pitch black even when held to the light looks magnificent  nose is very spicey paired with a full dose of fresh baked bread almost a candy sweetness but it doesnt come across gross at all smells fantastic  you get that rye in full force on the flavor they really didnt hold back here and i love it  rye is often hard for me to pick up you also get some of that breadiness the roast doesnt come out until it gets a good while to warm the black characteristics arent huge but there is a deep maltiness that borders on molasses  its not gross or out of place at all this might be a touch old maybe thats why some sweetness is coming out but its aged quite well and has a nice smoothness once the eccentric spice passes  both being welcome  carbonation is mediumlow has a somewhat heavy body that is just the slightest bit cloying  some sugars are present but mostly subdued by the substantial spice and moderate bitterness a lovely mouthfeel  the drinkability is phenomenal especially for a beer at this abv with this much going on neither the sugar nor the spice slow me down one bit  a lovely little beer that starts with a hoppy rye kick and transitions to a smoother darker offering

6448,Wookey Jack,4.25,12oz can wine glass canned 122222  wookey resembles an imperial stout no highlights and a magnificent cappuccino head  christmas tree peppermint patty lavender there are layers of chocolate behind all the pine and herbal hops  malted milk balls and almost a milk stout richness though much more bitter and hopped than youd find with that style the pine returns in the backend accompanied by more floral flavors like lavender and lilac and earthy rye  creamy medium body medium carbonation its silky but balanced  definitely a good black ipa with strong and interesting hopping
6449,Wookey Jack,4.22,about pitch black with a robust sticky deep tan head nose is a pleasant blend of hood and malt caramel taste is like a toasted charry beer that happens to have hops in there like a dark pine forest it all works somehow i never seek dark ipas but made an exception when i saw this and having heard of how good it is toasted rye and tingly hops slight hints of sweetness maybe some coffee but this is mostly an earthy beer feels medium full and silky smooth yet with good carbonation this surprised me a bit not my style but this is just a very wellmade beer dont expect complexity or many different discernible flavors this is mostly about crafting balance to a simple yet flavorful conclusion going forward if i ever try another black ipa wj is the beer to which itll be measured

6454,Wookey Jack,4.49,dark as a stout with a large tan head and very good lacing complex aroma not just the smokey roasted malts but also licorice dried fruit pine and herbal hops taste keeps pushing the envelope as well the resinous base pairs with the solid array of malts especially the rye the focus shifts with each sip and cannot be easily pigeonholed full bodied but not heavy bitter but not palate numbing a good alcohol bite but not head spinning overall its not just about balance but how everything comes together
6455,Wookey Jack,4.29,got a few cans sent to me by jonphisher beer nerd extraordinaire poured very dark brown black with dark brown edges and had a very ambitious beige head which left sheets of lacing the aroma to my damaged nose was coffeeish with a vegetableplant like accent wet hay maybe i figured i was smelling it wrong as i generally dont smell much at all the taste was at first brash and harsh all the bite of the roasted rye and copious hops were dominant as it warmed the malts came out to play with rye bread and roasted grains with almost a sweetness at times the coffee and hops definitely shine the brightest but are well supported by the other ingredients the feel was lively due to the carbonation added to the bite i enjoy so much in rye beers especially didnt distract from the sweeter aspects though well done oa very glad to have been able to try this outstanding beer
6456,Wookey Jack,4.4,was so happy to hear that this beer was available again found that the thistle draftshop had it on draft and the family went with me on mlk day  poured from tap into a tulip glass beautiful black color with excellent head and curtain lacing smell and taste of citrus pine and roasted malt lime and dark pumpernickel toast wonderful bitter finish and rich full feel hoped they had cans but still on the lookout
6457,Thumbprint Enigma,4.18,12oz bottle no dating information found but the label name is enigma 23 brown colored body light tan head sticks around as an island and expanded ring leaves behind small lacing webs aroma of cherries oak and woody yeast taste is a sweet tart combination flavors of cherry oak vanilla caramel chocolate and a little smoke woody yeast arrives late and lingers into the aftertaste smooth and silky mouth feel dry finish good carbonation a layered beer with cherry upfront and yeast at the end and all supported by the oak barrel vinous to a degree
6458,Thumbprint Enigma,4.03,poured from a 12oz bottle into a tall new glarus pilsner glass pours like coca cola out of the bottle but gathers in the glass a murky dark brown with three fingers of sandy brown foam the nose and taste is a somewhat muddled mix of oak delicate and yeasty funk faint black cherry and event hints of red grapes however i get a slightly flandersesque vinegar aroma and flavor that i just dont care for as its very distracting mediumfull mouthfeel pretty slick and smooth as it warms though i just get more of the vinegar a little bit of an unusual flop from this place
6459,Thumbprint Enigma,4.23,pours dark amber with a nice dark head aroma is dark cherries and wild yeast strange as that may sound taste is sour but pleasantly so with again dark cherries and a moderate to light body nicely different
6460,Thumbprint Enigma,4.41,12 oz bottle no datecode enigma 23 purchased single last week from their beer depot poured into my chouffe tulip  dark reddishbrown liquid limitedtonoclarity tall rougetan foam stand tight and creamy a few lacy bands very floralforward aromas with cherryvanilla ice cream at the base and a nutty yeast accent bits of chocolate chunk and wood speckled in woody almost nutty brown ale flavor sits in a thin layer between a cherryflecked flowery top note and the tart cherrysoaked but relatively dry clearly oakhewned maltrich base browned ale colored with soft touches of milk chocolate and cocoa snaps i must reiterate this is not a sweet beer though its got all the desserty flavors just begging for decadent dulce not so much bitter as it is more tart stamping a stingy stripe across the middle of the tongue brief bit of bouncy roundness to its body before it drops mad dry at the palate floor airy aft but leaving a woodytannic warmth pasting the palate roof this tastes and drinks beautifully though looks a little suspect and has that superb cherry accent to it that doesnt feel quite right but ultimately arguably for sure mostly tastes like a flemish brown this is a work of art wish i knew and bought more 2198
6461,Thumbprint Enigma,3.99,appearance dark brown with a thin head  smell some wood first then funky acidic maybe a hint of cherry  taste tart beer with some brown sugar and sour cherry in the background and finish  overall picked up a single at the brewery im not usually a tartsour beer guy but im willing to try and tick a style its an interesting beer but not one ill revisit
6462,Thumbprint Enigma,4,thanks to fbarber for this one from a ninja box during nbs bif 12 12oz bottle no date poured into 6oz ng flute also courtesy fbarber poured a dark brown color with some reddish hints at the translucent edges there was 14 inch of tan head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing  the aroma had nice malts good wood scents some cherry and a touch of yeast spicefunk  pretty similar on the tongue with the funk taking the lead the fruit was noticeable but not dominant and the wood added a nice counterpoint  the body was on the thinner side smooth and had a dry finish  drinkability was very nice but its a sipper not a quaffer  overall another great brew from ng a musttry if you see it
6463,Massacre,4.21,pours an almost black brown small foamy head that recedes to a thin ring after about a minute or so  a little bourbon on the nose followed by stewed stone fruits raisins a little toffee peaks in as well  the bourbon sits in behind the woody barrel character which is sting on the tongue some of the the stewed fruit and a little chocolate follow lightly drying  the body is moderate there is a lightness to this despite the high abv and barrel very good  this is a very enjoyable beer
6464,Massacre,4.14,hot as fuck
6465,Massacre,4.49,another michigan brewery nails it doppelbock very heavy boozy im lucky to be in mi where i can score this often outstanding
6466,Massacre,4.29,the pour is much darker than i expected not black but darn close a beige head says hello and then quickly takes its leave the aroma bourbon on forefront no bones about that boozy figs prunes raisins and caramel a potent aroma that is making me wonder what ive got myself into  the taste is not what i expected either theres an initial sweetness that seems to accompany many ba beers but that is quickly replaced by a bitterness whether that is from hops or roasted malts i cannot say not unpleasant and keeps this from being cloying bourbon figs caramel char coffee dates all shout to be heard tasted sorry and its a fun flavor fight for a while i will state that i am glad it was just a 12 oz serving it almost wore me out trying to separate out what i was tasting the feel is good no issues at all viscous enough to remind you this is punching above its normal weight class glad this is available locally i think ill try and cllar one or two and see how they hold up

6469,Massacre,4.25,good head production and ok retention body is a very dark brown nearly but not quite black and does not appear to be perfectly clear lacing is shortlived on the glass  huge bourbon on the nose booze mash oak prune raisin toffee caramel a wonderful aroma that is simultaneously inviting and a touch intimidating  very challenging on the palate theres an initial sweetness matching the nose but that is quickly replaced by a surprising bitterness a combination of the oak roasted barley and hops bourbon slightly soured grapes caramel toffee light char coffee dates everything hits so quickly and all together that its difficult to pick it apart and similarly not quite as easy to approach as other beers  very smooth on the palate with little harshness despite the skyhigh abv  this is an excellent beer that promises to age well fresh its more bitter than i think it deserves i would challenge anyone with access to this beer to try it at various ages fresh 1 and 2 years
6470,Massacre,4.35,appearance  the beer was black in color with a mocha colored head crowning the glass  smell  the dark vaults of the logger made for caramel like notes with the bourbon  taste  smooth bourbon combine with chocolate nuts its still had a little bite there were chocolate notes as well a little bitterness lingered toward the back  mouthfeel  the field was amazingly smooth with small carbonation  overall  for the style this was superb it was smooth and chocolatey
6471,Massacre,4.43,courtesy of blutz as a trade extra 2017 wolverine state massacre bba imperial dark lager never heard of the brewery or the brew so totally new to me 12 oz bottle nicely waxsealed poured cellar temp assertively to an ipaish widemouth glass halfinch head comes out as an oddity much like the dark soul i had some time ago in that it has a creamy mocha tan color that looks like it belongs on an oatmeal stout instead of a lager color is dark translucent burnt mahogany nose has a very prominent bourbon aroma sweet caramel and some winter spiciness  first sips are surprising and marvelous the bourbon is strong the main profile is oozy dark caramel with an ending hit of a cinnamonesque flavor it reminds me of a nice barleywine in some respects mouthfeel is full decadent with carbonation on the finish that clears the way for a longlasting linger of all the flavors boozy aroma and flavor that matches the abv but no burn and no warmingmuch too easy to drink like its an 8er but this is clocking in over 14 as it warms more stone fruit flavors like plumprune come to the mid and rear of the swallow  its totally delicious three years has done it justice
6472,Massacre,4.17,12oz bottle at sharemuddy brown pour with a small beige head seemingly like a stout roast malts and chocolate filter up first followed by some brown sugar and bourbon taste is more roast boozy and a bit more stoutish than a dopplebock but still great
6473,Massacre,4.21,poured into a pint glass a nice dark chestnut color fairly clear and with a modest tan head vanilla and bourbon dominated the first sniff and a closer inspection brought roasted grain notes like caramel and cherry the taste followed the barrel was there but supported the caramel and cherry notes full bodied but this did not feel like a 14 abv beer slightly boozy and hot on the finish but this was well done i was impressed with the rich malty notes as this stayed true to a doppelbock despite the heft well done and recommended for a big beer
6474,Massacre,4.16,very nice rich hearty bock from a solid local brewery no date printed on bottle pours a thicker honeyed rust brown color with just a little offwhite head and very minimal scant lingering lacing smells of brown sugar raisin fig malt caramel vanilla and faint hops tastes similarly strong sipper for sure but still the very high abv was a little deceivingly hidden good depth and complexity smooth slightly sticky mouthfeel with decent carbonation a solid beer for its style
6475,Massacre,4.52,jan 2021 review 2020 vintage poured into a chalice  similar to previous reviews except this is fresher a bit more alcohol bite less head and lacing than last years review but still really tasty any worth trying overall going to knock look taste feel down a notch each  review dec 15 2019 2017 vintage poured into a tulip glass  overall essentially the same as the jul 2018 review this is really good reminds me more of a barleywine than a lager but great no matter the name this was my last 2017 but i think ive got some 2018 and need to find some 2019 absolutely worth tryingbuying if you see it   updated review jul 26 2018 pour 2017 vintage so about 9 months old 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass beautiful mahagony color with light coming through on the edges 12 finger tan head that dissaptes into clouds and a nice ring with small amounts of lacing really attractive  nose lots going on here caramel molasses dark chocolate raisins and brandied dark fruits dominate as label notes sweet bourbon and malt also present  taste definitely follows the nose but maybe even more molasses and bourbon on the front end definite chocolate dark fruit as well some hoppy bitterness on the backend keeps the sweetness well balanced 145 abv is well hidden alcohol is there but really well balanced not sure why i didnt like this as much the first time but suspect aging has helped mellow the alcohol bite into a soft embrace lol i really like this  mouthfeel fair amount of carbonation but still a thick viscous syrupy feel thats right up my alley bitterness on the backend lingers a bit but quickly clears maybe the lagering gives it a clean finish really have no idea why i ranked this relatively low the first time maybe the carbonation has mellowed  overall i really like this a bba lager is unusual but this is absolutely worth trying again aging seems to have improved it in my opinion but maybe i just didnt appreciate it the first time or just in a great beer mood tonight after thinking i would not buy again i will seek out he 2018 vintage when available one 2017 left that i will save for a meaningful wolverine victory hopefully this fall  original review ratings from around oct or nov 2017 look 4 smell 425 taste 35 feel 3 overall 375 i recall not really liking it a lot too in your face

6480,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,3.42,12oz bottle poured into a teku glass look is a somewhat hazy golden yellow with two fingers of white head the head has fairly good retention smell is a little below medium in strength the smell of vanilla is slightly strongest and bfollowed by banana clove funk yeast and a musty smell it has somewhat of a banana bread smell the balance in the smell is outstanding but the musty smell lowers it to very good taste is mediumlow in strength the taste follows the nose with the addition of a peppery taste the flavor is very good im very disappointed how light the flavor is so the light flavor makes it good at best feel is medium in thickness theres barely any creaminess which is extremely unfortunate for this style carbonation is medium its somewhat dry the lack of creaminess is unforgivable overall this beer went down hill and then died with the feel hefeweizens are my favorite beer style after this sixpack i wont buy this beer again

6488,Old Style Light,2.54,poured from a cab into a plastic cup pours golden straw yellow with a fluffy white head smells of corn and cereal grain underwhelming tastes of watery grain no hops of any sort beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation overall a below average beer
6489,Old Style Light,3.26,l just to as close to water as possible lots of carbonation onefinger bubbly white head s sweet grain smell t suprisingly good i will drink old style especially at wrigley it does have some good grain and malt taste especially for a light way better than bud coors and others f crisp light and refreshing like it is supposed to be o as good as macro gets i will drink this pabst and moosehead
6490,Old Style Light,4,old style light  pabst brewing company poured from the can into a pint glass this brews head is two fingers thick with spotty lacing and a rather pale light golden clear body  smells like corn with a touch of other fullbodied grains  lighter on the cormmalt than others but still enjoyable nonetheless at least it actually has a flavor to it  the mouthfeel is mediumlight with mild carbonation  ill give old style light an overall rating with a solid 4 i could chill on these on a nice hot day
6491,Old Style Light,4.18,old style light brewed by pabst brewing company with an abv of 380 this brew pours out a golden amber color with a small white head there is a nice amount of carbonation to this light brew there is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew it sticks to the side of the glass nice the smell of old style light is rich with grains and malts lots of corn and other malts in the smell you pick up a hint of hops in the smell of this brew this light brew has the look and smell of most light brews on the market not saying that is a bad thing now for the taste light and crisp with grains and malts for the style this brew is pretty decent not the best but it is smooth i like how smooth this brew goes down there is nothing overpowering about this light brew old style light has an decent balance to it the mouth feel of old style light is light crisp clean smoothand refreshing overall im giving old style light a 425 out of 5 not a bad drinking brew it would go down good on a hot summer day i would buy this brew again pabst brewing company did a nice job with this light brew
6492,Old Style Light,2.28,1 cans during cubs games at the mill in iowa city priced appropriately
6493,Old Style Light,2.28,painfully average but heavier a light beer than i expected i thoroughly enjoy old style despite a lot of the divided and often negative opinions it merits my father cites it and miller high life as the two worst beers he has ever had and this light alternative is almost the same in terms of matching how filling its brother beer is other than that it brings a middling taste to the table but after miller 64 everything seems so exquisite in flavor
6494,Old Style Light,3,left the night shift early to hit the casino with a coworker he had a case of old style light in his backseat we shotgunned a few of them in the parking lot each i then walked in like i owned the place put 100 down on red and lost after we each lost a little more money we laughed about the whole thing over some more old style lights and an illegal cigarette  overall old style light isnt weihenstephaner original but its now the traditional casino beer
6495,Oude Fermier,4.68,2020 vintage mostly clear yellow pour with a fat finger of eggshell white foam spotted lacing i went in skeptical here but actually i must admit this is top shelf smell capture a myriad of oak nuances catching fruit peach orange lime white grape and green apple as the most defined add a hint of dandelion and must to round out taste takes it a step further honestly sps best nonfruit wild saison if not their best saison period add passion fruit pear and a whisper of grapefruit to the fruit from the nose oak is now toasty and bright vinous kiss adds layers in a gentle way floral tones are more generic compared to nose though must and funk elevate feel is bright sour sneaky funky oak backing is refined and dries out well through the sip with controlled acidity dotting the palate very dialed in
6496,Oude Fermier,4.42,an enjoyable saison 2020 vintage enjoyed in a tulip at a creve coeur mo courtyard dry oak white wine appropriate level of funk but refreshing with citrus notes and the right level of sour ive heard that this vintage wasnt as good so definitely didnt live up to the hype but i still found it fairly enjoyable
6497,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.36,l standard golden yellow lager little lacing s extremely sweet like sour apple candy not like beer t still pretty bad burnt vanilla corn and green apples standard for minhas brewing similar to the boxer beers the harsh taste masks the high alcohol content f not as bad as the taste but weird texture luckily goes away quick carbonation is reasonable overall only buy this for the awesome can design and to prank your friends by asking them to drink it
6498,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.27,this stuff is barely drinkable as with all high gravity malt liquors this one is sweet and it has very little head and it leaves no lacing this one is no good try at your own risk
6499,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,2.77,jaguar hi gravity lager nice powerful name got this from my son he likes cool looking cans i think he had one and said here dad you can review theseha ho lets go hope this is a step up from my previous malt liquor reviews poured into a pint glass nice golden yellow with a lot of head but left quick they aroma ah what can i say i really dont know what the hell it isperfumy metallic damp straw thats starting to mold not overpowering but different taste very carbonated feel that leaves a really smooth texture on the tongue a grassy wheatie slightly watery brew as the brew continues to warm the smoothness hangs in there even as the metal becomes more present an interesting note a white wine like flavour is coming on kinda like a carlo rossi jug wine chablis this is beginning to go down too easy trouble is on the way not something id seek out but too late it found me good snough i mean enough 
6500,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.7,part of a trifecta from the liquor store we had gotten this in by mistake along with other melanie products the manager offered me a can of this along with evil eye we were liquidating stock i took it home and poured it into my jack daniels pint glass it was a pale straw color winey along with green apples legs were left on the glass after finishing this i curled up into the fetal position and wanted to die
6501,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.66,jaguar high gravity lager has a medium white fizzy quicklydissipating head no lacing and a clear very bubbly yellowgolden appearance the aroma is of subtle and sickening green apple grain husks barley sicklysweetness and a shadow of hops the mouthfeel is light to medium and jaguar finishes somewhat crisp and refreshing but also somewhat harsh this is pretty hard to stomach and i think its not even worth trying avoid  rjt
6502,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.5,this beer will immediately make you question life why am i doing this to myself  pale anemic gold color flecks of lace that ring the glass looks yellow almost green not much in the way of retention dead glassy surface after a few minutes  smells like white grapes sweet cereal froot loops vitamins and a general lack of self respect  tastes like the same crap adjuncts added sugars sticky mealy astringent feel deadening alcohol on the palate sweet grainy taste some fusels pretty rough though not the utter worst ive experienced this is nothing more than a cheap buzz in a shitty package avoid if you possess any shred of dignity  yes i bought this for the stupid can graphics
6503,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.49,big thanks to chris spycow for finding this in an outoftheway wisconsin gas station apparently this was less than a dollar served in a beeradvocate taster glass  a  quickdissolving white foam settles to a neartransparent cap leaving spotty lace behind slightly lighter than earthquake but similarly bubbly  s  compared to earthquake this is downright terrible alcohol rotting fruit and garbage and god knows what else  t  taste is a tiny bit better as it dials down the rotten flavors and replaces them with sickeningly cloying sweetness not as boozy as some of the other malt liquors although this is a light one at 83  m  surprisingly chewy texture with a dry finish but toothcoating stickiness not as much heat as earthquake unsurprisingly carbonation is moderate to low somewhat indescribable and not in a good way  d  this may be the worst true malt liquor weve had so far although theres always a chance one of the other gems will usurp the throne a musttry for lovers of bad beer
6504,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.21,brewed and bottled by mountain crest in monroe wisconsin this means brewed by the minhas craft brewery maybe it used to be brewed by city for melanie  this 83 malt liquor pours a glowing yet dark golden yellow in color there is a quarter to half inch of foamy white head the aroma is strangely fruity for a lager there is cherry green apple tropical fruity and a strange chemicallyalcohol aroma i hope this tastes better than it smells whoa it does not taste better in fact it tastes worse this is like a chemical fruity alcohol cleaning product this is atrocious and all but undrinkable if your goal is to get drunk cheap there are bettertasting alternatives
6505,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.03,poured a sort of bright yellow color with a good amount of quickly dissipating white head it smell is solid alcohol and not good at that smells terrible no redeeming beer smell qualities at all taste is godawful i wish i was exaggerating but this is complete shit its only 83 but tastes like pure alcohol got some bubbles towards the end light mouthfeel but the tastes ruins any chance of this beer going down smoothly its surprising but this beer is even worse than i remembered it being i will not be drinking this ever again
6506,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.18,clear pale straw color with a puffy white collar that leaves a little bit of lacing  aroma was malty sweet with a little sugar mixed in maybe some graininess  taste was horrible cloying sweetness that just astounds me why not quite as wretched as in a minahs brew but its still wretched  feel was slick and oily and nothing pleasing  i tried to guzzle as much as i could but could only handle a handful of sipsdrinking any more is a waste good thing the drain is always thirsty
6507,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.81,in honor of the recent lunacy in our neighbor state i decided to go with a selfproclaimed union made beer out of monroe wi gotta love cans labeled with animals sconnies  a golden blonde with a weak white head good clarity and looks like a light summer beer  s corn musty unidentified adjunct and a bit of banana pretty mild but what is there is not desirable  t sweet and fruity not sure where this is coming from but i get lime and cloying banana strange and not in a particularly good way  m smooth with fine carbonation and a bit of alcohol bite  flavor is bizarre like some zima somehow found its way into the tank this started out as a peculiarity but by the time i finished the 22oz it was a nauseating chore not quite bad enough to make the list of worst malt liquors but this is classic skip enjoyment and go straight to intoxication
6508,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.49,served in a snifter  and swillfest 15 rolls on and in geodesic snifters no less what better vessel for such a libation eh when i saw this can a few months ago my mind pulled for me to purchase it but i demurred then upon seeing this on a more recent beer run to kenosha i felt it had to come into my possession  which leads to today it pours a clear apple juice topped by a finger or so of quickdying white foam the nose is indeed how senor chandler below described it with cotton candy stalks dancing with remnants of vinyl and motor oil i dont get the rest of the factory but then again i aint woody be i the simple strangeness of it is actually pretty impressive though in the wrong way the taste takes a slightly different tack more closely resembling some yammy wd40 yeah seriously this is some godawful shit lemme tell ya the body feels heavier than it probably is bad tastes weigh more than good ones maybe with a light moderate carbonation a watery feel and a dry finish overall nothing about this horrid thing makes me want to ever drink it again it was all i could do to muster up the strength to down the rest of my glass hoping against hope that only the minimum would actually touch my tongue and harangue my buds only one word for this yicchleggh  on a strange note feeling oddly empowered if thats the right word i decided to add some tabasco to what remained in my glass after emptying the can i dripped in some of mikes old sauce best by label read 032010 and gulped some down much to the painful glee of those witnessing the act to my surprise the taste was akin to crazy eds now wheres the shooting star running over my head
6509,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.68,served in a snifter  thanks to tmoney2591 for giving me thisi think  there is too much malt liquor for my liking this liquor pours a golden color with not much head at all the smell is equivalent to sniffing pepto bismalim not sure why this beer is odd but hell its jaguar the taste felt like a jaguar mauled my taste buds there is an acrid horrible feeling that i wish i had never ever ever tasted the mouthfeel is smooth but horrible i dont know how else to describe it the drinkability is dont
6510,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,2.31,thanks to woodychandler for the tradepoured from a 16 oz can has a golden color with a 12 inch head smell is mild alcohol the only thing really coming through taste is  uh well lets say you can taste the 83 in there some notes of plastic not very good feels light in the mouth and is not very drinkable overall this is a beer best avoided
6511,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.25,i cant believe it here is a beer that is already a solid f albeit after just two reviews and here comes the canquest tm i am not holding out much hope  another union made can i am a unionist but this kind of thing makes me shake my head in wonder i tried really to generate some head but to no avail the white foam fell as quickly as i could pour color was a pretty goldenyellow with nequality clarity nose was the unpleasant combination of plastics factory and cotton candy how do they achieve this it is ungodly mouthfeel was thinto medium with an inherent sweetness that would throw a diabetic into a coma omfg this is nearly unfit for human cansumption finish left me gasping for air oof
6512,Keystone Premium,5,i have drank many different beers over the years iron city and lite rolling rock bud and bud light coors light yuengling and keystone premium is by far my favorite a very nice balance of taste not heavy and bitter but not too light and sweet either i pray that they never stop making it
6513,Keystone Premium,1.59,ice cold on a hot day and it was still disgusting my neighbor handed me one out of his cooler while i was doing yard work the taste is metallic and skunky there are notes of corn and grains for something positive smell is very similar to the taste only less intense on the metallic aspect mouth feel is pretty much the same as water probably the worst beer i have ever tasted
6514,Keystone Premium,1.93,very similar to coors banquet with the sweet maltscorn and hiccup causing finish only real difference is the alcohol is strangely more noticeable
6515,Keystone Premium,1.51,well here comes more of that urine and garbage liquid yellow blended with water doesnt for a head a mixture of metal corn futuristic aluminum space ship alloys and molecular aromas your primitive nose wouldnt understand  taste takes on a weird subtle physical matter in the liquid aspect water and sawdust from the corn husks used a malt i dont understand what made this premium at all more barley barf city notice i didnt talk about hops or yeast yeah not sure theyre here somehow this is worse than keith stone light
6516,Big Hazy,4,pours a hazy orange with a 12f head  smells of citrus  tastes of orange lemon apricot and pineapple with a barely bitter alcohol warm finish  medium body with light carbonation lightly lush syrupy mouthfeel  this is a super juicy sipper of an ipa i had this on draft and it was a bit watery and a bit unlike what i think of being a typical lfl brew i hope i can a can to compare
6517,Big Hazy,4.04,poured into a 13 oz tulip glass canned on 83023 pours a cloudy orange with a solid finger sticky white head that thin streaks of lace with solid retention 425  aroma really the orange steals the show grapefruit pineapple and apricot kind of a one trick pony but a good trick 4  taste follows orange pineapple apricot and a little grapefruit in the finish 4  mouthfeel is medium plenty of life not sticky or dry and at 92 the alcohol is well hidden 425  overall this is nice and i can see me spending 17 a 4 pack when i see it fresh nothing ground breaking but tasty 4
6518,Big Hazy,3.94,looka copper ale type with little to no haze really do not consider this hazy but white fizzy head and moderate carbonation smelldialed back orange smell with citrus abound more of a lemon to meand light hop orange marmalade  hint of the grassy field tastea tang of citrus off the front for sure biting juice with a bit of form leading it into bitter grapefruit some balance of semisweet with a bitter significance in the drying finish that is resolute the tang of the bite seems to make the abv nonexistent feela slick and drinkeasy properties make it with a little lacing and a vibrant carbonation that lightens the filling overallthis beer was a little too citrus dominant to me after the three four pack haha i was loving this beer on the first one but dialed it back to very good i tend to stay away from fruited beers but i get sucked in on a hot day definitely worth a try because lawsons finest is worth a try pretty much always salut cheers
6519,Big Hazy,4.15,true to lawsons this is a hazy dipa that is nowhere near a turbid murk bomb instead its slightly cloudy but you can nearly read through it regardless solid head production and retention  on the nose its difficult to tell where the hop expression ends and the orange begins  in a good way very complementary notes  more bitter than most in the hazy crowd but dialed back perhaps a touch from the sunshine series it also lacks some of the soft malt sweetness of the sunshine beers ruby red grapefruit double sunshine is a natural comparison point but this beer while very good in its own right isnt nearly as nuanced and delicious theres a nice slightly sour sharpness from the natural orange and lighter tropical and stone fruit notes adding to the citrusforward mix  supremely drinkable especially given the abv but it does drink much closer to a wc or traditional ipa than it does a hazy ipa  overall this is frankly a delicious beer and very refreshing despite the monster abv its nowhere near lawsons finest however pun not intended nor is it the best example of the style lawsons has only fairly recently started chasing the ne ipa trend ironic considering they along with hf and the alchemist were the protone ipas upon which the style emerged sadly they dont chase trends nearly as well as they set them  but falling well shy of lawsons lofty heights results in a beer thats still really damn good
6520,Big Hazy,4.05,16oz can dated under 2 weeks ago  big pungent tangerine in the nose and palate medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel finishes like a tangerine tonic abv well hidden
6521,Big Hazy,3.81,canned 11 days ago i think the most impressive part of this is how drinkable it is given the abv  its not weighed down by a syrupy malt character or teeth grating hoppiness just a straightforward orangebacked dipa that definitely gives some of that sip of sunshine dank citrus hop candy character while also being unique not the biggest fan of fruited ipas and this is no exception but my expectations were exceeded here  77100
6522,Big Hazy,4.31,16 ounce can packaged 081723  moderate pour yields a one inch white head over a hazy light golden body with lacing  nose of orange tropical fruit and other citrus with a bit of floral aromas as well  taste is mostly orange with flavors of tropical fruit and other citrus with orange peel sweet citrus pith bitterness is present through the finish  nice fairly full mouthfeel with medium carbonation  overall a great easy drinking dipa that hopefully will be put into lawsons year round lineup go get yourself a 4pack  cheers
6523,Speedway Stout,4.35,poured from a 16 ounce can the body is very dark and opaque small initial head and light lacing  aroma is mix of malty char dark chocolate and coffee delightful  taste follows nose with an increased flavor of the coffee add a nice boozy flavor not too hot id prefer a bit more char but this beer is delicious  at first a lighter mouthfeel than expectedhoped for but still solid once warmed the mouthfeel was nicely creamy carbonation light
6524,Speedway Stout,3.87,awesome
6525,Speedway Stout,4.52,canned on 31023 poured a dark chocolate color into a standard pint glass with a caramel 2 fingers high head that lingered and left an abundant amount of fine lacing behind earthy malt aroma is present with strong coffee and chicory presence up front anticipate from the smell that the flavor will be mainly coffee but it balances out with a nice malty backbone and a bittersweet chocolate finish full bodied not for the light hearted and 12 abv this is a sipper another one well done respect
6526,Speedway Stout,3.92,12oz bottled on nov 16 2021 no thanks to the barely visible etching in the glass above the label that i can only see now that the bottle is room temp poured into a spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 12 abv the beer pours dense black with light brown colored head the head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a web of lacing the aroma is mild with roasted malt and coffee the taste is bittersweet roasted malt with weak coffee moderate bitterness mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish overall ok but not the world class beer i expected not likely to purchase another alesmith product with the hidden date etching
6527,Speedway Stout,4.5,look black as night and even my gentle pour initiates a billowing brown head that holds as a pillow and refuses to settle eventually relenting and leaving sheets of lacing behind aroma espresso roasted barley bakers cocoa ethanol blackstrap molasses freshly baked bread dark cherries light earthiness and piloncillo taste starts out with a ton of rich dark chocolate that hinges on the edge of fullblown bitter cocoa and quickly joined by espresso light cherry and roast these go back and forth with a nice breadearthy profile in the middle with subtle caramel molasses and piloncillo hanging around peeking in occasionally and closes with cocoa coffee and ethanol mouthfeel full silky smooth medium carbonation and a smooth finish with a slight robust edge overall this is outstanding stuff ive only had this beer a few times in my craft beer experience and i forgot just how wellmade and tasty it is especially for such a big beer coffee dark chocolate roast earthiness malt sweetness and alcohol come together in harmony to make this tasty libation and glad to have the chance to try it again recommended
6528,Speedway Stout,4.22,poured from a 16 oz can dated 12062022 into a willi becher pint glass l  pours a dark brown almost black with a small tan head that dissipates slowly leaving a nice ring around the glass s  smells of coffee and chocolate t  tastes matches the smell lots of coffee and chocolate f  full bodied with carbonation on the lighter side o  very tasty stout
6529,Speedway Stout,4.09,smallish beige dense head slow to recede but eventually becomes a film of fine bubbles streaky lacing after each sip the color is nearly blackno light passes  strong mocha aroma with light alcohol and just a touch of chalk some fine background subsequent smells lean more toward the chocolate than the coffee  the taste reminds me of powdered unsweetened cocoa the body is full but not oily despite the high abv of 12 this is enhanced with a lower carbonation level the taste becomes more bitter with a coffee ground flavor coming through in the swallow long bitter bakers chocolate aftertaste
6530,Speedway Stout,4.49,purchased at bound beverage warrington pa 16504pk 16oz cans  pours a welcoming dark dark brownnearly black color a one finger dense beige colored head that fades to a ring around the glass  aromas of sweet chocolate and roasted malts  a delicious mix of sweet chocolate coffee caramellike toffee and deep roasted malts all the flavors meld together for a nearly perfect imperial stout the 12 abv is well hidden but youll need to respect it and take your time sipping this brew  a creamy heavier consistency low to moderate carbonation leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste  overall an excellent stout id love to try this aged in bourban barrels highly recommendedcheers
6531,Speedway Stout,4.66,poured from a pint can with into a tulip glass  appearance very dark brown  approaching black  with a 1 12dark tan head that lingered and left nice lacing  nose dark roast coffee a little chocolate  mouthfeel heavy perfect for a beer of this horsepower  attack omigoodness  dark roast following the nose coffee toffee chocolate  finish alcohol roast bitterness to balance the attack  this is the epitome of an imperial stout totally deserves its worldclass rating so well balanced flavorful drinkable though i enjoy it as a sipper theres no beer id rather pair with a rich chocolate dessert though today its doing just fine with mixed lightly salted nuts
6532,Speedway Stout,3.94,this is an abv bomb at 12 the look in a glass is quite lovely with a dark body and thin head the smell is of strong coffee together with an almost bourbon or rye smell most likely due to the high alcohol level the taste is strong and close to syrupy this is more of a desert beer and indeed i took my time sipping this one i prefer lower abv beers than this one but for the style it is a solid effort
6533,Speedway Stout,4.35,poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass  l pitch black  s coffee aroma but not overpowering  t tannic coffee flavor complemented by a nice roasted malt flavor with a hint of cocoa  f full bodied mouthfeel  o  an absolutely fantastic imperial stout
6534,Speedway Stout,4.25,higher gravity beervent calendar 2022 day 18
6535,Speedway Stout,4.26,received in a proxytrade hybrid from turkeysdrinkbeer in february 2022 drunk in november of that year  l a very thin caramelcoloured head sits atop an inky black glass of thicklooking deadstill beer no light penetrates the veil and no carbonation is visible  s the nose has roasted chocolate and coffee beans rich gooey toffee sits beneath  t the first thing to note is the absolute lack of booze on the palate theres none present on the way down and no sting on the tongue i suspect this beer hides its weapons in plain sight i dont see them yet and i dont feel them now but when they kick in im going to wonder what hit me  tastewise theres coffee but its quite subtle theres a layer of milky chocolate and as i always perceive in stouts these days a raspberry and cola note theres some residual sweetness after the swallow that stops me from crushing what would otherwise be a reasonably quickdrinking beer  the ability of this beer to hide its 12 gives it extra marks  m the beer is smooth and oily on the mouth but theres the slightest thinness that i think comes from the lack of booze in the flavour  o with mouthfeel being the only knock on this beer its an extremely enjoyable drink the sweetness never gets cloying and the booze never gets uncomfortable i wouldnt want more than one but thats ok in the case of this beer as id regret two of these the next day  cheers 147
6536,Speedway Stout,4.54,notes from 6192022 poured from a 16oz can into a snifter the beer is jet black with a small head that quickly dissipates to a thin cap the intensity of aroma is medium the aroma has dark chocolate strong cold brewed coffee and maybe a hint of cinnamon theres a slight sweetness in the aroma the intensity of taste is high the flavor has strong dark coffee and dark chocolate that are so well balanced that they quickly fluctuate the underlying maltiness is sweet the hops are spicy and are both in balance with the coffee and chocolate flavors the thickness is well thick its a little slick very creamy and the astringency is medium and in balance with the carbonation which is slightly above low overall the balance of flavors and the balance of elements in the mouth feel is masterful i like that the intensity of aroma is moderate and it made me unprepared for how very strong the flavor is its a world class imperial stout that i anticipate getting again
6537,Workhorse IPA,4.12,look rich clear deepdark reddishorange with a good head that settles in leaving good lacing aroma citrus fruits some dank some fir and pine notes blueberries freshly baked bread lingering in the background taste follows the nose but much more pronounced citrus fir needles orange and dank up front followed by hints of blueberry good maltiness holds it all together good bite and medium dryness on the finish mouthfeel medium carbonation silky and smooth overall  really good and honestly less carbonatedtasting than i expected especially given the freshness overall this is tasty stuff this used to be a goto for me for some time but then i got away from it so glad i was able to be reacquainted as this is really good a wellmade and great balanced wcipa that is readily available fresh in these parts im sure it didnt hurt just how stinking fresh this is too  im consuming it five days after it was canned canned 6420 drank 6920
6538,Workhorse IPA,4.18,had this on 20190530 in portland or at the brewery
6539,Workhorse IPA,4.51,a good consistant solid ipa even out of a can money well spent i was quite surprised as my previous encounters with workhorse were in a bottle which was good too
6540,Workhorse IPA,3.99,12 ounce can dated 121118 poured into tulip glass pours a deep orange just off white head some chill haze but poured out of the can crystal clear rings and spots of lacing well presented beer aromas of grapefruit resiny weed oniongarlic going on classic west coast grapefruit orange pith pine tree finish still some of that garlic and weedy notes at the end thick syrupy mouthfeel at first which leads to a lighter finish this beer packs a huge hop punch i usually dont care for the big resinyweed beers but the citrus hop profiles help to balance some of that out
6541,Workhorse IPA,4.89,fresh and crisp bright finish
6542,Workhorse IPA,3.53,a thanks to the captain of the canquest woodychandler for this beer poured from a 12 oz can has a goldenorange color with a 12 inch head smell is of citrus peaches some pine taste has lots of pine very bitter light peaches hints of alcohol feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer
6543,Workhorse IPA,4.25,ive had way better ipas but honestly this really is a workhorse  i committed to a 6 pack and greatly enjoyed all 6 and approachable and easy drinking ipa that may become my goto for the summer june 2018 portland or green zebra mart
6544,Workhorse IPA,4.16,once more the tavour service comes through for the canquest tm is a big way i may not be buying many bottled beers through them but you can bet your bottom dollar that i am snapping up cans as they become available  from the can huge hop flavor and aroma in a balanced northweststyle ipa  i cracked open the vent  canmenced a slow gentle glug into the awaiting glass i was overjoyed when it created twoplus fingers of dense foamy rocky tawny head all on its own without any bidding color was solid amber srm   7  9 with nequality clarity nose was utterly resinous with pine  now my hophead mouth was watering think of it  no haze no tropical fruit no bs mouthfeel was medium the taste was so full of pine that i thought that i was holding the knob end of george bretts bat mmmm this was exactly the sort of thing that i had been jonesing for it had a light woodiness and a little bit of a peach flavor to accompany the intense pine with a bit of biscuitiness mmmm i was really pleasantly surprised since i thought that this type of beer was either impossible or illegal to produce currently i jest of course but this was a welcome throwback to the sorts of beers that originally got my attention  made me realize that i am a selfdescribed selfavowed hophead finish was dry bitter and just the way that i like them ymmv
6545,Workhorse IPA,4.46,the problem with some wc style ipas is that the brewer puts the abv above the flavor not on this beer though this is a well balanced ipa throughly impressed the smell doesnt do justice to its mouthfeel  flavor on the nose i get basic ipa didnt expect this flavor very god wc ipa worth the trip if youre in portland
6546,Genny Light,3.88,genesee light is a good beer one of the best light beers ive ever had its made in ny which is a major plus the flavor is nice and has a hint of citrus carbonation is appropriately measured and its not expensive definitely worth a try
6547,Genny Light,4.12,im giving this beer a 5 in appearance there literally was a carbonation tornado that formed after i poured into a glass never in thousands of beers have i seen this smell is awful taste is very smooth and easy to slug down enjoyable for what it is
6548,Genny Light,2.88,24oz can stamped h158 110338 poured into a large mug at fridge temp no abv listed on can the beer pours bright light golden straw yellow with off white head the head recedes to a thin ring skim coating the aroma is a little yeasty and vegetable the taste is very nuetral up front with no real malt washing into a barely tart mildly bitter and buttery finish the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and an undry finish overall average too much unfinished business for this yeast the microwave popcorn butter is the strongest flavor here
6549,Genny Light,3.67,we utilized this at a middle of nowhere upstate new york casino found it at a redemption center in a one stoplight town the 12er was located on the bottom of the cooler fridge in a section that hadnt been opened since the 90s went down easy and did the job
6550,Genny Light,4.08,a nice light beer compared to other offerings flavor is there without any offense well done
6551,Genny Light,2.84,poured from the can into a standard pint glass  a clear light yellow medium sized white bubbly head that dies down into a compact disk leaving very little lacing  s neutral smell light corn light cereal  t its pretty much average light aal fare corn and little bittering infintely crushable like an laal should be not a ton in the way between this and water  m slick lightmedium bodied standard laal mouthfeel thats very refreshing on a very hot day  o typical laal id recommend the light version over regular for sure especially if youre just looking to drink outside at a bbq at 1424pk or less most places its kinda hard to go wrong with this one if youre going to be outside packingem away
6552,Genny Light,4.84,this is easy drinking light beer nice refreshing taste good feel nice aroma overall a quality light beer which bud light isnt also a great value vs bud light 99cents compared to 229 better taste and lower price genny light kos bud light

6555,Ros√© De Gambrinus,4.28,on tap at singular in bilbao 95a glorious deep ruby no head but some lacing 7s we have got some weird flavors in here pretty funky tart but just enough putrefaction to cause the occasional grimace 9t nailed it bright fruit cold beer perfect finish rather brief maintaste but the strike and the finish are excellent 10m light tart excellent both lingers and effervesces 850 ultimately its the flash in the pan of the dazzling burst of flavor that disappoints somewhat along with that unmucked stall note otherwise excellent

6559,Cruzcampo Pilsener,5,best drink in spainsuper refreshing and an excellent buy in the small cansnice and cold pick me up on any city walk around spainapparently not well regarded but each to his ownlight and refreshing like spring water perfect to keep you going and much better for your health than sugary pop or energy drinkslove this stuff 1010
6560,Cruzcampo Pilsener,2.61,330 ml can bought in tenerife pale golden colour decent head sweetish fruity and grassy aroma notes of maize corn too flavour is watery and neutral with some tolerable hops in the finish acceptable as a thirstquencher but not much more
6561,Cruzcampo Pilsener,2.59,this beer is mocked throughout spain and rightly so only tolerable when drunk ice cold on a blistering hot afternoon in andalus√≠a as soon as it starts to warm even a tad it becomes sweet  sickly it labels itself as a pilsner hmm a pilsner with no hop character at all poor  makes a decent base for a shandy though
6562,Cruzcampo Pilsener,3.72,surprised this doesnt have better ratings everyone always seems to take things out of context or at least thats my assumption on a lot of global lagers like this i mean against all beer yeah its not a standout but against euro pale types its solid and against much of the rest of the spanish lager scene its quite strong see its more a pils than a classic pale lager more grain character without the sweetness more crisp at the end some bittering hops in play and overall a fantastic texture thats dry uplifting almost nitro feeling had this on the glacial draft apparently colder than average and it was delightfully clean and refreshing pretty pour too an inch of permanent and thick white head on top of radiant golden brassy brew lovely clarity some floral character to the hops as it warms a touch metallic as many of them are here then too but a fast finish nevertheless decent body to it more of a german malt thing too less cheap tasting than its peers and frankly a delicious little brew that i could have made an afternoon of i like how it seemed common to serve small pours of this so that constant cold ones could be brought makes awesome sense for outdoor daytime drinking way way way better than its ratings here in my experience
6563,Cruzcampo Pilsener,3,pours a clear golden color with a slight head and lacing aaroma has malts and floral hints ttaste follows the nose with malt and floral flavors ma light bodied well carbonated beer oa decent pils
6564,Cruzcampo Pilsener,3.5,on tap white head with lace golden color clear  earthy and grassy hops bready and biscuit malts typical pils flavor dry and lightly bitter  light bodied easy drinking
6565,Cruzcampo Pilsener,2.79,this smells and tastes really like a typical euro lager  tastes like a damp washing cloth tastes rotten but if you drink it quick enough it tastes boozy this latter is a good point for me but still for only 40 cents this beer is way better than most of the euro lager crap you get for twice or three times more in hungary so no complaints  but no praises either

6568,Cass Fresh,2.84,hey come on it is definitely not awful yeah i know its the same adjunct crp and yeah its watered down and the aftertaste is quite bad and metallic but it feels better than most japanese beers that they have here in japan korean lagers are always better somehow abd not to mention that it goes very well with korean food you cant even feel its aftertaste

6571,Oude Geuze,4.43,bottled on march 21 2018 drank on august 16 2023
6572,Oude Geuze,4.24,poured from 375ml corked  caged bottle into my beeradvocate teku bottled 31319 best by 102639  appearance medium golden hue with a light haze and a frothy but low head of ivory foam pretty  smell a lovely and balanced combination of sweet tart and earthy it has kind of a savory candy thing going on its really great  taste bright and just a bit tart with a subdued sweetness and a good earthy maltiness it many not be super complex but it is very very good  mouthfeel light body with a light carbonation and a refreshing fizziness never having had this before i dont know if thats typical for oude geuze when i popped the cork it didnt seem super carbonated  overall a delicious and refreshing tasty treat on this warm summer day very glad i snagged myself a bottle of this
6573,Oude Geuze,4.5,i have even saving this bottle for a bit it is 2019 vintage recently got a promotion so i wanted to celebrate a bit  really an excellent beer pours a bright golden yellow color with a fluffy white head and excellent curtain lacing smell and taste of sweet and tart appleas and sweet pears rustic earthy and woodsy with a refreshing fruity finish i wish i had another bottle
6574,Oude Geuze,4.47,375 ml bottle blend no 52 season 1819 bottled 13 mar 2019 66 abv purchased single at benash yesterday decanted into my chouffe tulip  l mildlyhazy yelloworange colored liquid messy cap persists after initial pad decay laces a little looks dirty near murky  s textbook nutty lemon rainy spring day smutty penny hints of rustic white bread and apple cider vinegar the nutty breadiness increases as it aerates peppery onion spicy note of sweat  t green grassy earthiness lighting up front of palate moderate ciderlemon brightness in the bottomback of the palate this morning its still raining and this perfectly compliments the aromas aftertaste dry vaguely bready with the nuttiness of a mother the finish has a lovely length and intensity  f satiny spread tingly tang mineral twinge and parch wheated bounce up front sticky funk smearing acid ting numbing the backs of my teeth roof of my mouth my sinuses are opening view brightening longing for more goatlicking sticky texturesbody seem broader more bracing than other brands  o a travesty i never tried this before of course ive hesitated getting their other brands due to cost and seeing myself getting carried away might be my new goto when i get that hankering solid 2138
6575,Oude Geuze,4.5,took me back to belgium at my first taste
6576,Oude Geuze,4.29,fairly clear pour at first it turned a little hazy as i could not properly leave out some of the stuff at the bottom of the bottle there isnt much head to talk of but a thin collar of bubbles shows it isnt a still beer the nose is my favorite part with a lemon spritzed tart nectarine impression with an slight cider vinegar edge and some light funky cheese combine those more acidic notes with backup scent of light cereal malt and even lighter herbal components  on the lighter side with the mix of tangy sour and microcarbonation leavening things the taste isnt quite as complex as the nose with a bit more of a herbaceous bitterness than i expected at least relative to the tartness the beer has an acidic component that pairs with this for sure but on my tongue it seems to go for the sides while the lightly herbal wood tannin note takes up the middle as it warms the sour level slowly increases pushing the more bitter aspect further back on my palate  i loved the nose and my enjoyment of the taste increased as i sipped glad to finally get to review this
6577,Oude Geuze,4.6,pours a straw colour looks beautiful nice head and good lacing is left over as it dissipates  smells of barnyard funk and that sort of sourdough yeast that you get on 3 fonteinen lambics lots of fresh fruit character apricot pear some fresh apple wet straw  the oak barrel comes through nicely lots of funky fruit notes lemon zest apricot orange intangible citrus notes grape skin  medium body with a reeeally long and dry finish the finish is great  this is a fantastic gueuze always worth the price and so consistent
6578,Oude Geuze,5,superb gueze
6579,Oude Geuze,4.32,750ml bottle into a tulip bottled 112118 best by 102638  superb looking beer glowing pale amber body with swarms of carbonation big bright white head persists in lesser form throughout leaving a lattice work of lacing  slightly funky aroma  on tasting not much funk dry sour tart the other word that comes to mind is clean not what you might think of in a gueuze such an easy drinker here a small fruit note  mouth above medium finish a dry sour tartness  overall such a great example of the style hits all the right notes subtle delicate flavorful not a bum note anywhere a bit pricey so a treat once in a while
6580,Oude Geuze,3.62,bottle into glass minimal white head very slightly milky medium light orange amber  golden appearance unusual earthy and almost mildew like aroma with a spiced and touch of vinegar tinge as well definite lemony and touch of clove deep down in the depths of the taste with a light body and tanginess with a little bit of a medium toasted malt underneath
6581,Oude Geuze,4.43,blend 43 season 1920 bottle 4220  its always an honor to drink a gueuze of any kind and this one seems to be one of the most popular at least on ba this is my first 3 fonteinen beer since armand passed so this one goes out to him lets dive in  pours a hazy burnt orange with a finger of white head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing  the funk in the nose is soft it really relies more on fleshy fruit than anything else im picking up on aromas of tart peach jammy apricot lemon juice wet hay white wine stone white pepper light cracker and apple skin  its a bit more forward in taste and still very damn impressive on the front end of the sip im tasting tart apricot orange zest apple skin white wine vinegar stone light leather and lemon juice the swallow brings notes of tannic white wine bready malt lemon zest white pepper stone wet hay and jammy apricot  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a funky and zesty beer finishes mostly dry with more earth than tartness  goddamn i loved this one its very nuanced but not overly aggressive sucks that lambic has to be so pricey but its fun to splurge every now and then
6582,Oude Geuze,4.5,a 750ml corked and caged bottle blend63 season 1819 bottled on 3rd april 2019 served from a 3 fonteinen lambic basket and poured into a 3 fonteinen gueuze glass  appearance a nice clear golden colour with a just over one finger white head that had decent retention while leaving some nice lacing  aroma lightly tart barnyard funky oak hay green apple with light lemon notes  taste sour tart funk oak hay green apple lime lemon with light notes of grape skin  mouthfeel medium bodied with high lively carbonation  overall surprised i didnt review this much earlier for an oude geuze in the core range this is right up there among the best in my opinion along with 3f ag and tilquin oude gueuze i also specifically picked blend63 of season 1819 because its been one of my favourites lately since the paper label blends of 2015 and earlier its just super easy and enjoyable to drink its basically something i could down at all hours of the day
6583,The Wild One,4.04,dark brown in color with a fingernail of beige around the rim and covering half of the top the aroma is of horse blanket barnyard funk and dark cherries im tasting dark cherries horse blanket and barnyard funk the mouth is dry and crisp
6584,The Wild One,4.14,pours a light brownish red with small tan bubbles that dissipate to fast to be really called a head  aroma is light sweet from the grain venous notes from the barrel light tart fruits grapes cherries dryness from the oak hints of brett  taste follows the nose light brown malt notes hints of sweetness soon dominated by the venous barrel notes plus the oak and light brett tartness normally would have trouble finishing a 750 of a tart sour but this one blends all aspects together so its pretty damn drinkable   mouthfeel is light with medium full carbonation without being too much if that makes sense  overall a pretty damn good brew
6585,The Wild One,4.24,clear deep ambercopper color with a minimal tan head toasted grain and dark fruity aroma of grapes and cherries tart cherry oak tannin slight cider vinegar acidity medium bodied goes down easy
6586,The Wild One,4,i understand la folie might have inspired this beer possibly but this one is much better to me taste is about the same but theres more fervor to this one the main plus is this is full bodied where as la folie felt kind ofwatery to me solid brew
6587,The Wild One,4.09,bottle from johnnyhops roughly a year old reminds me of an oude bruin
6588,The Wild One,3.98,medium reddish brown clean pour save a thin cream ring vinous barrel bring out notes of cherry currant flowers light brett and rustic grain earth wine dark oak a whisper of cherry skin hints of lemon and pear decent underripe cranberry and dried prune sour brown malts round out feel is lighter bodied with a tart and vinous light finish doesnt build so the end is kind of bland where you want culmination good for a rainy day
6589,The Wild One,4,sour brown ale made with wild yeast aged up to 8 months in oak foeders 63 abv ruddy brown and fairly clear under a finger of tan foam tangy apple and tannic oak moderately sweet very little bitterness smooth and amply carbonated something like sweet grapefruit flesh in there too 11521 bottling
6590,The Wild One,4,unknown vintage drank 62516 on draft  sheffields  opaque purple appearance  no head no lace  sour dark grape  soft grain notes in the nose  medium thin mouthfeel  dark grape  tart cherry flavors  easy to drink fruity  great for summer the mild tartness adds a hint of complexity but this was more fruit beer than sour
6591,The Wild One,3.68,a beer i have missed on many occasions for 5 years now on tap at my local beer bar how times have changed on tap at das beer garden deep orange with a big white head smells of toasted malt dark fruit and a bit of vinegar acidity tastes of slight vinegar throughout never too much but always present green apple too toasted malt a little bit of a red wine character moderately sour well carbonated and pretty crisp for what it is medium body very good
6592,The Wild One,4.15,on tap at novare
6593,Octoberfest Beer,4.12,coppergold appearance with off white foam that dissipated in a minute or so initial mild aroma that deepened as the beer warmed nice drinker touch of malts come though balanced by a dry smooth finish would purchase again
6594,Octoberfest Beer,2.91,goldenamber smell is grassy and mild the taste is toasted barley malt with hops in the finish that give off a metallic bitterness very drinkable expensive
6595,Octoberfest Beer,3.75,9423 on tap at pies and pints in morgantown  beautiful deep copper look with beautiful tan head  aroma is metallic stone light underlying malt  taste slight bitter to start and finishes dry and nicely balanced in bitterness malt finish is good a very decent offering with a slight toastiness with low sweetness which is a plus for us
6596,Octoberfest Beer,4.35,12 oz bottle best by 01 nov 23  poured into a tree house glass a pretty nice cleanclear golden amber color pretty nice carbonation with a pretty nice thickcreamy onefinger offwhite head which also leaves a pretty nice medium size island and some pretty nice sticky lacing behind the nose is pretty nice malty hoppy with some pretty nice toastyness slight cherry spicy the taste is very nice malty hoppy with a pretty nice touch of toastyness cherries spicyness medium body abv is hidden pretty well with a pretty nice drybitter finish overall this is a pretty tasty beer
6597,Octoberfest Beer,3.44,beer tasting notes  bells octoberfest a copperorange matches the label slight head minimal lacing modest carbonation s get the rich malt right off the bat not particularly roasty or hoppy t good malt flavor a bit of biscuity again no roasty quality i can make out a touch of hop bitterness not a strong flavor doesnt last strongly on the palate though there is a pleasant residual flavor could pound it all day i guess they market it as a session beer so i would agree m medium mouthfeel some fizz from the carbonation o pleasant but lacking roasty character leaves me wanting
6598,Octoberfest Beer,4.23,my favorite oktoberfest of choice made me try more beers as well
6599,Octoberfest Beer,4.36,this pours a rich malty amber brown generous head retention the nose has some caramel malt and a touch of green hops low bitterness but whats there ties things together on the sip as well
6600,Octoberfest Beer,4.5,sweet caramel notes one of the easiest drinking marzens i have had not extremely bitter but enough to have a lasting aftertaste moments after a drink great if youre looking to drink more than one as it is not overly powerful
6601,Octoberfest Beer,3.69,not overly sweet or malty lighter in body and taste than others in this style i prefer this to the overly heavy us offerings
6602,Octoberfest Beer,4.34,my favorite octoberfest beer for 2022 bells continues to produce some very good beers at volume quantities very smooth very drinkable and very tasty
6603,Octoberfest Beer,3.48,15 x 12 ox ml bottle bottle date 07152022 glassware 05 l festmug temp at pour 528 f abv 55  ibus 24   look the color is clear medium copper with what seems to be gold highlights the head starts as 2 fingers of frothy and fizzy offwhite foam that quickly dissolves to ringandislands decent lacing in on the glass  smell lightly toasted grains and bread and lots of them there is also a dry crackery note faint notes of freshcut grass flirt in the background as does an equally faint spiciness  taste a quick hit of sweet caramel comes at the start but is quickly submerged for the most part in toasted malts and grains an earthy spiciness and moderate bitterness then arrive and the sip begins to dry out the sip finishes lightly dry somewhat spicy and moderately bitter  feel crisp with a slightly astringent finish the body feels between medium and mediumlight  overall a shade or two or three too bitter for your typical m√§rzen especially a german one but quite drinkable nonetheless it is not too sweet or caramelly nor overly bitter so it is a decent to solid american okto which for me is equivalent to saying a nice midtolate fallautumn amber lager  my ratings are primarily for this beer as a m√§rzen i would score it higher as an amber lager
6604,White,4.73,lovely palewhite color in the glass good retention on a 3finger head nose is cloves banana orange herbal citrus and a bit of yeasty lemon pee and wheat sweetness most of this follows through on the palate but the banana is less present i do get more grapefruit peel and yeast notes the texture is velvety and creamy one of my favorite beers
6605,White,4.26,pours hazy white with light head aromas of spice and fruit getting grapefruit or grapefruit peel like tastes but very nice overall also notice that there are sour notes which is somewhat unpleasant but because of the other tastes its overall very nice has a medium feel in the mouth  overall one of the nicer wheat beers ive tried
6606,White,4,ive had many a witbier but this was the first i recall that actually tasted like toast surprisingly light but still left me wanting to squeeze a lemon wedge into it great accompaniment to heavy food
6607,White,4.25,12oz can  pours cloudy yellow with an inchplus head of white plenty of tattered lacing and persistent retention hints of spicy citrus in the nose an a wheaty twang light bodied with a creamy soft mouthfeel faint lemon and citrus zest on the palate finishes dry with zero malt a balancing bitterness and fading spice
6608,White,4.94,one of the best
6609,White,5,honestly its like my favorite beer the perfect amount of every quality a beer can have it fits every day and every situation if i cant decide what to buy i buy white
6610,White,4.21,7923 on tap at mad mex at robinson center get together with tom and sarah  this beer was not on my radar to date boy i i have been missing something  beautiful all around look taste and feel citrusy spicy and very drinkable dw not around to help with better description
6611,White,4.87,this classic is a go to summer holiday beer just had it on the fourth of july  when it was hot as hades and this was the balm served cold on a hot day pours pale straw yellow with a frothy head smell light hint of orange taste cracker hint of spice hint of orange light carbonation easy drinking highest recommendation easily one of my favorite beers and a founding father of craft beer

6614,The Mad Elf,4.08,cold bottle into a snifter reasonable foam settles down fast aroma is festive spiced cherry pie tastes like winter in maryland spicy and sweet a tad of tartness too alcohol makes a big noise feel is medium to thick medium carbonation overall nothing to complain about big and bouncy boozy beer good shyt
6615,The Mad Elf,3.86,333 ml bottle freshest by 07102023 consumed on 08 march 2023 glass troegs 04 l tulip abv 11  look clear amber with bubbles continuously rising a 1finger hight beigelight tan head quickly dissolves to a ring and filmy cover leaving ok lacing  aroma fruity sweet and a touch spicy tons of cherries with honey and candi sugar a light note of cinnamon with a hint of cloves and some baking spices  taste what is in the aroma is here the sweet cherries and the candi sugar are more pronounced the cinnamon and other spices are quite a bit sharper the sip dries slightly and does not get cloying but it is certainly sweet and spicy the alcohol is not hidden and provides a noticeable boozy note  feel sharp but also syrupy warm to hot from the alcohol the body is mediumlight  overall this is not my favorite bdsa nor my favorite troegs offering but this makes a decent winter warmer if you like sweet fruity and boozy beers this one is for you  my ratings reflect this beer as holiday beer or a winter warmer which is what mad elf really is i would rate this much lower as the bsda that it is currently listed as
6616,The Mad Elf,3.89,i didnt like it as much as a i thought i would but it was still pretty good
6617,The Mad Elf,4.04,freshest by 07152023 pours an opaque reddish copper into a samuel smith imperial pint glass with a thin tannish head that fizzes and dissipates quickly leaving no lacing malts  cherry forward in the nose with a nice sweet earthy aroma to boot taste follows nose with a tart velvety finish very slight carbonation with the spicy belgian yeast mid tongue a syrupy mouth and noticeable alcohol burn but hey  11 abv its hard to hide this has been a staple in my beer fridge around the holidays for many moons always enjoy kicking back with a couple of these on cold winter nights
6618,The Mad Elf,3.9,11423 poured from 12oz bottle purchased from troegs gift shop  color is a beautiful reddish copper  aroma cherry raisin malt honey dave can pick out the belgian yeast  bright effervescence and smooth silkiness in the mouth  taste is tart cherry malt clove and its boozy almost hotwith alcohol slight metallic finish on the sides of the mouth  not our favorite but its decent enjoy the mix they have on tap if the grand cacoa and mad elf
6619,The Mad Elf,5,awesome my favorite
6620,The Mad Elf,3.54,well this was something else i feel like this is like when you read the recommended dosage on cold meds and say yeah but im really sick and take more then it knocks you out same thing here it says its full of cherries and you say well yeah its probably a little tart but its a belgian dark strong ale so giddy up then it knocks you out with tart cherries and that 11
6621,Negra Modelo,4.69,a great beer and fan of modelo always
6622,Negra Modelo,3.34,it reminds me exactly of a better version of michelob dark and im talkin the dont be afraid of the dark era with martin mull circa 1987  1992 its a very drinkable not heavy dark beer very malt forward so theres no confusing this for an ipa but with this beer thats a good thing
6623,Negra Modelo,3.56,it tastes okay its not a heavy taste but its not a light taste either im not much of an alcohol drinker so two is enough for me and it makes me feel mellow relaxed it would be great to taste this with a shot of evan williams in it dark beer with a shot of evan williams in it just tastes awesome the packaging is very nice with the gold foil top beautiful i also really like the short chuby bottles just a nice presentation  well done
6624,Negra Modelo,5,presentation wise the bottle has a very comfortable shape to hold and it comes in a gold foil wrapper so every beer feels like youre unwrapping a gift its a dark lager so of course it tastes good i wish it was a few dollars cheaper but its a good beer to pick up once a blue moon  style dark lager  tapcanbottle bottle  abv 54  rating 5
6625,Negra Modelo,4.25,one of the best beers for mexican and new mexican food every time i drink this i am whisked back to albuquerque in the 90s eating green chile enchiladas at el patio que rico
6626,Negra Modelo,4,one of my favoritesnice scent and good depth to the flavor
6627,Negra Modelo,3.33,from the back of the bottle printed on glass with white ink spots bb nov 2023 c273b159 1114  appearance the body is a medium shade of dark brown with light hints of golden brown and burnt umber it is a dark beer but it has good clarity and ample carbonation bubbles are clearly visible there is a mediumsized head which mostly has larger bubbles but there are smaller ones surrounding them it has a tobaccostained offwhite head the head retention is pretty good and it slowly fades out to a short cap no real lacing  aroma there is a light toasty caramel scent with a light nutty yeast note  taste it has a light toasted caramel flavor up front the middle of the palate has a bit of a bread character with a nutty flavor it has a bit of a walnut and acorn character some pecan notes come through eventually too a bit of alcohol develops after a few sips the aftertaste is a light herbal bitterness  mouthfeel it straddles the edge between light and medium bodied it feels more medium as it first hits the palate but it doesnt have much texture when moving to the back carbonation feels high but good there is a mild but noticeable bitterness  overall the text on the label states that this is a mediumbodied lager with slowroasted caramel malts brewed for a rich smooth taste that is a pretty fair description of the beer the body feels a tad low but it is a nice beer to drink it has a nutty flavor and aroma which gives the beer more depth as well i probably wouldnt buy it regularly but its an enjoyable beer
6628,Hopora,4.38,nice head retention very smooth and juicy with no off flavors detected a very decent light abv neipa with a lot of flavor and body to it very nice job troegs
6629,Hopora,4.34,opaque hazy yellow big white head excellent retention thin rings of lace lots of mango and sweet citrus aroma just a touch of dank and pine tastes like it smells plus a raw wheat flavor medium bodied fluffy and mouthfilling appropriate carbonation i dont really like most neipas but this one checks the boxes for the style
6630,Hopora,4.18,pours a cloudy wheaty yellow with a white head with some staying power the smell is of grapefruit and other citrus with pine and grain in the background the taste follows the aroma with a hint of oats you can identify the oats in the mouth feel also overall a good solid neipa
6631,Hopora,3.95,a hazy medium gold in color 1 finger white head that receded to a wispy cap with a moderate tight collar nice lacing  s grapefruit with a bit of pine  t mango and orange from start to finish a bit of lemon early and a touch of grapefruit at the end mild to moderate bitterness on the finish  m medium bodied moderate carbonation moderately dry finish no hop burn  o very nice

6634,Mornin' Delight,5,i dont know about first thing in morning  but then again 
6635,Mornin' Delight,4.25,on tap at oshea homebrew in san juan capistrano ca  if the sugar plum fairy and cookie monster made a baby im sure this is what mrs plum fairy would lactate i mean damnwe are talking sweet that said its all kinds of balanced and on point like nailing a bullseye at darts before you drain your first beer what is raul getting at here yeah he doesnt play darts md is good but not rauls thing i guess thats what i meant happy to try it unlike my one and only time at raising canes but ill happily move on after having it
6636,Mornin' Delight,4.7,whats not to like about this beer from the time i opened it until i finished the last sip the aroma in the room was that of maple and coffee it was like a dessert being prepared before you and the scent lingering in trying to attract you its mouthwatering to an extent this is one of those things in life that tastes just like it smells delight is exactly what it is i am thankful they upped the limits this year because its hard to keep my hands off the bottles when i open the fridge cheers
6637,Mornin' Delight,4.71,appearance  the beer was black in appearance with a smooth body that showed little visible carbonation and a modest tan head  smell  pancakes were immediately brought to mind with notes of coffee and maples syrup in the nose it was like breakfast for dinner  taste  as with the nose it was like breakfast for dinner the maple syrup seemed to saturate the stout permeating the body the beer was not overly sweet but was balanced by the coffee notes it seemed as though the coffee was washing down the sweetness notes of semisweet chocolate same toward the back but the overall profile of chocolate chip pancakes with maple syrup lingered  mouthfeel  the body was thick but not quite motor oil quality this made the beer more drinkable than the average heavy stout carbonation was still very present  overall  the beer was definitely hype worth unlike some other tg beers it was relatively easy to obtain
6638,Mornin' Delight,4.74,2022 variant  bottle split 4 ways  pours a a rich black with a nice mocha foam into a tulip overpowering maple on the nose and was a little worried that this was going to be too sweet for me and too much of a dessert stout but the taste was so well balanced  maple sweetness was well calmed by the roasty coffee and bakers chocolate flavor  while md was easier to obtain this year from a volume perspective this was not a cheap bottle to get to pittsburgh haha  overall  well worth it and while some of the shine might have worn off this beer nationally given its more readily available its still a world class pour glad i have a bottle left
6639,Atrial Rubicite,4.5,atrial rubicite yeah im not going to even try with that you might as well tell raul to read james joyce either way like a drunk irishmen at the pub this one is a bullseye its perfect in nature like nature  carry one my children
6640,Atrial Rubicite,4.79,blend 11 from may 2021 51 abv from a 750ml bottle just about perfect for a wild ale for me still a delightful balance of pure jammy fruit essence bacterial sourness and funk and oak tartness this is what raspberries are made for

6664,Juicy Bits,4.43,in my 45 years ive called six different us cities home none of those six have been greeley colorado and frankly its not a likely candidate to become number seven however thats not because i dont appreciate it i currently live nearby and for all the st it catches it beats a lot of other places the artistic talent the agriculture the communitythe beer its all underappreciated and underrated so with that in mind i review a beer i never wanted to like but nonetheless fell in love with and have in my refrigerator almost all the time  appearance these days this beer pours about the same orange color as the can it comes in well maybe more like the slightly more yellowish orange band around the bottom of the can thats the perfect fit its pretty opaque even for a hazy ipa a fresh printerpaper white head rises slightly above the surface with a heterogeneous mix of bubble sizes its not a tall head but it holds its ground despite the opacity there is still a sense of liveliness in the bubbles rushing up the sides of the glass  smell i get orange peel vanilla and lactose in equal parts on the first sniffpretty much every time underneath theres a piney character with a touch or fresh cut grass the latter of which compels that first refreshing sip  taste orange from the nose is still present but now its in 3rd or 4th place if i didnt know better i would think that yuzu was added to this brew tastes like lemon  honey but even if its just the hops those two flavors ring strong an pleasant earthiness provides the basebackbone to the palate a nice bitter finish begs for the next sip  mouthfeel it seems sweetat first but it isnt it may be bittersweet but its dryer than it feels like it should be that sweetness as mentioned above gives way to that dry bitter finish the body is somewhere between lighttomedium and mediumheavy its oddly hard to tell and sort of depends on your mood i dont think ive ever written anything like this in any of my previous 500 reviews its a unique feel  overall i refused to drink this beer for over a year after it came out the hype train was too much for me i did not want to like it deep down i knew i would a friend basically forced me to try it one night and the first sip was pure gold is it life changing no is it perfect hazy ipa no that status is reserved for beers named le jus well get to that another time so what is this its a legendary example of a relatively new style of beer and one of colorados finest examples of creativity experimentation and mostly high quality execution nice job weldwerks youre legendary

6669,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,3.8,canned november 2019 pour is as dark as beer comes with a small amount of shortlived head aroma is better than expected given the age plenty of cocoa and chocolate with some almost coffee like elements really nice smelling beer taste has also held up really well lots of smooth chocolate semisweet and well balanced with some nice roasted notes overall pretty good beer im impressed with how well this has held up
6670,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,4.23,drank from a 1 pint can purchased at tree house brewing company charlton ma 2022 served in a tree house brewing company tulip  the beer poured a syrupy and rather intense looking pitch black hue an inchtall tight and creamy mocha colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick lasting collar streaks and drops of lacing stuck all along the sides of the glass  the aroma was decent initially and definitely improved with time moderately roasty with dayold coffee notes bit of acrid character and perhaps some raw cocoa too as the beer sat sweet creamy lactose notes appeared good dose of vanilla as well chocolate syrup was also noticeable the sweetness and the chocolate character intensified as the beer sat  the flavor profile was also solid but perhaps not as smooth as the nose malty and robust up front roasted malts were most apparent moderate caramel malt presence too cold coffee was also noticeable subtle lactose and vanilla notes were detectable in the center slightly sweet more roastiness on the back end and the finish moderate amount of bitterness some alcohol warmth came through as well  nice creamy smooth mouthfeel medium bodied for the style slightly syrupy the liquid contained a finer beaded somewhat prickly effervescent that turned fluffy on the palate  all that is and all that ever will be is an enjoyable beer though not as impressive as its ratings might suggest both the flavor profile and the mouthfeel came across as a bit flat i feel like many of tree houses imperial milk stouts definitely suffered in quality when they moved from bottles into cans
6671,Abbey Ale,4.44,tastes like a nice belgian dubbel to me i was hoping for stronger aroma but the taste makes up for it i was surprised to actually pick out a little licorice taste at first but very subtle and blended in nicely as you go along with the slight orange and the requisite fig and date flavor which is what i love about belgian dubbels overall a very nice authentic tasting dubbel ale at a decent price well done sign me up
6672,Abbey Ale,4.1,world class dubbel made right in the usa
6673,Abbey Ale,4.01,pours a muddy copper with just over a finger of head the nose is mildly funky and malty with a touch of raisin essence the flavor follows the nose with a blast of malty sweetness followed by a long dry finish

6675,Abbey Ale,4.34,solid copper appearance with a large tan head and good lacing malty aroma serves as a backdrop for an array of dark ripe fruit complex taste rolling out notes of ripe fruit licorice seasonal spices and caramel alcohol a bit more noticeable in the aftertaste mediumtofull bodied moderately carbonated mouthfeel leading to a dry spicy finish
6676,Abbey Ale,4.39,i love belgian style beer and like golden monkey abbey ale delivers  color is ruby with a great head upon the pour i smelled figs and currant the taste very much the same  had neon rainbows from the same producer and have learned if they do one great most are great there a few exceptions

6681,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.06,look  bright copper and clear with a nice off white head smell and taste  classic citrus grain imperial ipa feel  medium body with a lighter crisp carb overall  fairly standard but still nice
6682,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),3.75,big citrus and pine resin notes taste follows suit with ripe orange and grapefruit fins hint bitter very soft mouthfeel overall well above average
6683,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.58,a rice ipa super clear golden looks like a budweiser but with a nice lacing smooth slightly sweet kuhnhenn call it west coast ipa but the high abv and sweetness covers up much of the bitterness very good but not a classic west coast reminds me of a founders hopslam tender says they get that comparison often but that kuhnhenn came out with the dripa five years before founders figured it out
6684,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.01,12 oz can from tavour hazy golden pour fizzy head aroma is hoppy and lghtly fruity taste brings smooth malts with a huge hoppy bite light orange minimally sweet bitterness stays on the palate sublime smooth and strong
6685,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.17,appearance  this is a very hazy dull yellow with a nice offwhite head that dissipated rather quickly  smell  the big lemon stands out in this unsweetened fruit nose lots of citrus and a bit of straw  taste  more lemon at the taste and a bit of malts that were hard to find at the nose the hops are resiny with a hint of pine and very little sweetness  mouthfeel  this is mediumbodied and extremely dry the dryness is massive at the finish probably too much for the uninitiated  drinkability  good thing the bitterness slows you down because at nearly 10 abv it is a heavy hitter
6686,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.71,fantastic nice hope flavor but crisp clean refreshing great beer
6687,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.98,hard to top this one hits the spot kicks you when you get home

6689,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.25,had 2022 vintage on tap at the bine 20230420  really nice sweet but roasty creamy vanilla and chocolate and coffee
6690,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.54,look it pours very dark brown with a brown head it has low head retention  smell it has strong coffee aromas with chocolate there are some vanilla elements with light wood the alcohol is noticeable  taste it has strong coffee and chocolate flavors there are some wood elements with vanilla there is a very low brownie batter like flavor in the background  feel it has strong but pleasant alcohol warming with a bitter finish the bitterness is a little sharp but certainly not overpowering  overall its has strong alcohol but its not hot the chocolate and coffee flavors blend well together with a few background compliments
6691,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.41,finally got to try this i must say for the price it was well worth it look dark as night smell bourbon coffee light vanilla taste well balanced coffee upfront bourbon on the back end feel medium body overall great beer and great value 699 for a 12 ounce bottle
6692,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.09,a nice ba coffee stout very thin for todays market which is an attribute in general to me but this one goes a little too far into the cold brew coffee territory  nose is excellent light roast coffee floral notes over dark chocolate classic diner coffee and some charred malt taste follows with the cold brew coffee note taking the lead  great stuff not sure its worth the premium over regular speedway everyday but now and again it definitely is
6693,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.44,great look black with a good amount of tan head smell is amazing with coffeevanillaoakbourbon taste is a little too much bitter coffee but the barrel starts to shine one it warms way up tad thin for my preference overall an excellent beer
6694,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.34,2022 bought for 15 at alesmiths brewery in san diego ca for a beer tasting with my buddy ron just a few quick notes because during these tastings i dont spend too much time writing  as decent caramelcolored head with some lacing black but not jetblack colored beer the aroma has chocolate and caramel components and is not in your face  tm the vanilla dominates the beer is light but flavorful oaky is a major component as well 142 is very deceptive especially before it warms the mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium the carbonation is on the higher side of medium  overall very solid would recommend
6695,Thule Export Beer,3,thule from viking brugghus picked up a rest stop stored overnight in hotel reefer served at whatever temp the reefer is in a room glass bottom of can stamped bf 01 may 2022 reviewed 31721 note that i use ddmmyy protocol appearance  4 first pour  light straw srm 2 clear body  light straw srm 2 clear when rearlite same head  average maximum two cm white medium density short retention fizzy diminishing to a 05 cm ring of bubbles and a thin cap lacing  scant a few broken pieces aroma  275  begins grainy with dms no hops no malt no yeast flavor  275  begins slightly bitter with a taste of grain no malt no hops no yeast no ethanol 50 abv as marked on the can taste or aroma no gastric warming no diacetyl oddly no dms palate  35  thin watery lively carbonation final impression and summation 325 looks good otherwise disgusting
6696,Thule Export Beer,2.5,nothing exceptional just a good local lager i guess
6697,Thule Export Beer,3.1,while gull is the most ubiquitous and terrifyingly sweet beer around reykjavik thule appears to be the preferred alternative outside the city  its an absolutely okay american adjunct light floral aroma medium sweetness decent cereal roughness theres nothing at all exceptional about the beer other than its much more quaffable than gull  this probably wont withstand international travel too well but if youre in iceland its a decent standby
6698,Last Buffalo In The Park,4.52,man this beer ruled when i first had it definitely one to drink fresh and not age ton of coconut and barrel i dont hear a ton about fb these days but this beer was great
6699,Last Buffalo In The Park,4.29,both last snow and this in the same year neat jet black body with a brown head standard but well done huge coconut right away in the nose bourbon is present but light get bakers chocolate and caramel more taste is surprisingly similar while coconut laden nose is fun want more barrel for the taste malt work stabilizes the complexion though with velvet smooth coffee setting in near the finish the feel is very smooth but it is light in both body and barrel coconut defines somehow even more than ls like last snow better but still a nice porter coconut fans this one is for you
6700,Saint Lamvinus,5,this was drank almost a week ago at v√≠tor claros home  the winemaker from portalegre behind the domin√≥ and claro  ferreira brands  trying to review this from the top of my mind  poured from the bottle to a stemmed wine glass  a the body is dark purple with a light purple almost pinkish head created a generous foam quantity that lasted quite a while before jumping in s the aroma is actually perfect without any overpowering acidity its balanced as it is sweet savory and acidic to the right point its a great beer only by smelling it t its the taste of heaven i think that after foufoune this might be my favorite cantillon beer its perfectly balanced with the sweet notes from the grain and the grapes embracing quite well the light fruitiness and very light bitterness of aged hops combined with just the right amount of acidity incoming from brettanomyces its really great with nothing to point to as a downside m body has just the right feel being light with the cool effervescence and silky tones from the sweetness you can find in this beer bitterness is low acidity is mild o as said before this ranks at the top of my favorite beers unbelievably good
6701,Saint Lamvinus,4.3,on tap at armsby abby  great red counterpoint to vigneronne huge barnyard funk in the aromas with a bit of red wine coming through in the back tart tannic and winey in the flavors maybe a bit vinegary but thats how it is with cantillon basically the liquid equivalent of farmhouse cheese  86100
6702,Saint Lamvinus,4.22,5 oz tiny snifter draft pour at monks for zwanze day 2022 review copied from scant notes taken on my phone  band aid plum powder malty lipsmacky fuller bodied  what i can add from memory for me this is the one from that first flight that had the most personality and i think my drinking buddy would agree he being a luster of red wine i believe this beer poured near brilliantly clear making its reddishpurple hue more vibrant and alluring mwahaha its slight phenolic note definitely hits first and firm while its fruity flavors take a few moments to surface the plum flavor for me wasnt so much fresh fruit as it was a ghostly concentrate essence of floral fruity aromatics lingering in the background would love to try it again from a bottle 2039
6703,Saint Lamvinus,4.24,pours a rich deep purple brief pink head that settles to a thin ring light lacing taste is tart fruit up front balanced by a mild noble hop character mushroom earth grass lots of lingering oak barrel character as well feel is crisp and clean a very good expression of both grape and barrel without letting these elements overwhelm
6704,Saint Lamvinus,4.39,on tap at armsby abbey  welp i inadvertently ended up here for zwanze day i was at a show right down the road at palladium and figured id come here after only to find some true whales of mine its finally time to see what their grape lambic is all about  pours a clear reddish purple with a finger of light pink head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  its quite soft in the nose but theres still the requisite funk im picking up on aromas of red wine vinegar lemon juice wheat bread wet hay stone and sharp oak  theres more bite to it in taste but conversely less grape on the front end of the sip im tasting wildflower honey lemon juice straw apple skin red grape light toasted oak and a hint of cherry the swallow brings notes of lemon zest wet hay sharp oak red wine vinegar crabapple light blueberry and pear skin  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a sharp beer finishes bone dry and tart  damn this is awesome stuff not quite on par with fou foune but its always nice to try cantillon
6705,Saint Lamvinus,4.84,2019 bottle  consumed 81222  i love the funk and balance of tartness and dryness a superb fruited lambic
6706,Porter,3.26,pours darkest brown into my guinness glass tall head that shrinks to about 13 inch and stays  no strong smell to me  tastes more bitter than i expected it would lots of roast coffee dark cocoa flavors no real sweetness im not getting the graham cracker that the label tells me about lots of dark chocolate still  feels good medium body not light at all but not heavy not much carbonation sting a little on the top at the front but it fades before the swallow  overall good if you want to drink unsweetened cocoa and get a buzz
6707,Porter,4.28,very dark black coffee color with ruby highlights moderate but lasting milk chocolate colored creamy head and some decent lacing the aroma is dark roasted malt coffee burnt toast dark chocolate some hints of caramel and vanilla the taste is all of that with a bit more emphasis on the burnt toast and dark roast coffee giving a pleasant bitterness the body is mediumfull moderate carbonation creamy smooth very drinkable and inviting altogether this is an outstanding example of a robust porter incredibly smooth moderate bitterness very enjoyable even better as it warms up a little
6708,Porter,4.29,not had in a few years  this is a classic done right pours just short of black with a finger of creamy tan coloured head nose strikingly chocolate some vanilla and coffee roasty but the chocolate shines the palate is attacked more with the roasty notes  coffee a bit of char hint of vanilla and a dark chocolate bitterness that betrays the more milk chocolate nose medium mouthfeel  creamy with a lasting cafe au lait bittersweetness smooth as heck
6709,Porter,4.71,very good porter
6710,Porter,4.53,on tap at the brewery  appearance very dark brown nearly black small tan head lingered and left moderate lacing  nose rich roast  mouthfeel medium enough carbonation  attack omigoodness  roasted malt dominates deep flavor  the beer shines here just the slightest smokiness  finish gentle bitterness from the malt  perfect  overall outstanding flavor clearly deserves its 1 rating in its category
6711,Porter,4.71,always keep some in my frig
6712,Porter,4.14,had on tap at bulldog saloon lynnwood wa
6713,Porter,4.34,appearance absolutely black out pitch black in all regards with no red or brown on the edges the pour produced a hefty three fingers of offwhite head  aroma lots of roast and i mean a lot its like a cup of coffee though i dont think it is specifically brewed with any coffee i get some sweet caramel notes and even some vanilla a good hint of chocolate syrup rounds out what is turning into a decadent dessert beer  taste i tell ya that roast from the aroma is singing just as loud and proud here on the taste its bordering on burnt coffee but is reeled in just enough where it is just dark roast with that comes a big blast of bitterness but it is quite pleasant my next swig just got me a ton of that chocolate syrup which brings us right back to dessert beer territory subtle caramel notes in the front and the end is more of that coffee bitterness  mouthfeel not too thick but not watered down very smooth and velvety as the brewers description prepared me for despite all that coffee bitterness it is a pleasure to drink and it doesnt leave behind a sticky film despite all the sweet flavors  overall lives up to its reputation and then some its a robust porter at a reasonable abv and is available year round a winner in all aspects
6714,Porter,4.08,a fairly straightforward brew not as sweet or milky as i expected from the nose expresso dark chocolate hoppy bitterness i get the graham cracker and faint sweetness taste is rich and unfortunately mouthfeel lacks silkiness to support that overall pretty good though i prefer their stouts
6715,Porter,4.58,bottled 2123  poured into a willi glass at fridge temp and letting warm up  pours a deep brown coffee totally opaque and with a tall head aggressive pour my bad but leaves behind a fine and spidery lacing with a tall domed cap settled into a 14 ring with no signs of disappearing 45  off the bottle i get some dark and roasty coffee but accompanied by a fair bit of sweetness too off the glass i pick up the same but the sweetness gives off a bit of char and a bigger dose of roasted malts 45  dark coffee again char good punch of hop balance bitterness of coffee starts to come out as it warms up 45  body is incredibly soft and rich with a slight oiliness and mouthcoating carbo is very light and delicate even for being freshly bottled i could swear it was aged 475  overall likely the best porter ill ever have and was not left disappointed at all 475
6716,Porter,4.17,a jet black with some brown mixed in brown fluffy head looks great  s huge roasty malt chocolate espresso toffee  ttoasted malt some bitterness smoke oak butterscotch  m thinner than expected but good  o its almost a stout and its great
6717,Porter,4.25,a highly hopped brew with coffee chocolate  roasted and burnt flavor the color is inky black but balanced the abv is well hidden at 65 overall if you like espresso you will like this beer
6718,Porter,4.25,poured into a tall clear pint glass matte black in appearance brown head around a finger thick  aroma dark chocolate smokecharred wood espresso roasted malts dark fruit toffee dark caramel nuts  taste follows the aroma mostly comprised of the dark chocolate espresso and smoky flavor hoppy and not as sweet as the smell may suggest body is mediumlight
6719,Miami Madness,4.45,cloudy orangey yellow body white head smells and tastes exactly as expected but even more potent and balanced absolutely huge guava passion fruit and mango with cutting wheat and salt backed by lemon cracker and lactose but here is the thing i came in expecting this to be underwhelming but the intensity and depth of the fruit flavor then met with contrasting berliner backbone is impressive feel reflects with tart juice up front dry and snappy wheat on the back end lingering light sweet and salty textures is appreciated though this is certainly a new world take
6720,Miami Madness,3.97,l hazy orange with a slight white head that disappears quickly  s guava mango juice and passion fruit in that order  t restrained fruit compared to what the nose let on not a bad thing as i am not a fan of alcoholic juice tart lemon and guava up front mango on the back end  f light bodied dry and puckering finish  o really good fruited sour a bit overhyped in my opinion though
6721,Weihenstephaner Festbier,3.69,pours crystal clear golden yellow with a thick white head nice lacing beautiful looking beer aroma is faint some biscuit a little malt flavor is a bit sweet in front biscuit yeast malt delicious feel is light bodied and adequately carbonated overall a fantastic beer
6722,Weihenstephaner Festbier,4.05,these folks make the best hefeweizen on the planet so i was curious to try this fest beer  i guess i shouldnt be surprised that its pretty damn good  i wonder if this is made for american consumption like so many of these are or this is what theyre actually drinking in the old country
6723,Weihenstephaner Festbier,3.88,absolutely lovely festbier from pour to finish crystal clear light gold medium carbonation but effervescent and light feel nose is not particularly complex whatsoever light malts but nothing to write home about this is more than made up for though by a clean and crisp bready and malty taste with a light and fluffysweet finish delicious
6724,Weihenstephaner Festbier,3.54,very nice head with good lacing a bit hazy the smell is very muted l can only pick up a hint of malt taste is where its at a light bread citrus slightly sweet honey very nice feel is also way up there very light on the palate with very smooth carbonation  overall l have to say this is a true fest bier with a 58 abv prost
6725,Weihenstephaner Festbier,3.71,81923 poured into my heidelberg stein from a 12 oz bottle purchased at washington beer store in washington pa  look is a clear dark straw with white lacing and head  not much in the aroma lager slightly soapy malt comes through tin as well  bright and light with a decent malt backbone slight lime tones high carbonation makes this quite refreshing
6726,Weihenstephaner Festbier,4.21,a well made festbeir clear light gold appearance with a 2 inch white head not much lacing aroma and taste is balanced and smooth no problem drinking a few of these in the august heat
6727,Devil Dancer,4.76,drinking this triple ipa with my boys keith and greg on the patio on a hot summer night in dallas brings back great memories so dank and so dirty like the pine tar from george bretts bat mixed with the sweat from a neanderthal woman physically and psychologically one of my favorite dirty bird beers ever i love you founders
6728,Devil Dancer,3.96,12oz bottle courtesy of whyteboar according to the stamp on the rear label this was bottled on january 16 2020 perhaps not ideal for a normal ipa but as the same rear label makes clear this aint no normal ipa as it clocks in at a fierce 12 abv  poured into a tulipshaped hybrid glass dont know what else to call it this was a dark amber color taking on a rubyish hue when held up to light about an inch or so of beige colored foam was present as head and left a decent amount of lace for such a strong beer  nose was of herbal grassy hops bready malts plus a little bit of band aid type aroma as it warms it gets a bit boozy  more promising in the flavor department than in the nose grapefruity piney peppery and bready  this is a big beer that makes a big impact on the taste buds quite a bit of alcohol heat is present unsurprisingly for a triple ipa from the midwest theres a massive malt backbone so for the hops to stand out as much as they do there must have been an ungodly amount used  medium to full body with a coating resiny almost syrupy mouthfeel  this is a beast i imagine this is a beer that is very expensive to make and get why its not widely distributed at this point enjoyed this in the middle of the afternoon on a day with no commitments outside the home and thats probably for the best thank you for getting this to me craig its one ive long been wanting to try
6729,Houblon Chouffe,4.81,was getting weary of ipas this one breaks the mold fresh clean not overly bitter great flavor
6730,Houblon Chouffe,4.44,oof this chouffe packs a punch pours a golden amber big soapy head decent carbonation with a fullish feel hints of wood and fruity florals on the nose follows with hoppy goodness botanicals as promised and possible citrus zest in the aftertaste complex and delicious love belgian blonds but this is converting me to ipas
6731,Houblon Chouffe,4.86,reviewing again because i am bored in this shit country that is not ukraine  this for me is probably the best beer ever that is commercilly available  i spend a lot of time drinking beer the belgians know how to brew and the americans know how to add hops this is a perfection of both and commerciallly available definitely unlike carlsberg one of the best beers in the world
6732,Houblon Chouffe,4.35,112 oz bottle fridge cool into a can glass gold haze raises up a fantastic foam spider web lacing throughout the experience aroma is sweet belgian yeast with quality piney hops and plenty of botanicals little banana deep dive to clove a surprisingly nice bit of funk taste is of a well made belgian tripel with a blast of hops and all that goes with that description finishes slightly sweet and punctuates with a dry and bitter note medium mouth generous carbonation this effort stands above other breweries doing the style cigar citys cosmic crown coppertail unholy for example and is a well crafted recipe
6733,Houblon Chouffe,4.75,i had this on draft 3623  the hopleaf  opaque orange appearance  big offwhite head strong lacing  peach wheat strawberry  orange peel notes in the nose fruity bliss  soft medium mouthfeel peach strawberry soft wheat  faint orange peel flavors  a soft citrusy delight delicious
6734,Houblon Chouffe,4.53,an outstanding belgian ipa a great marriage of flavors and i like the pine aroma and flavor associated with west coast ipas excellent body and long finish sublime
6735,Houblon Chouffe,4.06,for a belgian take on an ipa this is pretty interesting like a hopped up blonde ale  a nice change of pace from my american ipas
6736,Houblon Chouffe,4.53,poured from 112ounce bottle into a tulip glass clear golden color with a thick white head and orange highlights excellent head retention with gorgeous sheets of lacing as it receded aromas and flavors of rose petals up front  followed by notes of herbal hops and orange unmistakable umami character with a dry and bitter finish an excellent beer that drinks well below its 9 abv
6737,Double Sunshine,4.69,poured from the can into a lawsons branded tulipgoblet glass canned april 26th 2023  beamin juicy orange colored body with a touch of haze and light visible carbonation three finger forming head a bit of soapy and big bubbled appearance which pops easily with light retention still manages to stick around and leave a tall collar as well making a nice crowned appearance  delicious aroma hop pressing front nose with light citrus and faint touching juicy tropical notes a nice creamy touch almost sweet vanilla mixing with a light caramel and crispy malt quality comes off like hinting of light powdered sugar on fruity pancakes quality  the mouthfeel on this is just unreal an intense solid backbone that is creamy with just a light touch of pushing sweet tones on the palate the mid hits with thick thick controlled orange and pine notes mixing sweet cream and orange and pineearth heat bitterness comes in the finish so ever slowly with first notes of tangerine and christmas spices then with lingering notes of pepper and wood bitterness campfire like warmth in the back palate that just slowly sits and churns with all the orange and spices you can imagine  fantastic ipa and hardly any hint of big abv now that i think of it just killer stuff
6738,Double Sunshine,4.85,this stuff is an absolute treat  l pours a deep golden yet clear in the glass fluffy white head of 3 fingers lasts through the session  s smells of grapefruit citrus dank hops and sweet bread malt  t grapefruit and sweet malt dominates the beginning the hops come into play by this point and play very nicely with the grapefruit these dank citusy notes do not overpower and keep the beer tasting fresh it finishes clean especially for a dipa  f nice level of carbonation feels smooth and finishes clean incredibly drinkable for a session just be careful with dipas with this level of drinkability  o incredibly well balanced dipa with an excellent flavor profile this might be my favorite dipa i have tried to date
6739,Double Sunshine,4.02,a little disappointing overall a solid ipa but just expected better after having sips of sunshine surprised at the perfect 100 rating a more citrusy flavor than sips with a noticeable grapefruit taste and not as smooth id recommend as a much lighter double ipa for those that dont prefer the heavy types
6740,Palate Wrecker,3.94,shared 12 fl oz bottle kindly provided by abemorsten abv is 95 hazy orange colour large white head strong aroma of orange marmalade and fruity and resinous american hops the flavour is indeed a palate wrecker  that is why this beer was chosen as the last beer of the evening at our tasting extremely hoppy flavour but still in its own weird way fairly well balanced  mainly because the malty sweetness seems just right to stand up to the hoppiness grapefruit resin  pine and spruce yes it is a typically american double ipa and ive seen it before but still oh so good halleluja
6741,Palate Wrecker,4.25,as bitter as they come
6742,Palate Wrecker,4,from old undated notes poured from the bottle  bright orange color  small white head no lacing  smells strongly of high grade marijuana  medium mouthfeel bordering on thick  taste is of grapefruit and great ganja booze is present but not overpowering  a delicious beer
6743,Palate Wrecker,4.06,good solid imperial ipa not up there with the best but nice and solid in tap at industry public house on leahs bday weekend in pittsburgh good ending for lunch  add 72920 trip home from lancaster after joy and andys wedding yes its a palate wrecker

6745,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.25,great example of the style medium to high carbonated with a long lasting foam head no lacing super zesty and crispy mouthfeel and aroma pleasant aftertaste
6746,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.07,well the back label unfortunately fell off of this one so the bottling date is unknown at least its a weizenbock so even if its older its probably holding up pretty well its always fun to try this style since you rarely see them and this is one of the classic examples lets crack it open  pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  the nose here is very bright yet gentle at the same time im picking up on aromas of orange zest sweet homey bready malt overripe banana clove toasted grain floral hops toffee and bubblegum  in taste it seems more raw and unrefined leaning hard into the phenols on the front end of the sip im tasting bready malt sweet honey clove burnt sugar bubblegum earthy wheat peppery hops and light banana the swallow brings notes of clove banana bread sweet honey toffee orange zest black pepper light toast and earthy wheat  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a creamy beer finishes neutral and balanced  its not the best example of the style but still damn good worth trying if youre into weizenbocks
6747,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.09,cloudy amberorange appearance medium light carbonation with an above average body has a creamy thick feel which adds up to a really nice feel aroma is banana banana breadclovemaltbreadand earthy taste is mildly sweetbanana breadfresh banana clove malt and bread overall an excellent well done beer
6748,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.28,500 ml bottle  pours a cloudy golden color bright white head great head retention aroma of golden wheat and spicy phenols similar flavor starts off with herbal clove spiciness then finishes with sweeter grainy malt good balance medium to fuller bodied coats the mouth overall very enjoyable

6752,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.47,featuring primarily malt and yeast this beer is very creamy hints of banana and cloves while definitely not overbearing are presented alongside a healthy bread like texture that is just a pleasure to drink festive yet somehow everyday classic german workmanship
6753,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,4.6,can into a willi trillium neipas are so consistently good if i had one complaint its that this was a little hot with the hop burn which hey its galaxy  sometimes that happens  but it wasnt horrible and the flavor more than made up for it explosion of tropical flavors bright vibrant with a great mouthfeel a top notch hazy

6758,Newcastle Brown Ale,3.81,look brown on the pour which yields an offwhite to beige head that builds and quickly settles to a film leaving spotty lacing behind aroma caramel toffee warm brown bread piloncillo light roasted tree nuts and wafts of earthy notes taste starts out with subtle bready malt notes along with the bread layers of sweetness trickle in with caramel and piloncillo being the dominate two closes with bread and earthy notes mouthfeel full clean mediumhigh carbonation soft and smooth and fairly soft on the finish overall this is good stuff a classic og and the first big bold and flavorful microbrew i tried besides the few aals i had had at that point in my beer journey almost 18 years ago and still a good one good malty nutty and sweet flavors in good combination with enough earthy hop presence to not come across as sweet fun to revisit and recommended if for some reason you have never had it
6759,Newcastle Brown Ale,3.92,i miss the old clear bottles with  it being brewed in england i believe its made in colorado now still a decent little brown ale nothing special
6760,Newcastle Brown Ale,3.64,pours a dark shade of brown crystal clear light brown dense and creamy head retention in form a thick uniform film moderate initial lacing  nose is caramel malty sweetness weak watered down coffee some darkened toast and damp woodsy smell  taste is malty sweet a dark toffee like taste weak earthy coffee with minor generic hop note on the finish  body is light but slightly sweet and syrupy to me smooth though with a low but noticeable bitterness on the finish  i liked the flavors of this beer a lot but it was just a little overly syrupy on the tongue to me
6761,Avec Les Bons Voeux,3.93,750 ml corked  caged bottle from vinmonopolet nettbutikken abv is 95 slightly hazy golden colour huge white head aroma of spicy belgian ale yeast white kandij sugar syrup and spicy hops the same spicy notes in the flavour also sufficient malts hints of yellow plums not too sweet bitter finish refreshing for its strength
6762,Avec Les Bons Voeux,3.75,nice saison farmhouse flavour malty spicy had no clue it was so strong really hides it with the dry finish feels close to westlake triple honestly
6763,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.06,10 oz snifter draft pour at frisco taphouse in crofton md the description is pretty accurate  notes of banana lemon clove and belgian yeast esters fairly sweet and also boozy i agree that this is edging towards being a tripel  which is not really what i want when i drink a saison i like saisons to be more on the delicate side and this is definitely not a delicate beer still a good beer justwell i am tempted to say its not true to style but this is brasserie dupont were talking about so i wont say it
6764,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.35,poured from 750 ml bottle to a chalice glass poured beautiful gold color with a white head on top that didnt go away lively body with carbonation throughout smell was grainy apples and cinnamon funky earthy tones taste starts a bit sweet with bread and grain then the earthy funk kicks in with yeast and strawgrassy flavors finish is rather dry and the funk lingers feel is light and bubbly as the carbonation keeps it alive a crisp dry finish is the perfect end overall this is great sipper with a lot of interesting flavor id buy this again for sure
6765,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.43,the beer pours a voluminous white and fluffy head that takes a while to dissipate while the beer itself is a clear metallic amber color that looks very good  the smell is delicious it has a mix of fruity notes and light bread notes mixed with an earthy bitterness from the hops  the taste is fantastic the belgian spice notes dominate the taste at first but the apple and pear notes come in rather quickly without displacing the yeast notes there is also a light caramel taste to it as well while the beer starts sweet it starts to become more bitter than sweet quickly the earthy bitter hop notes come out towards the finish to round out the beer  the feel is amazing it starts off with a bit of stickiness before becoming fairly dry the carbonation is tingling while the texture is fluffy smooth with a medium body to it  overall this is a fantastic beer worth getting and having if available
6766,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.19,the progression from refreshingly sweet to drying and somewhat bitter is very enjoyable
6767,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.49,purchased from the international beer collector christmas sale in november 2021 and drunk in july 2022  the beer comes in a sturdylooking green corked bottle theres a satisfying pop and hiss as the cork is pryed loose followed by a whiff of smoke and an immediate orchard fruit scent at the neck of the bottle  on the nose as previewed at the opening theres peach and apricot spicy yeast vanilla and pepper wow ive not even had it in my mouth and i can tell its going to be something complex and special  in the mouth spicy belgian yeast dominates at first but the orchard fruits quickly announce their presence there also the vanilla from the nose and bitter orange peel and candied lemon at the swallow there is substantial earthy bitterness thats quite sharp and not at all what i was expecting the finish is dry but the bitterness lingers long after the swallow  mouthfeel is luxurious its smooth and counteracts the lingering bitterness well theres quite a bit of carbonation but the sweetness bitterness and bubbles all work together seemlessly a followup mouthfeel demands attention  overall this is a magnificent beer theres complexity that isnt always evident in saisons or farmhouse ales which takes the beer beyond the standard belgian yeast lemon candy and pepperherbal profile that those styles can fall back on i cant remember a better saison or farmhouse ale and in fact cant remember too many better beers full stop  cheers
6768,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.18,vinous and elegant with orchard fruit impressions plumping it up and a tangy yeast funk drying it out quite a brew stone fruits like peach and apricot accompany white wine grapes with a twang on the finish  amply carbonated and lightly spicy with notes of cardamom clove ginger and nutmeg sediment on the finishing pour

6772,V.S.O.J.,4.57,canned 62921  now this is a special one the highest rated english barleywine on ba vsoj a long time want of mine i wanted to try it while i have the double barrel vsoj on the way thanks to tavour ive had the og straight jacket and some variants before but this is by far the most exciting lets get into it  pours an opaque dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing  the nose brings an intense wave of sweetness but its balanced out by spicier notes im picking up on aromas of burnt caramel sweet whiskey molasses rye bread golden raisin brown sugar charred oak old leather fig tobacco and sweet toffee  wow everything in taste is kicked up a notch boozy and fruity but not overly sweet on the front end of the sip im tasting fig sweet toffee burnt caramel black cherry molasses dry oak vanilla earthy whiskey and light brown sugar the swallow brings notes of sweet whiskey charred oak molasses rye bread tobacco raisin brown sugar burnt caramel vanilla old leather and light toffee  a medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a slick beer finishes a tad sticky and boozy yet still drinks well below the listed 15  oh yeah this is one hell of a beer as expected from revolution its so much thinner in execution in relation to the flavor i cant wait to try the double barrel vsoj next
6773,V.S.O.J.,4.8,oh damn this absolutely lives up to its reputation nothing unfamiliar in a barleywine here but there is a lot going on and everything is so big 24 years in barrels adds such a layer of profundity to the already stellar straight jacket i feel underdressed semiliterate and unwashed sipping on this  raisins molasses high end whiskey and leather dominate there is a lot more at the edges though candied nuts honey pipe tobacco and a hell of a lot more such enveloping deep warmth but not at all hot people with access to revolution are lucky indeed thanks so much fbarber
6774,V.S.O.J.,4.26,12oz can at share dark brown pour with a foamy beige head aroma is malty toffee prunes  hint of vanilla taste is malty leathery sweet caramel light chocolate pit fruit smooth and strong aroma of malt chocolate caramel vanilla and bourbon malty and caramelly flavor with chocolate and raisin leading into a vanilla and bourbon finish had side by side with straight jacket and this one definitely smelled and tasted more chocolatey and caramelly more decadent world class bw
6775,V.S.O.J.,4.71,pours a rich dark brown color that is impenetrable by light and features a creamy mocha colored head that lingers a bit before dissipating to allow you to focus on the beautiful beer in your glass and the aromas drawing you closer  and what magnificent aromas greet you  rich english toffee vanilla a bit of fig oak and a smidge of booze all in perfect balance i am literally drooling  the toffee is forward on the taste as expected but it willingly allows room for the vanilla hurray oak double hurray and especially the fig cubed hurray that provides balance to the sweetness of the other components and coasts into the boozy warming at the back of the palate simply stunning flavor profile and nuance to a beer this big 138 abv  the mouthfeel is creamy and more than a bit oily as expected i sat on this a bit and it was more than worth the wait truly a world class english barleywine
6776,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,4.25,16oz can purchased from the fridge as a 4pack for 1749 canned on 8102023 so this is just over one month old  look nice clarity perhaps a slight chill haze it is a beautiful rich copper color this could totally pass for a festbier there was a finger and half of offwhite head that eventually dissipated to a thin layer there is a steady stream of very tiny bubbles rising up the circumference of the glass  smell nice aromas of grapefruit orange zest peach gummy rings mango melon papaya and pineapple its also piney and there is a bit of dankness even though there are a lot of fruity notes the nose is balanced and its not leaning towards fruity or tropical after swirling the glass there is a bit of a vegetal note that is oniony the nose also has a creaminess to it nice caramel malt note undertones  taste wow this is really good the taste basically follows the nose  it has all of those flavors coming through in a surprisingly balanced way and the flavors are also intensely delivered the finish is moderately bitter with tons of orange zest and grapefruit pith on top of a tasty caramel malt backdrop the finish is not sweet and also not super dry but definitely leaning towards dry  feel very nice mouthfeel  its medium plus bodied with a slightly viscous mouthfeel yet its very drinkable the beer has a lingering chewiness it has very soft smooth carbonation  overall its delicious of all of the daisy cutter versions that i have had base pale ale double daisy cutter and double daisy cutter  nelson i think that this is by far my favorite i also love going back to the regular daisy cutter pale ale but this is more unique and complex and obviously its a bigger beer i also like how of all the double daisy cutter versions that i have had this one is most true to the original i also prefer a west coast style imperial ipa to a new england style one and this beer is definitely west coast style as an aside i love the colorful label design with the mosaic stained glass depiction of the daisies which is very clever and appropriate for the double daisy cutter  mosaic double pale ale  from instagram mosaic ddc is built on a similar malt bill as daisy cutter then goes all in on mosaic hops hand selected in yakima this double pale ale leans to the west coast as the heavy dry hop of mosaic presents fresh peeled grapefruit  dank blueberry aromas with underlying resin  ripe allium lingering a clear deep golden color lifts a dense billow of white foam full bodied with lush mouthfeel our latest ddc flows with dewy bright aromas  flavors  from the can mosaic lupomax mosaic t90
6777,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,4.21,pours a light copper color with two big fingers of head the nose has bright notes of oranges and lemons the citrus carries over into the flavor profile but it is not as bold as the nose would suggest there is a residual sweetness that contrasts nicely with the bitterness of the hops on the finish

6783,Dancing Man,4.61,l pours a beautifully cloudy burnished amber and even with a fairly careful pour formed a fourfinger head of dense offwhite foam plenty of tiny bubbles visible racing from the bottom  s a delightful bouquet of ripe wheat bubblegum clove and white grape  t at the risk of redundant repetition delightful seems again apropos each sip opens with a lovely slurry of clove and banana flavor with some pear and white grape notes developing as it moves across the tongue by the swallow some light citrusy coriander tones join in and linger alongside the clove for the aftertaste  f that is as lush and pillowy as one could want a wheat beer to feel the phrase cream of what came to mind as a descriptor for this brews mouthfeel  o that is decidedly impressive for a us brewed hefe dan clearly picked up a trick or two during his time at ayinger ill be trying to find this and bubbler any time im able to get near wisconsin during the brewing window
6784,Dancing Man,3,the spice in this one is strong overpowering to the point of being funky did not really like that
6785,Dancing Man,4,a good wheat beer can taste the banana and i believe cinnamon a tasty and smooth drinking wheat a bit of of a dryness which i have not tasted in other wheat definitely a wheat i would buy again
6786,Dancing Man,3.84,bottle reads e221 consumed on 32621  pours a lightly hazed coppertinted golden body sporting a rangy effervescence and capped with two fingers of rocky fluffy white foam good head retention leaves a thin layer of craggy cap a thick frothy collar and broad uniform webs of lacing holding firmly to the walls of the glass  aroma brings charry bubblegum and firm almost mineralic yeasty spice opening with a distant waft of stone fruit underlying earthy clove over the middle and subtle banana expanding from a background position across the olfactories is established and direct while sweeter clove evolves to close the bouquet  taste offers peppery spice and raw clove upfront into subdued yeasty characteristics persisting over the midpalate toward a decidedly wheaty back end where tinges of earth flaked malts and a slight minerality phase into a wisp of booziness sneaking through the finish  mouthfeel shows a light body along with a fluffy puff of airy carbonation phasing easily to a crisp wavering consistency appealing to a slightly thinning quenching lightness on the palate eventually firming up on the back end as a taut flaky textures finishes  while an assertive profile accentuates some classic stylistic touches alongside a slightly more modern earthy twist the booziness remains somewhat apparent across this higheroctane hefeweizen
6787,Dancing Man,4.24,12oz bottle etched at bottom edge of bottle is 0203260043738 slightly cloudy deep gold colored body bit of a gusher upon removing the cap two fingers of high head after pouring big burst of effervescence following the pour leaves behind a few spots of foam aroma of banana and bit of cloves and cinnamon taste of banana and spices along with the sharp wheat note a touch of both sweet and spicy a flavor of green apple comes in at the end the yeast esters continue into the aftertaste medium for mouth feel and for smoothness the higher abv delivers a bite quiet in the mouth with minimal carbonation easy to drink because of the low carbonation feel in the mouth and the slight dryness that calls for another quaff
6788,Alter Ego,4.9,179 yum
6789,Alter Ego,4.46,feeling a bit spoiled after sampling a good variety of th past couple weeks this is a solid delicious neipa all around and does not disappoint the wowfactor of some of their other offerings puts this in perspective though as just a fantastic beer
6790,Alter Ego,4.6,very similar to julius but a bit less sweet with a bit more backend bitterness as it warms berry notes begin to appear i slightly prefer it to the original
6791,Alter Ego,4.55,poured with a crazy foamy head dark yellow color and opaque a very unique nose grassy and peppery less hoppy than most treehouse beers and malty sweet very soft feel overall a great beer and definitely a unique beer amongst treehouses hazy collection
6792,Alter Ego,4.64,alter ego is an american double ipa that boasts a complex hop profile with notes of citrus pine and tropical fruit the beer has a hazy golden color and a medium body the flavor is wellbalanced with a moderate bitterness that is countered by a subtle sweetness from the malt the beer finishes dry making it easy to drink and leaving you wanting another sip overall alter ego is a tasty and wellcrafted beer that drinks like a tree house session even though it clocks in at 68
6793,Alter Ego,4.29,16oz can courtesy of roguer   orangehoney color id call it highly hazy or cloudy in appearance but not truly opaque like some neipas thick creamy looking head colored somewhere between offwhite and beige lots of lace and sticky globs of foam adhered to the sides of my teku as said head dropped  aroma is reminiscent of tropical fruits melons stonefruits and grapefruit big hoppy nose to this in a way that straddles the neipa and wcipa styles curious to see if the beers hoppiness is as dramatic in the taste  up front its actually a little less intense than i was expecting its definitely a fruit forward beer in terms of the flavor hitting the taste bud beachhead but its a bit more restrained at the finish it is sharply bitter almost grassy and quite dry this sharp dryness seemed to mellow as it warmed a little after opening  soft slightly creamy mouth feel  im not sure this is my new favorite hazy but itd be in the conversation and id hit it regularly if it were local to me thanks for this andrew

6801,Double Bastard Ale,4.31,strong biting ale light copper color thin smooth consistency a better big brother to the regular arrogant btard ale
6802,Double Bastard Ale,3.85,this stuff is rugged not my favorite style but apparently a good representation of it just too much hop bite and burn for me to truly enjoy definitely a fun time trying it out though
6803,Double Bastard Ale,4.2,this is a good one taste like a big hoppy loaf of raisin bread in the best way big and beautiful and surprisingly clean i could drink this one all night until i pass out
6804,Double Bastard Ale,4.21,2016 vintage  here we go beer number 666 and a 101oz bottle at that i paid over 100 for this but i think its gonna be worth it splitting this thing with my boy lets unlock the mini padlock and pop this baby open  pours murky reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  this has definitely lost its intense hoppiness over time but this honestly smells great now like a lightly hoppy barleywine im picking up on aromas of sweet brown sugar molasses toasted pecan earthy hops caramel golden raisin and light toast  where it was charmingly old in aroma this is a bit too old and faded in taste its not necessarily bad but its showing significant age on the front end of the sip im tasting earthy hops fusel alcohol caramel malt and light fig the swallow brings notes of brown sugar toasted pecan brown bread and nutty malt  a medium full body pairs with very mild carbonation resulting in a smooth yet slightly hot beer finishes mostly dry with a mild earthy bitterness  its not the best beer in the world but im still happy to have gotten this big bottle ill have to see how i feel after finishing the big ass bottle
6805,Double Bastard Ale,3.75,650 ml bottle cardinal pub  bar stavanger abv is 11 hazy reddish brown colour moderate offwhite head strong aroma of american hops piney notes also caramelized orange marmalade some alcohol very hoppy flavour medium sweet caramel and alcohol bitter finish hints of solventwarming mouthfeel theres plenty of hops in this one surprise surprise but this is probably not where you go when you look for balance

6807,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,4.68,poured into a pint glass at about 47f color is like a typical everyday tea light brown and crystal clear with a beige head that lasts a minute or two then settles as a fairly thick film of fine bubbles and this lasts a good while smells is a typical oktoberfest style hoppy lager with a nice malt bill of bread and brown sugar hops come out in the taste with a subtle but defined bitterness that causes the brew to finish quite dry which i think is a very good quality not syrupy not overbearing alcohol is almost nonexistent carbonation is excellent medium mouthfeel which results in a fairly creamy brew that balances the hops and malts very nicely of course this is a germanstyle beer so expect a semisweet lightly bitter brew that finishes fairly dry overall id highly recommended this oktoberfest marzen
6808,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,4,my second authentic marzen and did not disappoint trying to stock up now for the fall such a solid beer for the price
6809,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,3.84,bottle poured into glass mug a brownpenny colored minimal head and lacing pleasant streams of bubbles s notquitesweet roasty malt maybe a touch of floral character a bit of hop bitterness to round it out t i get roasty malt right up front the faintest taste of coffee which lingers  pleasant hop flavor bitterness on the lengthy finish if there is an alcohol taste it is masked by the toasty flavor m medium bodied not particularly fizzy o really enjoyable has the characteristics i look for in a marzen im drinking this on a pleasant summer evening but this beer is definitely meant for autumn  edit to add 20 min later after finishing ive still got a pleasant lingering finish  very nice

6811,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,4,coppercolored brew with a large white head toasty sweet aroma on the sweet side but not by any means too sweet soft carbonation theres a slight spiciness among the malt flavors and also a fruity note that reminds me of apple

6814,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,3.86,pours a very clear amber color with a finger width foamy head head retention is mild lacing is decent aroma of belgian yeasts apples and breadiness bready taste with belgian yeast flavors ends in a small amount of apple at the end light bodied with moderate carbonation
6815,Oktoberfest M√§rzen,3.96,look semi clear golden with a thick fluffy white head  aroma toasted bread grassy hops  flavor toasted bread a hint of banana and a little bit of grassy hops  bodyoverall light to medium body it is easy and light drinking

6817,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,4.15,pint can into a mug clear pale straw color with a small white head that quickly faded to a thin film toasty malt and cracker aroma with a hint of honey and melon bready malt flavor with some mildly astringent hop bitterness extremely wellbalanced smooth and very drinkable i can certainly envision myself slamming one too many of these at a fest
6818,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,3.92,pours a clear light golden color with a nice head and lacing aroma has hop hints the taste follows the nose with a well balanced hop flavor a light bodied decently carbonated beer a good festbier
6819,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,3.85,112 oz bottle poured hard into a boston lager glass the head looked nice but didnt last at all but otherwise it looks nice unfortunately the scent just isnt strong enough once the head dissipates the flavor though makes up for it light malts but theyre definitely the backbone very little bitterness but the hops add nice floral notes they work well together here highly carbonated but id appreciate a little more body overall a nice beer for this time of year though i hope to try the marzen soon
6820,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,4.07,was interested in how the festbier compared to the marzen honestly i might prefer this one  crystal clear and highly carbonated though not quite as much as a pilsner otherwise is very similar in shade maybe just a touch darker smell is honeyed malt sweetness crackery pilsner and a slight hop floral note taste offers a surprising amount of fruit hint of banana at the beginning but it quickly overcome by a wine or ciderlike dry fruitiness pears apples and grapes breadiness is here on the back of the palate but it is not the primary note there is very little toastiness to speak of perhaps a tiny bit and id say thats the main difference between this and marzen mouthfeel has the carbonation battling the thickness from higher alcohol a bit undecided is this supposed to be a heavy or crushable drink but not bad the dry aspect is what really makes it easy to drink but i cant help but think id be sick of it by two anyways i guess in a sense it needs to cater to both crowds people who want a strong drink vs people who want a session if its the only thing being served at an oktoberfest though  kind of like an imperial helles overall i think i like it about as much as a good marzen but this style fits the warmer early autumn weather a lot better ill take my marzen after october
6821,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,3.97,the german version with a label best by date of 032024 picked up at a local grocery store while buying food for the week a bunch of festbiers have hit the shelves so why not looks smells and tastes like a good helles not sure the difference a bit sweeter than most light lagers this is definitely crushable in large mug form
6822,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,4.01,surely i would drink gallons in the tent
6823,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,4.06,a wellbalanced and highly drinkable lager pours a clear golden yellow has a malty but not roasted malty backbone and finishes with a coppery slightly metallic aftertaste that i associate with paulaner as you might expect it pairs very nicely with the classic salty and savory beerfriendly fare like sausage and pretzel
6824,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,4.04,16 ounce can into a pilsner glass canned 32121 had 9121  pours a bright clear golden color with a two inch plus foamy head and a good amount of foamy lacing active carbonation aromas of malt light caramel some bread light white grapes smells herbal and somewhat grassy similar flavors malt bread light caramel and white grapes tastes herbal and spicy with a light hop bitterness smooth a very good light body well carbonated  not a style i frequent but really like this nicely balanced between the hops and malt dont know if the grapes are my imagination or not but either way its a pleasant surprise very enjoyable
6825,Focal Banger,4.75,heady topper has a thick offwhite head and a mostlyclear golden appearance with lots of suspended sediment throughout the aroma is of citrus hop resins and white bread it has a similar flavor with strong bitterness focal banger has a medium body and a mostlydry finish  rjt
6826,Focal Banger,4.49,this is a classic right up there with heady and deserves to share the hype of the other in every way its similar but different in slight and satisfying ways cant believe it took me till a decade later to get around to this treat
6827,Focal Banger,4.55,enjoying on the front porch gorgeous cool august day the 18th 2023 canned on 81523  so excited to find this treasure at our washington beer store  gorgeous strawlight golden color slightly hazy with white foam of tiny bubbles dissipated quickly leaving fine lace on glass edge  very fruity aromas of pineapple papaya mango luscious lemon and even malt  immediate bitter hits the tongue which gives way to the fruit flavors and ends sharp grapefruit rind  this hits all the right notes for an excellent neipa for me leah prefers the sweeter heady topper whereas ill stick to this one as my favorite  edit we had bought two cans and we drank the second one fiber nights after the first one i had worked hard on a pool electrical job in the sun that day and wow what an intense beer to drink after a hot day on the sun by the time we were on the porch it had cooled off considerably and it was raining drinking this focal banger was pure joy pine hop depth in your face hoppy bitterness pure joy
6828,Focal Banger,4.68,l  hazy golden with a large thick white head that sticks around leaving behind a good amount of lacing s  fresh bright piney resinous bitter hops floral notes fresh grass grapefruit and other citrus notes and malt t  follows the nose fresh bright piney resinous bitter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with grapefruit and other citrus notes with a nice malt backbone slightly dank f  medium leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation smooth o  another world class ipa from alchemist  a softer version of heady
6829,Focal Banger,4.5,picked up a fourpack from the stowe brewery 72923 for 13 canned 72523 consumed the first two for review 73023  beer poured a hazy golden with a nice white head that has sustained hang time  nose is very nice fresh citrus abounds from the glass long after pouring  taste is spot on the light pale malt base displays the grapefruit forward hops and it tastes like the pink grapefruit fresh off my tree at my old phx house in the spring finishes with a superb rind and pine bitterness 710 on my scale  mouthfeel is light bodied with each sip very refreshing  overall yep the hype is correct on this one this is a world class ipa
6830,Focal Banger,4.34,canned on 71823  just 15 days ago  drank most from can as directed but did pour 4 oz amount in rocks glass for appearance  appearance  the beer pours a lightly hazed limeyellow color with a small head of white foam the head has a good level of retention fading slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass  smell  the aroma is strong of a grapefruit and herbal hop smell mixed with notes of cracker malt and a touch of bread and toast other hop aromas of pine and earth are there as well with all the aromas having a fresh raw like smell hints of caramel and a sizeable grass like smell are there as well giving a rather green smell overall  taste  the taste begins with a crisp cracker malt body paired with a lot of the raw hop that was present in the nose an herbal hop is the biggest but is accompanied by a decent showing of grapefruit as well other light earthy flavors mix in as time goes on all while a little bit of caramel and orange that were present upfront fade the grass that was in the nose also joins the scene all with a bit of an increase in the hop toward the end the fresh hop taste steps it up even more giving a quite heave hop pellet like taste to linger on the tongue  mouthfeel  the body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a moderate carbonation for the mix of big fresh hop with crisp body the middle of the road mouthfeel balances the two attributes rather well  overall  a rather fresh raw hop pellet tasting ipa i like it but in some ways a bit unbalanced with bitterness at the end certainly a great brew although i am not sure it deserves as much hype as it gets
6831,Focal Banger,4.35,hell of a good tasting beer i get some bitter citrus and a snappy hop bitter finish would not call it hazy by any standard based on taste im drinking from the can as per instructions so cant say anything about the look  tasty beer but at a tough price point for my blood now and again if i see it
6832,Focal Banger,4.64,pours a hazy yellow color  aroma orange and papaya a little bit of pineapple  taste follows the nose some malty sweetness balanced with citrus pith  overall this is a wonderfully balanced beer nice fruity flavors with just the right amount of bitterness an outstanding hazy
6833,Focal Banger,4.86,amazing like i was told they say leave it the can but i poured it into my can glass lol

6836,IPA,4,served up in a pint sparky and sting notes of pine and grapefruit taste is chewy and strongly fresh and bitter with a thick middle and a heavy bitter finish very good
6837,IPA,3.8,poured from a 12oz can  on the pour 3 fingers of white well supported head were present that forms nice damage body is a deep deep gold with super fine carbonation rising up  aroma is super bright and happy with an overhanging darkness bright floral fruity and dank with a sweet malt not the most balanced  flavor is more balanced than the aroma and the malt comes off as less sweet there is a piney and slightly citrus hop note up front that slowly builds in bitterness and darkness solid slightly sweet and bread malt backbone some herbal hops are present as well i realized  feel is very full and verging on heavy the malt is mouthcoating and the hops are too not overwhelming but very full with a slight hint of alcohol  overall this is pretty good but id argue not quite world class could be crispier and the hops could have a more focused flavor probably best to go into this expecting an imperial english ipa because this has some english hop vibes as well

6839,IPA,4.25,12oz can date stamp on bottom lip looks to be 092723 but is more likely 032723 because of the hourminute stamp included clear pale gold colored body one thick finger of white head and this turns into a thin cap and high ring leaves behind some wide rings of lacing aroma of citrus and pine pine grapefruit and resin bitterness taste follows the nose with orange grapefruit and pineapple joined by pine resin bitterness a little sweet but with a bitter tail end very good toasted malt base medium mouth feel with a touch of nectar clean and drying finish some tongue numbing excellent carbonation classic west coast ipa with enough juice to be thirst quenching
6840,IPA,4.28,from a stovepipe as mother nature intended pours like a classic wcipa with a generous cap of foam on top light aroma with a touch of pine and a little floral note the malt doesnt assert itself leaving it crisp on the finish
